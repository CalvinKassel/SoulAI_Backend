The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations

Preface What is a "quotation"? It is a saying or piece of writing that
strikes people as so true or memorable that they quote it (or allude to
it) in speech or writing. Often they will quote it directly, introducing
it with a phrase like "As------says" but equally often they will assume
that the reader or listener already knows the quotation, and they will
simply allude to it without mentioning its source (as in the headline "A
rosè is a rosè is a rosè," referring obliquely to a line by Gertrude
Stein). This dictionary has been compiled from extensive evidence of the
quotations that are actually used in this way. The dictionary includes
the commonest quotations which were found in a collection of more than
200,000 citations assembled by combing books, magazines, and newspapers.
For example, our collections contained more than thirty examples each
for Edward Heath's "unacceptable face of capitalism" and Marshal
McLuhan's "The medium is the message," so both these quotations had to
be included. As a result, this book is not---like many quotations
dictionaries---a subjective anthology of the editor's favourite
quotations, but an objective selection of the quotations which are most
widely known and used. Popularity and familiarity are the main criteria
for inclusion, although no reader is likely to be familiar with all the
quotations in this dictionary. The book can be used for reference or for
browsing: to trace the source of a particular quotation or to find an
appropriate saying for a special need. The quotations are drawn from
novels, plays, poems, essays, speeches, films radio and television
broadcasts, songs, advertisements, and even book titles. It is difficult
to draw the line between quotations and similar sayings like proverbs,
catch-phrases, and idioms. For example, some quotations (like "The opera
ain't over till the fat lady sings") become proverbial. These are
usually included if they can be traced to a particular originator.
However, we have generally omitted phrases like "agonizing reappraisal"
which are covered adequately in the Oxford English Dictionary.
Catch-phrases are included if there is evidence that they are widely
remembered or used. We have taken care to verify all the quotations in
original or authoritative sources---something which few other quotations
dictionaries have tried to do. We have corrected many errors found in
other dictionaries, and we have traced the true origins of such phrases
as "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch" and "Shaken and not
stirred." The quotations are arranged in alphabetical order of authors,
with anonymous quotations in the

middle of "A." Under each author, the quotations are arranged in
alphabetical order of their first words. Foreign quotations are,
wherever possible, given in the original language as well as in
translation. Authors are cited under the names by which they are best
known: for example, Graham Greene (not Henry Graham Greene); F. Scott
Fitzgerald (not Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald); George Orwell (not Eric
Blair); W. C. Fields (not William Claude Dukenfield). Authors' dates of
birth and death are given when ascertainable. The actual writers of the
words are credited for quotations from songs, film-scripts, etc. The
references after each quotation are designed to be as helpful as
possible, enabling the reader to trace quotations in their original
sources if desired. The index (1) has been carefully prepared---with
ingenious computer assistance---to help the reader to trace quotations
from their most important keywords. Each reference includes not only the
page and the number of the quotation on the page but also the first few
letters of the author's name. The index includes references to
book-titles which have become well known as quotations in their own
right. This dictionary could not have been compiled without the work of
many people, most notably Paula Clifford, Angela Partington, Fiona
Mullan, Penelope Newsome, Julia Cresswell, Michael McKinley, Charles
McCreery, Heidi Abbey, Jean Harder, Elizabeth Knowles, George
Chowdharay-Best, Tracey Ward, and Ernest Trehern. I am also very
grateful to the OUP Dictionary Department's team of checkers, who
verified the quotations at libraries in Oxford, London, Washington, New
York, and elsewhere. James Howes deserves credit for his work in
computerizing the index. The Editor is responsible for any errors, which
he will be grateful to have drawn to his attention. As the quotation
from Simeon Strunsky reminds us, "Famous remarks are very seldom quoted
correctly," but we have endeavoured to make this book more accurate,
authoritative, and helpful than any other dictionary of modern
quotations. TONY AUGARDE (1) Discussions of the index features in this
preface and in the "How to Use this Dictionary" section of this book
refer to the hard-copy edition. No index has been included in this
soft-copy edition. See "Notices" in topic NOTICES for additional
information about this soft-copy edition.

How to Use this Dictionary HOW TO.1 General Principles The arrangement
is alphabetical by the names of authors: usually the names by which each
person is best known. So look under Maya Angelou, not Maya Johnson;
Princess Anne, not HRH The Princess Royal; Lord Beaverbrook, not William
Maxwell Aitken; Irving Berlin, not Israel Balin; Greta Garbo, not Greta
Lovisa Gustafsson, Anonymous quotations are all together, starting in
"Anonymous" in topic 1.68 They are arranged in alphabetical order of
their first significant word.

Under each author, quotations are arranged by the alphabetical order of
the titles of the works from which they come, even if those works were
not written by the person who is being quoted. Poems are usually cited
from the first book in which they appeared. Quotations by foreign
authors are, where possible, given in the original language and also in
an English translation. A reference is given after each quotation to its
original source or to an authoritative record of its use. The reference
usually consists of either (a) a book-title with its date of publication
and a reference to where the quotation occurs in the book; or (b) the
title of a newspaper or magazine with its date of publication. The
reference is preceded by "In" if the quotation comes from a secondary
source: for example if a writer is quoted by another author in a
newspaper article, or if a book refers to a saying but does not indicate
where or when it was made. HOW TO.2 Examples Here are some typical
entries, with notes to clarify the meaning of each part. Charlie Chaplin
(Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin) 1889-1977 All I need to make a comedy is a
park, a policeman and a pretty girl. 'My Autobiography' (1964) ch. 10

Charlie Chaplin is the name by which this person is best known but Sir
Charles Spencer Chaplin is the name which would appear in reference
books such as Who's Who. Charlie Chaplin was born in 1889 and died in
1977. The quotation comes from the tenth chapter of Chaplin's
autobiography, which was published in 1964. Martin Luther King 1929-1968
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. Letter from
Birmingham Jail, Alabama, 16 Apr. 1963, in 'Atlantic Monthly' Aug. 1963,
p. 78

Martin Luther King wrote these words in a letter that he sent from
Birmingham Jail on 16 April 1963. The letter was published later that
year on page 78 of the August issue of the Atlanta Monthly. Dorothy
Parker 1893-1967 One more drink and I'd have been under the host. In
Howard Teichmann 'George S. Kaufman' (1972) p. 68

Dorothy Parker must have said this before she died in 1967 but the
earliest reliable source we can find is a 1972 book by Howard Teichmann.
"In" signals the fact that the quotation is cited from a secondary
source. HOW TO.3 Index If you remember part of a quotation and want to
know the rest of it, or who said it, you can trace it by means of the
index (1). The index lists the most significant words from each
quotation. These keywords are listed alphabetically in the index, each
with a section of the text to show the

context of every keyword. These sections are listed in strict
alphabetical order under each keyword. Foreign keywords are included in
their alphabetical place. The references show the first few letters of
the author's name, followed by the page and item numbers (e.g. 163:15
refers to the fifteenth quotation on page 163). As an example, suppose
that you want to verify a quotation which you remember contains the line
"to purify the dialect of the tribe." If you decide that tribe is a
significant word and refer to it in the index, you will find this entry:
tribe: To purify the dialect of the t. ELIOT 74:19

This will lead you to the poem by T. S. Eliot which is the nineteenth
quotation on page 74.

It is really mortifying, sir, when a woman possessed of a common share
of understanding considers the difference of education between the male
and female sex, even in those families where education is attended
to...Nay why should your sex wish for such a disparity in those whom
they one day intend for companions and associates. Pardon me, sir, if I
cannot help sometimes s uspecting that this neglect arises in some
measure from an ungenerous jealousy of rivals near the throne. Letter to
John Thaxter, 15 February 1778

Mirth is short and transient, cheerfulness fixed and permanent....Mirth

mind, and fills it with a steady and perpetual serenity. 'The Spectator'

The Knight in the triumph of his heart made several reflections on the

the works of a little genius, who not only knows but scrupulously
observes them. 'The Spectator' no. 592, 10 September 1714.

that I can drink With him that wears a hood. Though I go bare, take ye

alphabet set up for printing\] I can conquer the world' may derive from
this riddle, but probably arose independently.

La grande phrase reçue, c'est qu'il ne faut pas être plus royaliste que
le roi. Cette phrase n'est pas du moment; elle fut inventèe sous Louis
XVI: elle enchaîna les mains des fidéles, pour ne

laisser libre que le bras du bourreau. The big catch-phrase is that you
mustn't be more of a royalist than His Royal Highness. This expression
is not new; it was coined under the reign of Louis XVI: it chained up
the hands of the loyal, leaving free only the arm of the hangman.
Chateaubriand 'De La Monarchie selon la Charte' vol. 2, ch. 41

Laisser-nous-faire. M. Colbert assembla plusieurs Deputès de commerce

commerce at his house to ask what could be done for commerce; the most
rational and the least flattering among them answered him in one word:

Oeconomique' Paris, April 1751.

Libertè! Ègalitè! Fraternitè! Freedom! Equality! Brotherhood! Motto of
the French Revolution, but of earlier origin. The Club des Cordeliers
passed a motion, 30 June 1793, 'que les propriètaires seront
invitès,...de faire peindre sur la façade de leurs maisons, en gros
caractéres, ces mots: Unitè, indivisibilitè de la Rèpublique, Libertè,

the front of their houses, in large letters, the words: Unity,
indivisibility of the Republic, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity or death'.
In 'Journal de Paris' no. 182 (from 1795 the words 'ou la mort' were

Only---but this is rare--- When a belovèd hand is laid in ours, When,

another's eyes read clear, When our world-deafened ear Is by the tones
of a loved voice caressed--- A bolt is shot back somewhere in our
breast, And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again. The eye sinks inward,
and the heart lies plain, And what we mean, we say, and what we would,
we know. 'The Buried Life' (1852) l. 77

The Sea of Faith Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore Lay
like the folds of a bright girdle furled. But now I only hear Its
melancholy, long, withdrawing roar, Retreating, to the breath Of the

And naked shingles of the world. Ah, love, let us be true To one
another! for the world, which seems To lie before us like a land of
dreams, So various, so beautiful, so new, Hath really neither joy, nor
love, nor light, Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; And we are

flight, Where ignorant armies clash by night. 'Dover Beach' (1867) l. 21

O born in days when wits were fresh and clear, And life ran gaily as the

upon the Aral Sea. 'Sohrab and Rustum' (1853) l. 886

That vast portion...of the working-class which, raw and half-developed,
has long lain halfhidden amidst its poverty and squalor, and is now
issuing from its hiding-place to assert an Englishman's heaven-born
privilege of doing as he likes, and is beginning to perplex us by
marching where it likes, meeting where it likes, bawling what it likes,
breaking what it likes---to this vast residuum we may with great
propriety give the name of Populace. 'Culture and Anarchy' (1869) ch. 3

Nothing could moderate, in the bosom of the great English middle class,

Criticism' Second Series (1888) 'Shelley'; Arnold is quoting from his
own essay on Byron in the same work.

More and more mankind will discover that we have to turn to poetry to
interpret life for us, to console us, to sustain us. Without poetry our
science will appear incomplete; and most of what now passes for religion
and philosophy will be replaced by poetry. 'Essays in Criticism' Second

The difference between genuine poetry and the poetry of Dryden, Pope,

'Literature and Dogma' (1873) preface

Terms like grace, new birth, justification...terms, in short, which with
St Paul are literary terms, theologians have employed as if they were
scientific terms.

'Literature and Dogma' (1873) ch. 1

The true meaning of religion is thus not simply morality, but morality
touched by emotion. 'Literature and Dogma' (1873) ch. 1

Conduct is three-fourths of our life and its largest concern.

But there remains the question: what righteousness really is. The method

Wordsworth says somewhere that wherever Virgil seems to have composed
'with his eye on the object', Dryden fails to render him. Homer
invariably composes 'with his eye on the object', whether the object be
a moral or a material one: Pope composes with his eye on his style, into
which he translates his object, whatever it is. 'On Translating Homer'
(1861) Lecture 1

Of these two literatures \[French and German\], as of the intellect of
Europe in general, the main effort, for now many years, has been a
critical effort; the endeavours, in all branches of
knowledge---theology, philosophy, history, art, science---to see the
object as in itself it really is. 'On Translating Homer' (1861) Lecture
2

He \[the translator\] will find one English book and one only, where, as
in the Iliad itself, perfect plainness of speech is allied with perfect
nobleness; and that book is the Bible. 'On Translating Homer' (1861)
Lecture 3

Nothing has raised more questioning among my critics than these
words---noble, the grand style....I think it will be found that the
grand style arises in poetry, when a noble nature, poetically gifted,
treats with simplicity or with severity a serious subject. 'On
Translating Homer' 'Last Words' (1862)

People think that I can teach them style. What stuff it all is! Have
something to say, and say it as clearly as you can. That is the only
secret of style. In G. W. E. Russell 'Collections and Recollections'

was easy to understand; He knew human folly like the back of his hand,
And was greatly interested in armies and fleets; When he laughed,
respectable senators burst with laughter, And when he cried the little
children died in the streets. 'Epitaph on a Tyrant' (1940).

Altogether elsewhere, vast Herds of reindeer move across Miles and miles
of golden moss, Silently and very fast. 'The Fall of Rome' (1951)

To us he is no more a person Now but a whole climate of opinion. 'In
Memory of Sigmund Freud' (1940)

He disappeared in the dead of winter: The brooks were frozen, the
airports almost deserted, And snow disfigured the public statues; The
mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day. What instruments we have
agree The day of his death was a dark cold day.

'In Memory of W. B. Yeats' (1940)

You were silly like us: your gift survived it all; The parish of rich
women, physical decay, Yourself; mad Ireland hurt you into poetry. Now
Ireland has her madness and her weather still, For poetry makes nothing
happen: it survives In the valley of its saying where executives Would
never want to tamper; it flows south From ranches of isolation and the
busy griefs, Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives, A way of
happening, a mouth. 'In Memory of W. B. Yeats' (1940)

Earth, receive an honoured guest; William Yeats is laid to rest: Let the
Irish vessel lie Emptied of its poetry. 'In Memory of W. B. Yeats'
(1940)

In the nightmare of the dark All the dogs of Europe bark, And the living
nations wait, Each sequestered in its hate; Intellectual disgrace Stares
from every human face, And the seas of pity lie Locked and frozen in
each eye. 'In Memory of W. B. Yeats' (1940)

In the deserts of the heart Let the healing fountain start, In the
prison of his days Teach the free man how to praise. 'In Memory of W. B.
Yeats' (1940)

There is no love; There are only the various envies, all of them sad.
'In Praise of Limestone' (1951) l. 58

This land is not the sweet home that it looks, Nor its peace the
historical calm of a site Where something was settled once and for all:
A backward And dilapidated province, connected To the big busy world by
a tunnel, with a certain Seedy appeal.

'In Praise of Limestone' (1951) l. 61

The desires of the heart are as crooked as corkscrews Not to be born is
the best for man The second best is a formal order The dance's pattern,
dance while you can. Dance, dance, for the figure is easy The tune is
catching and will not stop Dance till the stars come down with the
rafters Dance, dance, dance till you drop. 'Letter to William
Coldstream, Esq.' (1937).

And make us as Newton was, who in his garden watching The apple falling

Look, stranger, at this island now The leaping light for your delight

O what is that sound which so thrills the ear Down in the valley

About suffering they were never wrong, The Old Masters: how well they
understood Its human position; how it takes place While someone else is
eating or opening a window or just walking dully along. 'Musèe des Beaux
Arts' (1940)

They never forgot That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course
Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot Where the dogs go on with their
doggy life and the torturer's horse Scratches its innocent behind on a
tree. 'Musèe des Beaux Arts' (1940)

I see it often since you've been away: The island, the veranda, and the
fruit; The tiny steamer breaking from the bay; The literary mornings
with its hoot; Our ugly comic servant; and then you, Lovely and willing
every afternoon. 'New Verse' October 1933, p. 15

At the far end of the enormous room An orchestra is playing to the rich.
'New Verse' October 1933, p. 15

To the man-in-the-street, who, I'm sorry to say, Is a keen observer of
life, The word 'Intellectual' suggests straight away A man who's untrue
to his wife. 'New Year Letter' (1941) note to l. 1277

This is the Night Mail crossing the Border, Bringing the cheque and the
postal order, Letters for the rich, letters for the poor, The shop at
the corner, the girl next door.

Pulling up Beattock, a steady climb: The gradient's against her, but
she's on time. Past cotton-grass and moorland border, Shovelling white
steam over her shoulder. 'Night Mail' (1936)

Letters of thanks, letters from banks, Letters of joy from girl and boy,
Receipted bills and invitations To inspect new stock or to visit
relations, And applications for situations, And timid lovers'
declarations, And gossip, gossip from all the nations. 'Night Mail'

I and the public know What all schoolchildren learn, Those to whom evil
is done Do evil in return. 'September 1, 1939' (1940)

All I have is a voice To undo the folded lie, The romantic lie in the
brain Of the sensual man-in-the-street And the lie of Authority Whose
buildings grope the sky: There is no such thing as the State And no one
exists alone; Hunger allows no choice

To the citizen or the police; We must love one another or die.
'September 1, 1939' (1940)

Out of the air a voice without a face Proved by statistics that some

Sir, no man's enemy, forgiving all But will his negative inversion, be
prodigal: Send to us power and light, a sovereign touch Curing the
intolerable neutral itch, The exhaustion of weaning, the liar's quinsy,
And the distortions of ingrown virginity. 'Sir, No Man's Enemy' (1955)

Harrow the house of the dead; look shining at New styles of

Tomorrow for the young the poets exploding like bombs, The walks by the

The stars are dead. The animals will not look: We are left alone with
our day, and the time is short, and History to the defeated May say Alas

In a garden shady this holy lady With reverent cadence and subtle psalm,
Like a black swan as death came on Poured forth her song in perfect
calm: And by ocean's margin this innocent virgin Constructed an organ to
enlarge her prayer, And notes tremendous from her great engine Thundered
out on the Roman air. Blonde Aphrodite rose up excited, Moved to delight
by the melody, White as an orchid she rode quite naked In an oyster
shell on top of the sea. 'Three Songs for St Cecilia's Day' (1941); set

Let us honour if we can The vertical man Though we value none But the

Our researchers into Public Opinion are content That he held the proper
opinions for the time of year; When there was peace, he was for peace;
when there was war, he went. 'The Unknown Citizen' (1940)

Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd: Had anything been

The sky is darkening like a stain; Something is going to fall like rain,

Man is a history-making creature who can neither repeat his past nor
leave it behind. 'The Dyer's Hand' (1963) 'D. H. Lawrence'

The true men of action in our time, those who transform the world, are
not the politicians and statesmen, but the scientists. Unfortunately
poetry cannot celebrate them, because their deeds are concerned with
things, not persons, and are, therefore, speechless. When I find myself
in the company of scientists, I feel like a shabby curate who has
strayed by mistake into a drawing room full of dukes. 'The Dyer's Hand'

The folly of allowing people to be comfortable at home---and the folly
of people's not staying comfortable at home when they can!...five dull
hours in another man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was
not said and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again
tomorrow.... four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to
convey five idle, shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse

Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how. It is part of

Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery. I quit such odious subjects as
soon as I can. 'Mansfield Park' (1814) ch. 48

He feared that principle, active principle, had been wanting, that they
had never been properly taught to govern their inclinations and tempers,
by that sense of duty which can alone suffice. They had been instructed
theoretically in their religion, but never required to bring it into
daily practice. 'Mansfield Park' (1814) ch. 48 (of Sir Thomas Bertram)

'Oh! it is only a novel!...only Cecilia, or Camilla, or Belinda:' or, in

language. 'Northanger Abbey' (1818) ch. 5

Real solemn history, I cannot be interested in....The quarrels of popes
and kings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good
for nothing, and hardly any women at all. 'Northanger Abbey' (1818)
ch. 14 (Catherine Morland)

Where people wish to attach, they should always be ignorant. To come
with a well-informed mind, is to come with an inability of administering
to the vanity of others, which a sensible person would always wish to
avoid. A woman especially, if she have the misfortune of knowing any
thing, should conceal it as well as she can. 'Northanger Abbey' (1818)
ch. 14

From politics, it was an easy step to silence. 'Northanger Abbey' (1818)
ch. 14

Remember the country and the age we live in. Remember that we are
English, that we are Christians....Does our education prepare us for
such atrocities? Do our laws connive at them? Could they be perpetrated
without being known, in a country like this, where social and literary
intercourse is on such a footing; where every man is surrounded by a
neighbourhood of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay
every thing open?

'Northanger Abbey' (1818) ch. 34 (Henry Tilney)

Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch-hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,

She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as

She ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry; and to say,
that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry, to be seldom safely
enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings
while alone could estimate it truly, were the very feelings which ought
to taste it but sparingly. 'Persuasion' (1818) ch. 11

'My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,
well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is
what I call good company.' 'You are mistaken,' said he gently, 'that is
not good company, that is the best.' 'Persuasion' (1818) ch. 16 (Anne

Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education

1.122 A. J. Ayer (Sir Alfred Jules Ayer) 1910-89 The criterion which we
use to test the genuineness of apparent statements of fact is the
criterion of verifiability. We say that a sentence is factually
significant to any given person, if, and only if, he knows how to verify
the proposition which it purports to express---that is, if he knows what
observations would lead him, under certain conditions, to accept the
proposition as being true, or reject it as being false. 'Language,
Truth, and Logic' (2nd ed., 1946) p. 35

If I...say 'Stealing money is wrong,' I produce a sentence which has no
factual meaning---that is, expresses no proposition which can be either
true or false. It is as if I had written 'Stealing money!!'---where the
shape and thickness of the exclamation marks show, by a suitable
convention, that a special sort of moral disapproval is the feeling
which is being expressed. 'Language, Truth, and Logic' (2nd ed., 1946)
p. 107

\[We\] offer the theist the same comfort as we gave to the moralist. His
assertions cannot possibly be valid, but they cannot be invalid either.
As he says nothing at all about the world, he cannot justly be accused
of saying anything false, or anything for which he has insufficient
grounds. It is only when the theist claims that in asserting the
existence of a transcendent god he is expressing a genuine proposition
that we are entitled to disagree with him. 'Language, Truth, and Logic'

So let great authors have their due, as time, which is the author of
authors, be not deprived of his due, which is further and further to
discover truth. 'The Advancement of Learning' (1605) bk. 1, ch. 4, sect.

If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he
will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties. 'The

\[Knowledge is\] a rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator and the
relief of man's estate. 'The Advancement of Learning' (1605) bk. 1,

Antiquities are history defaced, or some remnants of history which have
casually escaped the shipwreck of time. 'The Advancement of Learning'
(1605) bk. 2, ch. 2, sect. 1

Poesy was ever thought to have some participation of divineness, because
it doth raise and erect the mind, by submitting the shows of things to
the desires of the mind; whereas reason doth buckle and bow the mind
unto the nature of things. 'The Advancement of Learning' (1605) bk. 2,
ch. 4, sect. 2

The knowledge of man is as the waters, some descending from above, and
some springing from beneath; the one informed by the light of nature,
the other inspired by divine revelation. 'The Advancement of Learning'

But men must know, that in this theatre of man's life it is reserved
only for God and angels to be lookers on. 'The Advancement of Learning'

Did not one of the fathers in great indignation call poesy vinum
daemonum? 'The Advancement of Learning' (1605) bk. 2, ch. 22, sect. 13

All good moral philosophy is but an handmaid to religion. 'The
Advancement of Learning' (1605) bk. 2, ch. 22, sect. 14

It is in life as it is in ways, the shortest way is commonly the
foulest, and surely the fairer way is not much about. 'The Advancement

That all things are changed, and that nothing really perishes, and that
the sum of matter remains exactly the same, is sufficiently certain.

Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament, adversity is the
blessing of the New. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Adversity'

The pencil of the Holy Ghost hath laboured more in describing the
afflictions of Job than the felicities of Solomon. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of
Adversity'

Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes; and adversity is not
without comforts and hopes. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Adversity'

Prosperity doth best discover vice, but adversity doth best discover
virtue. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Adversity'

I had rather believe all the fables in the legend, and the Talmud, and
the Alcoran, than that this universal frame is without a mind. 'Essays'
(1625) 'Of Atheism'

A little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in
philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of
Atheism'

They that deny a God destroy man's nobility; for certainly man is of kin
to the beasts by his body; and, if he be not of kin to God by his
spirit, he is a base and ignoble creature. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Atheism'

Virtue is like a rich stone, best plain set. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Beauty'

That is the best part of beauty, which a picture cannot express.
'Essays' (1625) 'Of Beauty'

There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the
proportion. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Beauty'

He said it that knew it best. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Boldness' (referring

In civil business; what first? boldness; what second and third?
boldness: and yet boldness is a child of ignorance and baseness.

'Essays' (1625) 'Of Boldness'.

Boldness is an ill keeper of promise. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Boldness'

Houses are built to live in and not to look on; therefore let use be

Books will speak plain when counsellors blanch. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of
Counsel'

There be that can pack the cards and yet cannot play well; so there are
some that are good in canvasses and factions, that are otherwise weak
men. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Cunning'

In things that are tender and unpleasing, it is good to break the ice by
some whose words are of less weight, and to reserve the more weighty
voice to come in as by chance. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Cunning'

I knew one that when he wrote a letter he would put that which was most
material in the postscript, as if it had been a bymatter. 'Essays'
(1625) 'Of Cunning'

Nothing doth more hurt in a state than that cunning men pass for wise.
'Essays' (1625) 'Of Cunning'

Men fear death as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural
fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other. 'Essays'
(1625) 'Of Death'

There is no passion in the mind of man so weak, but it mates and masters
the fear of death. And therefore death is no such terrible enemy, when a
man hath so many attendants about him that can win the combat of him.
Revenge triumphs over death; love slights it; honour aspireth to it;
grief flieth to it. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Death'

It is as natural to die as to be born; and to a little infant, perhaps,
the one is as painful as the other. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Death'

Above all, believe it, the sweetest canticle is Nunc dimittis, when a
man hath obtained worthy ends and expectations. Death hath this also,
that it openeth the gate to good fame, and extinguisheth envy. 'Essays'

If you dissemble sometimes your knowledge of that you are thought to

There is little friendship in the world, and least of all between
equals. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Followers and Friends'

Chiefly the mould of a man's fortune is in his own hands. 'Essays'
(1625) 'Of Fortune'

If a man look sharply, and attentively, he shall see Fortune: for though
she be blind, yet she is not invisible. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Fortune'

It had been hard for him that spake it to have put more truth and
untruth together, in a few words, than in that speech: 'Whosoever is
delighted in solitude is either a wild beast, or a god.' 'Essays' (1625)
'Of Friendship'.

A crowd is not company, and faces are but a gallery of pictures, and
talk but a tinkling cymbal, where there is no love. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of
Friendship'

It redoubleth joys, and cutteth griefs in halves. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of
Friendship'

As if you would call a physician, that is thought good for the cure of
the disease you complain of but is unacquainted with your body, and
therefore may put you in the way for a present cure but overthroweth
your health in some other kind; and so cure the disease and kill the
patient. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Friendship'

God Almighty first planted a garden; and, indeed, it is the purest of
human pleasures. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Gardens'

The inclination to goodness is imprinted deeply in the nature of man:
insomuch, that if it issue not towards men, it will take unto other
living creatures. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Goodness, and Goodness of Nature'

If a man be gracious and courteous to strangers, it shows he is a
citizen of the world. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Goodness, and Goodness of
Nature'

Men in great place are thrice servants: servants of the sovereign or
state, servants of fame, and servants of business.

'Essays' (1625) 'Of Great Place'

It is a strange desire to seek power and to lose liberty. 'Essays'
(1625) 'Of Great Place'

The rising unto place is laborious, and by pains men come to greater
pains; and it is sometimes base, and by indignities men come to
dignities. The standing is slippery, and the regress is either a
downfall, or at least an eclipse. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Great Place'

Severity breedeth fear, but roughness breedeth hate. Even reproofs from
authority ought to be grave, and not taunting. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Great
Place'

All rising to great place is by a winding stair. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of
Great Place'

As the births of living creatures at first are ill-shapen, so are all
innovations, which are the births of time. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of

It has been well said that 'the arch-flatterer with whom all the petty
flatterers have intelligence is a man's self.' 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Love'

He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune; for they
are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief.
'Essays' (1625) 'Of Marriage and the Single Life'.

A single life doth well with churchmen, for charity will hardly water
the ground where it must first fill a pool. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Marriage
and the Single Life'

Wives are young men's mistresses, companions for middle age, and old
men's nurses. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Marriage and the Single Life'

He was reputed one of the wise men that made answer to the question when
a man should marry? 'A young man not yet, an elder man not at all.'

Revenge is a kind of wild justice, which the more man's nature runs to,
the more ought law to weed it out. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Revenge'

A man that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green. 'Essays' (1625)
'Of Revenge'

Defer not charities till death; for certainly, if a man weigh it
rightly, he that doth so is rather liberal of another man's than of his

The four pillars of government...(which are religion, justice, counsel,
and treasure). 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Seditions and Troubles'

The surest way to prevent seditions (if the times do bear it) is to take

Money is like muck, not good except it be spread. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of
Seditions and Troubles'

They perfect nature and are perfected by experience. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of

Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted,
nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider. 'Essays'
(1625) 'Of Studies'

Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be
chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read only in parts;
others to be read but not curiously; and some few

to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention. Some books also may
be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by others. 'Essays' (1625)
'Of Studies'

Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact
man. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Studies'

Histories make men wise; poets, witty; the mathematics, subtile; natural
philosophy, deep; moral, grave; logic and rhetoric, able to contend.
'Essays' (1625) 'Of Studies'

There is a superstition in avoiding superstition. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of

Suspicions amongst thoughts are like bats amongst birds, they ever fly

Travel, in the younger sort, is a part of education; in the elder, a

some entrance into the language, goeth to school, and not to travel.

What is truth? said jesting Pilate; and would not stay for an answer.
'Essays' (1625) 'Of Truth'.

A mixture of a lie doth ever add pleasure. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Truth'

It is not the lie that passeth through the mind, but the lie that
sinketh in, and settleth in it, that doth the hurt. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of
Truth'

The inquiry of truth, which is the love-making, or wooing of it, the
knowledge of truth, which is the presence of it, and the belief of
truth, which is the enjoying of it, is the sovereign good of human
nature. 'Essays' (1625) 'Of Truth'

In the youth of a state arms do flourish; in the middle age of a state,

It is the wisdom of the crocodiles, that shed tears when they would

For they thought generally that he was a Prince as ordained, and sent
down from heaven to unite and put to an end the long dissensions of the
two houses; which although they had had, in the times of Henry the
Fourth, Henry the Fifth, and a part of Henry the Sixth on the one side,
and the times of Edward the Fourth on the other, lucid intervals and
happy pauses; yet they did ever hang over the kingdom, ready to break

Haec enim tria rerum faciem et statum in orbe terrarum mutaverunt. It is
well to observe the force and virtue and consequence of discoveries, and
these are to be seen nowhere more conspicuously than in those three
which were unknown to the ancients, and of which the origin, though
recent, is obscure and inglorious; namely, printing, gunpowder and the
magnet \[Mariner's Needle\]. For these three have changed the whole face
and state of things throughout the world. 'Novum Organum' (1620) bk. 1,

The mystic reverence, the religious allegiance, which are essential to a
true monarchy, are imaginative sentiments that no legislature can
manufacture in any people. 'The English Constitution' (1867) 'The
Cabinet'

In such constitutions \[as England's\] there are two parts...first,
those which excite and preserve the reverence of the population---the
dignified parts...and next, the efficient parts---those by which it, in
fact, works and rules. 'The English Constitution' (1867) 'The Cabinet'

No orator ever made an impression by appealing to men as to their
plainest physical wants, except when he could allege that those wants
were caused by some one's tyranny. 'The English Constitution' (1867)
'The Cabinet'

The Crown is according to the saying, the 'fountain of honour'; but the
Treasury is the spring of business. 'The English Constitution' (1867)
'The Cabinet'.

A cabinet is a combining committee---a hyphen which joins, a buckle
which fastens, the legislative part of the state to the executive part
of the state. 'The English Constitution' (1867) 'The Cabinet'

It has been said that England invented the phrase, 'Her Majesty's
Opposition'; that it was the first government which made a criticism of
administration as much a part of the polity as administration itself.
This critical opposition is the consequence of cabinet government. 'The

The Times has made many ministries. 'The English Constitution' (1867)

The great qualities, the imperious will, the rapid energy, the eager
nature fit for a great crisis are not required---are impediments---in
common times. A Lord Liverpool is better in everyday politics than a
Chatham---a Louis Philippe far better than a Napoleon. 'The English
Constitution' (1867) 'The Cabinet'

The soldier---that is, the great soldier---of to-day is not a romantic
animal, dashing at forlorn hopes, animated by frantic sentiment, full of
fancies as to a love-lady or a sovereign; but a quiet, grave man, busied
in charts, exact in sums, master of the art of tactics, occupied in
trivial detail; thinking, as the Duke of Wellington was said to do, most
of the shoes of his soldiers; despising all manner of èclat and
eloquence; perhaps, like Count Moltke, 'silent in seven languages'. 'The
English Constitution' (1867) 'Checks and Balances'

The order of nobility is of great use, too, not only in what it creates,
but in what it prevents. It prevents the rule of wealth---the religion
of gold. This is the obvious and natural idol of the Anglo-Saxon. 'The
English Constitution' (1867) 'The House of Lords'

A severe though not unfriendly critic of our institutions said that 'the

Nations touch at their summits. 'The English Constitution' (1867) 'The

The best reason why Monarchy is a strong government is, that it is an
intelligible government. The mass of mankind understand it, and they
hardly anywhere in the world understand any other. 'The English

The characteristic of the English Monarchy is that it retains the
feelings by which the heroic kings governed their rude age, and has
added the feelings by which the constitutions of later Greece ruled in
more refined ages. 'The English Constitution' (1867) 'The Monarchy'

Women---one half the human race at least---care fifty times more for a
marriage than a ministry. 'The English Constitution' (1867) 'The

Royalty is a government in which the attention of the nation is
concentrated on one person doing interesting actions. A Republic is a
government in which that attention is divided between

many, who are all doing uninteresting actions. Accordingly, so long as
the human heart is strong and the human reason weak, Royalty will be
strong because it appeals to diffused feeling, and Republics weak
because they appeal to the understanding. 'The English Constitution'
(1867) 'The Monarchy'

2.111 Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg 1856-1921 Just for a word
'neutrality'---a word which in wartime has so often been
disregarded---just for a scrap of paper, Great Britain is going to make
war on a kindred nation who desires nothing better than to be friends

2.112 Sir John Betjeman 1906-84 He sipped at a weak hock and seltzer As
he gazed at the London skies Through the Nottingham lace of the curtains

Or was it his bees-winged eyes? He rose, and he put down The Yellow
Book. He staggered---and, terrible-eyed, He brushed past the palms on
the staircase And was helped to a hansom outside. 'The Arrest of Oscar
Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel' (1937)

And girls in slacks remember Dad, And oafish louts remember Mum, And
sleepless children's hearts are glad, And Christmas-morning bells say
'Come!' Even to shining ones who dwell Safe in the Dorchester Hotel. And
is it true? And is it true, This most tremendous tale of all, Seen in a
stained-glass window's hue, A Baby in an ox's stall? The Maker of the
stars and sea Become a Child on earth for me? 'Christmas' (1954)

Oh shall I see the Thames again? The prow-promoted gems again, As beefy

Come shooting through the bridge? And 'cheerioh' or 'cheeri-bye' Across

In the licorice fields at Pontefract My love and I did meet And many a
burdened licorice bush Was blooming round our feet; Red hair she had and

Belbroughton Road is bonny, and pinkly bursts the spray Of prunus and
forsythia across the public way, For a full spring-tide of blossom
seethed and departed hence, Leaving land-locked pools of jonquils by
sunny garden fence. And a constant sound of flushing runneth from
windows where The toothbrush too is airing in this new North Oxford air.

Gaily into Ruislip Gardens Runs the red electric train, With a thousand

Middlesex again. 'Middlesex' (1954)

the grace of a boy, With carefullest carelessness, gaily you won, I am

warm-handled racket is back in its press, But my shock-headed victor,
she loves me no less. 'A Subaltern's Love-Song' (1945)

By roads 'not adopted', by woodlanded ways, She drove to the club in the
late summer haze, Into nine-o'clock Camberley, heavy with bells And
mushroomy, pine-woody, evergreen smells. Miss Joan Hunter Dunn, Miss

Michael Foot 'Aneurin Bevan' (1962) vol. 1, ch. 8

I know that the right kind of leader for the Labour Party is a
desiccated calculating machine who must not in any way permit himself to
be swayed by indignation. If he sees suffering, privation or injustice
he must not allow it to move him, for that would be evidence of the lack
of proper education or of absence of self-control. He must speak in calm
and objective accents and talk about a dying child in the same way as he
would about the pieces inside an internal combustion engine. In Michael
Foot 'Aneurin Bevan' (1973) vol. 2, ch. 11

I hope you will carry no resolution of an emergency character telling a

thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; And

commandments. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain;

God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy

stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the Lord made heaven

father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the
Lord thy God giveth thee.

steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. Thou

come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no
pleasure in them; While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the
stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: In the day

her. 1 Corinthians ch. 11, v. 14

Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 1 Corinthians
ch. 12, v. 4

Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not
charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though
I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all
knowledge; and though I have all faith; so that I could remove
mountains; and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all
my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and
have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and
is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed
up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily
provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in
the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
endureth all things. Charity never faileth: but whether there be
prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues; they shall cease;
whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part,
and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then
that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as
a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I
became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a
glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall
I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, charity,
these three; but the greatest of these is charity. 1 Corinthians ch. 13,
v. 1

If the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the
battle? 1 Corinthians ch. 14, v. 8

Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted
unto them to speak. 1 Corinthians ch. 14, v. 34

If they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for
it is a shame for women to speak in the church. 1 Corinthians ch. 14, v.
35

Let all things be done decently and in order. 1 Corinthians ch. 14, v.
40

Last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.

For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an
apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God
I am what I am. 1 Corinthians ch. 15, v. 8

I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of
God which was with me. 1 Corinthians ch. 15, v. 10

If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
miserable. 1 Corinthians ch. 15, v. 19

But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of
them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the
resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ
shall all be made alive. 1 Corinthians ch. 15, v. 20

The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. 1 Corinthians ch. 15,
v. 26

If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what
advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to
morrow we die. 1 Corinthians ch. 15, v. 32.

Evil communications corrupt good manners. 1 Corinthians ch. 15, v. 33

One star differeth from another star in glory. 1 Corinthians ch. 15, v.
41

So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is
raised in incorruption. 1 Corinthians ch. 15, v. 42

The first man is of the earth, earthy. 1 Corinthians ch. 15, v. 47

Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump;
for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption,
and this mortal must put on immortality. 1 Corinthians ch. 15, v. 51

O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? 1
Corinthians ch. 15, v. 55

Quit you like men, be strong. 1 Corinthians ch. 16, v. 13

Let him be Anathema Maran-atha 1 Corinthians ch. 16, v. 22

fool) I am more. 2 Corinthians ch. 11, v. 22

Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I
beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a
night and a day have I been in the deep; In journeyings often, in perils
of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in
perils by the heathen, in perils of the city, in perils in the
wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; In
weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in
fastings often, in cold and nakedness. Beside those things that are
without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
2 Corinthians ch. 11, v. 24

I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy
of the vocation wherewith ye are called. Ephesians ch. 4, v. 1

He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and
some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the
work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we
all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness
of Christ:

That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried
about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning
craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. Ephesians ch. 4, v. 11

We are members one of another. Ephesians ch. 4, v. 25

whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day,
and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt
about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And
your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all,
taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the
fiery darts of the wicked. Ephesians ch. 6, v. 12

2.116.4.11 Philippians

Philippians ch. 1, v. 23

Majesty on high. Hebrews ch. 1, v. 1

easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set
before us, Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who
for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the
shame, and is set down at the right hand of God.

Be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: For the wrath of man
worketh not the righteousness of God. Wherefore lay apart all filthiness
and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted
word, which is able to save your souls, But be ye doers of the word, and
not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a hearer of
the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural
face in a glass: For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and
straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. James ch. 1, v. 19

If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue,
but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain. Pure religion

world. James ch. 1, v. 26

shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of
God in him? 1 John ch. 3, v. 17

And did those feet in ancient time Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy Lamb of God On England's pleasant pastures seen? And
did the Countenance Divine Shine forth upon our clouded hills? And was
Jerusalem builded here Among these dark Satanic mills? Bring me my bow
of burning gold: Bring me my arrows of desire: Bring me my spear: O
clouds, unfold! Bring me my chariot of fire. I will not cease from
mental fight, Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand, Till we have built
Jerusalem, In England's green and pleasant land. 'Milton' (1804-10)

shrouded in snow: Arise from their graves and aspire, Where my
Sun-flower wishes to go. 'Songs of Experience' (1794) 'Ah, Sun-flower!'

Should we miss but a tree where we used to be playing, Or find the wood
cut where we sauntered a-Maying,--- If the yew-seat's away, or the ivy's

a schoolboy who wipes his fingers on a slate after spitting on
them...These are not works of art at all, unless throwing a handful of

flying, In large white flakes falling on the city brown, Stealthily and

All night it fell, and when full inches seven It lay in the depth of its
uncompacted lightness, The clouds blew off from a high and frosty
heaven; And all woke earlier for the unaccustomed brightness Of the
winter dawning, the strange unheavenly glare. 'London Snow' (1890)

So sweet love seemed that April morn, When first we kissed beside the
thorn, So strangely sweet, it was not strange We thought that love could
never change. But I can tell---let truth be told--- That love will
change in growing old; Though day by day is nought to see, So delicate
his motions be. 'So sweet love seemed' (1894)

2.201 Charlotte Brontë 1816-55 We wore a web in childhood, A web of
sunny air; We dug a spring in infancy Of water pure and fair; We sowed
in youth a mustard seed, We cut an almond rod; We are now grown up to
riper age--- Are they withered in the sod? '19 December 1835'

Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To
attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from the
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
Thorns. 'Jane Eyre' (2nd ed., 1848) preface

Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men
feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their
efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a
restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer...it
is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do
more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex. 'Jane Eyre'
(1847) ch. 12

As his curate, his comrade, all would be right...There would be recesses
in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came; and
sentiments growing there, fresh and sheltered, which his austerity could
never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down. But as his
wife...forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry...this would be unendurable.
'Jane Eyre' (1847) ch. 34

No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere: I see Heaven's glories
shine, And faith shines equal, arming me from fear. 'Last Lines'

Though earth and moon were gone And suns and universes ceased to be And
thou wert left alone Every existence would exist in thee. 'Last Lines'

Oh! dreadful is the check---intense the agony--- When the ear begins to
hear, and the eye begins to see; When the pulse begins to throb, the
brain to think again; The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel
the chain. 'The Prisoner'

Cold in the earth---and fifteen wild Decembers, From those brown hills,
have melted into spring. 'Remembrance' (1846)

Sweet Love of youth, forgive, if I forget thee, While the world's tide
is bearing me along; Other desires and other hopes beset me, Hopes which
obscure, but cannot do thee wrong! 'Remembrance' (1846)

But when the days of golden dreams had perished, And even Despair was
powerless to destroy, Then did I learn how existence could be cherished,
Strengthened, and fed without the aid of joy. 'Remembrance' (1846)

If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be;
and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would
turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it. My love for
Linton is like the foliage in the woods; time will change it, I'm well
aware, as winter changes the trees---My love for Heathcliff resembles
the eternal rocks beneath:---a source of little visible delight, but
necessary. 'Wuthering Heights' (1847) ch. 9

I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths
fluttering among the heath and hare-bells; listened to the soft wind
breathing through the grass; and wondered how any one could ever imagine
unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth. 'Wuthering
Heights' (1847) closing words

2.205 Rupert Brooke 1887-1915 Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!
There's none of these so lonely and poor of old, But, dying, has made us
rarer gifts than gold. These laid the world away; poured out the red
Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be Of work and joy, and that
unhoped serene, That men call age; and those that would have been, Their
sons, they gave, their immortality. 'The Dead' (1914)

Honour has come back, as a king, to earth, And paid his subjects with a
royal wage; And Nobleness walks in our ways again; And we have come into
our heritage. 'The Dead' (1914)

The cool kindliness of sheets, that soon Smooth away trouble; and the
rough male kiss Of blankets. 'The Great Lover' (1914)

Fish say, they have their stream and pond; But is there anything beyond?
'Heaven' (1915)

One may not doubt that, somehow, good Shall come of water and of mud;
And sure, the reverent eye must see A purpose in liquidity. 'Heaven'
(1915)

Fat caterpillars drift around, And Paradisal grubs are found; Unfading
moths, immortal flies, And the worm that never dies.

And in that Heaven of all their wish, There shall be no more land, say
fish. 'Heaven' (1915)

Just now the lilac is in bloom, All before my little room. 'The Old
Vicarage, Grantchester' (1915)

Unkempt about those hedges blows An English unofficial rose. 'The Old
Vicarage, Grantchester' (1915)

Curates, long dust, will come and go On lissom, clerical, printless toe;
And oft between the boughs is seen The sly shade of a Rural Dean. 'The
Old Vicarage, Grantchester' (1915)

God! I will pack, and take a train, And get me to England once again!
For England's the one land, I know, Where men with Splendid Hearts may
go. 'The Old Vicarage, Grantchester' (1915)

For Cambridge people rarely smile, Being urban, squat, and packed with
guile. 'The Old Vicarage, Grantchester' (1915)

They love the Good; they worship Truth; They laugh uproariously in
youth; (And when they get to feeling old, They up and shoot themselves,
I'm told). 'The Old Vicarage, Grantchester' (1915)

Stands the Church clock at ten to three? And is there honey still for
tea? 'The Old Vicarage, Grantchester' (1915)

Now, God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour, And caught our
youth, and wakened us from sleeping, With hand made sure, clear eye, and
sharpened power, To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping. 'Peace'
(1914)

Naught broken save this body, lost but breath; Nothing to shake the
laughing heart's long peace there But only agony, and that has ending;
And the worst friend and enemy is but Death. 'Peace' (1914)

If I should die, think only this of me: That there's some corner of a
foreign field That is for ever England. There shall be In that rich
earth a richer dust concealed; A dust whom England bore, shaped, made
aware, Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam, A body of
England's, breathing English air, Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of
home. And think, this heart, all evil shed away, A pulse in the eternal
mind, no less Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given; Her
sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day; And laughter, learnt of
friends; and gentleness, In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.
'The Soldier' (1914)

2.206 Anita Brookner 1938--- And what is the most potent myth of
all?...The tortoise and the hare...In real life, of course, it is the
hare who wins. Every time...You could argue that the hare might be
affected by the tortoise lobby's propaganda, might become more prudent,
circumspect, slower, in fact. But the hare is always convinced of his
own superiority; he simply does not recognize the tortoise as a worthy
adversary. That is why the hare wins. 'Hotel du Lac' (1984) ch. 2

Nor will the sweetest delight of gardens afford much comfort in sleep;
wherein the dullness of that sense shakes hands with delectable odours;
and though in the bed of Cleopatra, can hardly with any delight raise up
the ghost of a rose. 'The Garden of Cyrus' (1658) ch. 5

Though Somnus in Homer be sent to rouse up Agamemnon, I find no such
effects in these drowsy approaches of sleep. To keep our eyes open
longer were but to act our Antipodes. The huntsmen are up in America,
and they are already past their first sleep in Persia. But who can be
drowsy at that hour which freed us from everlasting sleep? or have
slumbering thoughts at that time, when sleep itself must end, and as
some conjecture all shall awake again? 'The Garden of Cyrus' (1658)

forced to surrender. 'Religio Medici' (1643) pt. 1, sect. 6

As for those wingy mysteries in divinity and airy subtleties in
religion, which have unhinged the brains of better heads, they never
stretched the pia mater of mine; methinks there be not impossibilities
enough in religion for an active faith. 'Religio Medici' (1643) pt. 1,
sect. 9

I love to lose myself in a mystery, to pursue my reason to an O
altitudo! 'Religio Medici' (1643) pt. 1, sect. 9

Who can speak of eternity without a solecism, or think thereof without
an ecstasy? Time we may comprehend, 'tis but five days elder than
ourselves. 'Religio Medici' (1643) pt. 1, sect. 11

I have often admired the mystical way of Pythagoras, and the secret

weeds and tares of mine own brain. 'Religio Medici' (1643) pt. 1, sect.

I am not so much afraid of death, as ashamed thereof; 'tis the very
disgrace and ignominy of our natures, that in a moment can so disfigure
us that our nearest friends, wife, and children,

stand afraid and start at us. 'Religio Medici' (1643) pt. 1, sect. 40

in the optics of these eyes to behold felicity; the first day of our

everywhere, and under any meridian. 'Religio Medici' (1643) pt. 2, sect.

If there be any among those common objects of hatred I do condemn and
laugh at, it is that great enemy of reason, virtue and religion, the
multitude, that numerous piece of monstrosity, which taken asunder seem
men, and the reasonable creatures of God; but confused together, make
but one great beast, and a monstrosity more prodigious than Hydra.
'Religio Medici' (1643) pt. 2, sect. 1

unworthy piece of folly he hath committed. 'Religio Medici' (1643)
pt. 2, sect. 9

Sure there is music even in the beauty, and the silent note which Cupid
strikes, far sweeter than the sound of an instrument. For there is music
wherever there is a harmony, order or proportion; and thus far we may

regular paces, though they give no sound unto the ear, yet to the
understanding they strike a note most full of harmony. 'Religio Medici'
(1643) pt. 2, sect. 9

Half our days we pass in the shadow of the earth; and the brother of
death exacteth a third part of our lives. S. Wilkin (ed.) 'Sir Thomas
Browne's Works' (1835) vol. 4, p. 355 'On Dreams'

on the earth Have learnt the simple dues of fellowship and social
comfort, in a hospital. 'Aurora Leigh' (1857) bk. 3, l. 1121

Nay, if there's room for poets in this world A little overgrown (I think
there is)

Their sole work is to represent the age, Their age, not Charlemagne's...
King Arthur's self Was commonplace to Lady Guenever; And Camelot to

the first similitude. 'Aurora Leigh' (1857) bk. 7, l. 821

I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless. 'Grief' (1844)

Deep-hearted man, express Grief for thy dead in silence like to death;

are not wet--- If it could weep, it could arise and go. 'Grief' (1844)

On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect round. 'Abt
Vogler' (1864) st. 9

The high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard, The

shall hear it by and by. 'Abt Vogler' (1864) st. 10

truth calls spade a spade! 'Aristophanes' Apology' (1875) l. 409

Don't you know, I promised, if you'd watch a dinner out,

soul free a little. 'Bishop Blougram's Apology' (1855) l. 15

Just when we are safest, there's a sunset-touch, A fancy from a
flower-bell, some one's death, A chorus-ending from Euripides,--- And
that's enough for fifty hopes and fears As old and new at once as
nature's self, To rap and knock and enter in our soul, Take hands and
dance there, a fantastic ring, Round the ancient idol, on his base
again,--- The grand Perhaps! 'Bishop Blougram's Apology' (1855) l. 182

All we have gained then by our unbelief Is a life of doubt diversified
by faith, For one of faith diversified by doubt: We called the
chess-board white,---we call it black. 'Bishop Blougram's Apology'
(1855) l. 209

Our interest's on the dangerous edge of things, The honest thief, the
tender murderer, The superstitious atheist, demirep That loves and saves
her soul in new French books--- We watch while these in equilibrium keep
The giddy line midway. 'Bishop Blougram's Apology' (1855) l. 395

ever. 'Reflections on the Revolution in France' (1790) p. 112

The unbought grace of life, the cheap defence of nations, the nurse of
manly sentiment and heroic enterprise is gone! It is gone, that
sensibility of principle, that chastity of honour, which felt a stain
like a wound, which inspired courage whilst it mitigated ferocity, which
ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice itself lost half its
evil, by losing all its grossness. 'Reflections on the Revolution in

The concessions of the weak are the concessions of fear. Speech 'On
Conciliation with America' 22 March 1775

When we speak of the commerce with our colonies, fiction lags after
truth; invention is unfruitful, and imagination cold and barren. Speech
'On Conciliation with America' 22 March 1775

The use of force alone is but temporary. It may subdue for a moment; but

Nothing less will content me, than whole America. Speech 'On

Deny them this participation of freedom, and you break that sole bond,
which originally made, and must still preserve the unity of the empire.
Speech 'On Conciliation with America' 22 March 1775

It is the love of the people; it is their attachment to their
government, from the sense of the deep stake they have in such a
glorious institution, which gives you your army and your navy, and
infuses into both that liberal obedience, without which your army would
be a base rabble, and your navy nothing but rotten timber. Speech 'On

the orang-outang or the tiger. Speech on Fox's East India Bill, 1
December 1783

Your governor stimulates a rapacious and licentious soldiery to the
personal search of women, lest these unhappy creatures should avail

'Thoughts and Details on Scarcity' (1800)

To complain of the age we live in, to murmur at the present possessors
of power, to lament the past, to conceive extravagant hopes of the
future, are the common dispositions of the greatest part of mankind.
'Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents' (1770) p. 4

I am not one of those who think that the people are never in the wrong.
They have been so, frequently and outrageously, both in other countries
and in this. But I do say, that in all disputes between them and their
rulers, the presumption is at least upon a par in favour of the people.

We must soften into a credulity below the milkiness of infancy to think

the Cause of the Present Discontents' (1770) p. 30

When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one
by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle. 'Thoughts on
the Cause of the Present Discontents' (1770) p. 71

Of this stamp is the cant of Not men, but measures; a sort of charm by
which many people get loose from every honourable engagement. 'Thoughts
on the Cause of the Present Discontents' (1770) p. 75

It is therefore our business carefully to cultivate in our minds, to
rear to the most perfect vigour and maturity, every sort of generous and
honest feeling that belongs to our nature. To bring the dispositions
that are lovely in private life into the service and conduct of the
commonwealth; so to be patriots, as not to forget we are gentlemen.

People crushed by law have no hopes but from power. If laws are their
enemies, they will be enemies to laws; and those, who have much to hope

eternity. 'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage' (1812-18) canto 4, st. 27

and, music in its roar: I love not man the less, but nature more, From

in girth, Of air-balloons, and of the many bars To perfect knowledge of
the boundless skies; And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes. 'Don
Juan' (1819-24) canto 1, st. 92

other---and, beholding this, Their lips drew near, and clung into a

from its high celestial flavour, Down to a very homely household savour.

deep, Voluptuous as the first approach of sleep. 'The Island' (1823)
canto 2, st. 7

Beside the jutting rock the few appeared, Like the last remnant of the
red-deer's herd; Their eyes were feverish, and their aspect worn, But
still the hunter's blood was on their horn, A little stream came
tumbling from the height, And straggling into ocean as it might, Its
bounding crystal frolicked in the ray, And gushed from cliff to crag
with saltless spray... To this young spring they rushed,---all feelings
first

Absorbed in passion's and in nature's thirst,--- Drank as they do who
drink their last, and threw Their arms aside to revel in its dew; Cooled
their scorched throats, and washed the gory stains From wounds whose
only bandage might be chains. 'The Island' (1823) canto 3, st. 3

itself! But we, who name ourselves its sovereigns, we, Half dust, half

conflict of its elements, and breathe The breath of degradation and of
pride. 'Manfred' (1817) act 1, sc. 2, l. 37

I linger yet with nature, for the night Hath been to me a more familiar

As he drew near, he gazed upon the gate Ne'er to be entered more by him
or Sin, With such a glance of supernatural hate, As made Saint Peter
wish himself within; He pattered with his keys at a great rate, And
sweated through his apostolic skin: Of course his perspiration was but
ichor, Or some such other spiritual liquor. 'The Vision of Judgement'

You well know how soon one of these stupendous masses, now reposing on

life and motion: how soon it would ruffle, as it were its swelling

collect its scattered elements of strength and waken its dormant
thunder...Such is England herself; while apparently passive and
motionless, she silently concentrates the power to be put forth on an
adequate occasion. Speech at Plymouth, 12 December 1823, referring to

breezes caress, the sun makes strong, and the rain brings out; many boys

Multas per gentes et multa per aequora vectus Advenio has miseras,
frater, ad inferias, Ut te postremo donarem munere mortis Et mutam
nequiquam alloquerer cinerem. Quandoquidem fortuna mihi tete abstulit
ipsum, Heu miser indigne frater adempte mihi, Nunc tamen interea haec
prisco quae more parentum Tradita sunt tristi munere ad inferias, Accipe
fraterno multum manantia fletu, Atque in perpetuum, frater, ave atque
vale. By many lands and over many a wave I come, my brother, to your
piteous grave, To bring you the last offering in death And o'er dumb
dust expend an idle breath; For fate has torn your living self from me,
And snatched you, brother, O, how cruelly! Yet take these gifts, brought
as our fathers bade For sorrow's tribute to the passing shade; A
brother's tears have wet them o'er and o'er; And so, my brother, hail,
and farewell evermore! 'Carmina' no. 101 (translated by Sir William
Marris)

But for the most part, women are not educated as they should be, I mean

(1650) p. 337

As to the King, the laws of the land will clearly instruct you for
that...For the people; and truly I desire their liberty and freedom, as
much as any body: but I must tell you, that their liberty and freedom
consists in having the government of those laws, by which their life and
their goods may be most their own; 'tis not for having share in
government \[sirs\] that is nothing pertaining to 'em. A subject and a
sovereign are clean different things...If I would have given way to an
arbitrary way, for to have all laws changed according to the power of
the sword, I needed not to have come here; and therefore I tell you (and
I pray God it be not laid to your charge) that I am the martyr of the
people. Speech on the scaffold, 30 January 1649. J. Rushworth

Putting moral virtues at the highest, and religion at the lowest,
religion must still be allowed to be a collateral security, at least, to
virtue; and every prudent man will sooner trust to two securities than

Knowledge may give weight, but accomplishments give lustre, and many
more people see than weigh. 'Letters to his Son' (1774) 8 May 1750

The loyalties which centre upon number one are enormous. If he trips he
must be sustained. If he makes mistakes they must be covered. If he
sleeps he must not be wantonly disturbed. If he is no good he must be

day; and certainly not in the days just after he has been chosen. 'The
Second World War' vol. 2 (1949) ch. 1

I can pay for the damage if ever so bad. So pleasant it is to have
money, heigho! So pleasant it is to have money. 'Dipsychus' (1865) sc. 5

breathing, A mighty fountain momently was forced. 'Kubla Khan' (1798)

It was a miracle of rare device, A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of
ice. 'Kubla Khan' (1798)

Beware! His flashing eyes, his floating hair! Weave a circle round him
thrice, And close your eyes with holy dread, For he on honey-dew hath
fed, And drunk the milk of Paradise. 'Kubla Khan' (1798)

more---the feeling that I could last for ever, outlast the sea, the
earth, and all men; the deceitful feeling that lures us on to joys, to
perils, to love, to vain effort---to death; the triumphant conviction of

view the lazy tide In its hot slimy channel slowly glide; Where the

the feelings these dull scenes produce, And loved to stop beside the
opening sluice; Where the small stream, confined in narrow bound, Ran
with a dull, unvaried, sad'ning sound;

grief, and fear. 'The Borough' (1810) Letter 22 'Peter Grimes' l. 185

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. 'O drug!' said I aloud,

If once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think
little of robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and

Education has been Neglected' no. 3, in the 'London Magazine'

distinction to 'many years' conversation with Mr Wordsworth'

were done before? Wilt thou forgive those sins, through which I run And
do them still: though still I do deplore? When thou hast done, thou hast
not done, For, I have more. Wilt thou forgive that sin by which I have
won Others to sin? and, made my sin their door? Wilt thou forgive that
sin which I did shun A year, or two: but wallowed in, a score? When thou
has done, thou hast not done, For I have more. 'A Hymn to God the

So, so, break off this last lamenting kiss, Which sucks two souls, and

thence doth spring,

Which is, to keep that hid. 'Songs and Sonnets' 'The Undertaking'

As virtuous men pass mildly away, And whisper to their souls, to go,
Whilst some of their sad friends do say, The breath goes now, and some
say, no: So let us melt, and make no noise, No tear-floods, nor
sigh-tempests move, 'Twere profanation of our joys To tell the laity our
love. 'Songs and Sonnets' 'A Valediction: forbidding mourning'

our conception, and we come into the world, wound up in that winding
sheet, for we come to seek a grave. 'Death's Duel' (1632)

That which we call life, is but hebdomada mortium, a week of death,
seven days, seven periods of our life spent in dying, a dying seven
times over; and there is an end. 'Death's Duel' (1632)

There we leave you, in that blessed dependancy, to hang upon him that
hangs upon the Cross, there bathe in his tears, there suck at his
wounds, and lie down in peace in his grave, till he vouchsafe you a
resurrection, and an ascension into that Kingdom, which he hath prepared
for you, with the inestimable price of his incorruptible blood. Amen.

But I do nothing upon my self, and yet I am mine own Executioner.
'Devotions upon Emergent Occasions' (1624) 'Meditation XII'

No man is an Island, entire of it self; every man is a piece of the
Continent, a part of the main;

if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a
promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own
were; any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind;
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for
thee. 'Devotions upon Emergent Occasions' (1624) 'Meditation XVII'

My God, my God, thou art a direct God, may I not say a literal God, a
God that wouldst be understood literally and according to the plain
sense of all that thou sayest? But thou art also...a figurative, a
metaphorical God too. 'Devotions upon Emergent Occasions' (1624)
'Expostulation XIX'

From this I testify her holy cheerfulness, and religious alacrity, (one
of the best evidences of a good conscience), that as she came to this
place, God's house of Prayer...she ever hastened her family, and her
company hither, with that cheerful provocation, For God's sake let's go,
For God's sake let's be there at the Confession. 'A Sermon of
Commemoration of the Lady Danvers' \[George Herbert's mother\] (1627)

Man is but earth; 'Tis true; but earth is the centre. That man who
dwells upon himself, who is always conversant in himself, rests in his
true centre. 'LXXX Sermons' (1640) Christmas Day, 1627

\[Death\] comes equally to us all, and makes us all equal when it comes.
The ashes of an Oak in the Chimney, are no epitaph of that Oak, to tell
me how high or how large that was; It tells me not what flocks it
sheltered while it stood, nor what men it hurt when it fell. The dust of
great persons' graves is speechless too, it says nothing, it
distinguishes nothing: As soon the dust of a wretch whom thou wouldest
not, as of a Prince whom thou couldest not look upon, will trouble thine
eyes, if the wind blow it thither; and when a whirlwind hath blown the
dust of the Churchyard into the Church, and the man sweeps out the dust
of the Church into the Churchyard, who will undertake to sift those
dusts again, and to pronounce, This is the Patrician, this is the noble
flower, and this the yeomanly, this the Plebeian bran. 'LXXX Sermons'

Poor intricated soul! Riddling, perplexed, labyrinthical soul! 'LXXX
Sermons' (1640) 25 January 1628/9

A day that hath no pridie, nor postridie, yesterday doth not usher it
in, nor tomorrow shall not drive it out. Methusalem, with all his
hundreds of years, was but a mushroom of a night's growth, to this day,
And all the four Monarchies, with all their thousands of years, and all
the powerful Kings and all the beautiful Queens of this world, were but
as a bed of flowers, some gathered at six, some at seven, some at eight,
All in one Morning, in respect of this Day. 'LXXX Sermons' (1640) 30
April 1626 'Eternity'

I throw myself down in my Chamber, and I call in, and invite God, and
his Angels thither, and when they are there, I neglect God and his
Angels, for the noise of a fly, for the rattling of a

coach, for the whining of a door. 'LXXX Sermons' (1640) 12 December 1626
'At the Funeral of Sir William Cokayne'

A memory of yesterday's pleasures, a fear of tomorrow's dangers, a straw
under my knee, a noise in mine ear, a light in mine eye, an anything, a
nothing, a fancy, a chimera in my brain, troubles me in my prayer. So
certainly is there nothing, nothing in spiritual things, perfect in this
world. 'LXXX Sermons' (1640) 12 December 1626 'At the Funeral of Sir
William Cokayne'

They shall awake as Jacob did, and say as Jacob said, Surely the Lord is
in this place, and this is no other but the house of God, and the gate
of heaven, And into that gate they shall enter, and in that house they
shall dwell, where there shall be no Cloud nor Sun, no darkness nor
dazzling, but one equal light, no noise nor silence, but one equal
music, no fears nor hopes, but one equal possession, no foes nor
friends, but one equal communion and identity, no ends nor beginnings,
but one equal eternity. 'XXVI Sermons' (1660) 29 February 1627/8

I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind, Flung roses, roses,
riotously, with the throng, Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of
mind; But I was desolate and sick of an old passion, Yea, all the time,
because the dance was long: I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my
fashion. 'Non Sum Qualis Eram' (also known as 'Cynara').

They are not long, the weeping and the laughter, Love and desire and
hate: I think they have no portion in us after We pass the gate. They
are not long, the days of wine and roses: Out of a misty dream Our path
emerges for a while, then closes Within a dream. 'Vitae Summa Brevis'

4.83 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 1859-1930 Singularity is almost invariably a
clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more
difficult is it to bring it home. 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'
(1892) 'The Boscombe Valley Mystery'.

It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and
vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin
than does the smiling and beautiful countryside. 'The Adventures of
Sherlock Holmes' (1892) 'The Copper Beeches'

A man should keep his little brain attic stocked with all the furniture
that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber
room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. 'The Adventures
of Sherlock Holmes' (1892) 'The Five Orange Pips'

It is quite a three-pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me

'Excellent,' I cried. 'Elementary,' said he. 'The Memoirs of Sherlock
Holmes' (1894) 'The Crooked Man'. 'Elementary, my dear Watson' is not
found in any book by Conan Doyle, although a review of the film 'The
Return of Sherlock Holmes' in 'New York Times' 19 October 1929, p. 22,
states: 'In the final scene Dr Watson is there with his 'Amazing,
Holmes', and Holmes comes forth with his 'Elementary, my dear Watson,
elementary''

I didn't think there was a soul in England who didn't know Godfrey
Staunton, the back three-quarter, Cambridge, Blackheath, and five
Internationals. Good Lord! Mr Holmes where have you lived. 'The Return
of Sherlock Holmes' (1905) 'The Missing Three-Quarter'

You live in a different world to me, Mr Watson, a sweeter and a
healthier one. My ramifications stretch out into many sections of
society, but never, I am happy to say, into amateur sport, which is the
best and soundest thing in England. 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes'
(1905) 'The Missing Three-Quarter'

Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science, and should be treated in
the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it
with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a
love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid. 'The
Sign of Four' (1890) ch. 1

In an experience of women that extends over many nations and three
separate continents, I have never looked upon a face which gave a

Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part, Nay, I have done: you
get no more of me, And I am glad, yea glad with all my heart, That thus
so cleanly, I myself can free, Shake hands for ever, cancel all our
vows, And when we meet at any time again, Be it not seen in either of
our brows, That we one jot of former love retain; Now at the last gasp
of Love's latest breath, When his pulse failing, Passion speechless
lies, When Faith is kneeling by his bed of death, And Innocence is
closing up his eyes, Now if thou wouldst, when all have given him over,
From death to life, thou might'st him yet recover. 'Idea' (1619) sonnet

4.93 John Dryden 1631-1700 In pious times, ere priestcraft did begin,
Before polygamy was made a sin. 'Absalom and Achitophel' (1681) pt. 1,
l. 1

Then Israel's monarch, after Heaven's own heart, His vigorous warmth
did, variously, impart To wives and slaves: and, wide as his command,
Scattered his Maker's image through the land. 'Absalom and Achitophel'
(1681) pt. 1, l. 7

Whate'er he did was done with so much ease, In him alone, 'twas natural
to please. 'Absalom and Achitophel' (1681) pt. 1, l. 27

Plots, true or false, are necessary things, To raise up commonwealths
and ruin kings. 'Absalom and Achitophel' (1681) pt. 1, l. 83

Of these the false Achitophel was first, A name to all succeeding ages
curst. For close designs and crooked counsels fit, Sagacious, bold, and
turbulent of wit, Restless, unfixed in principles and place, In power
unpleased, impatient of disgrace; A fiery soul, which working out its
way,

Fretted the pigmy body to decay: And o'er informed the tenement of clay.
A daring pilot in extremity; Pleased with the danger, when the waves
went high He sought the storms; but for a calm unfit, Would steer too
nigh the sands to boast his wit. Great wits are sure to madness near
allied, And thin partitions do their bounds divide. 'Absalom and
Achitophel' (1681) pt. 1, l. 150

Why should he, with wealth and honour blest, Refuse his age the needful
hours of rest? Punish a body which he could not please; Bankrupt of
life, yet prodigal of ease? And all to leave what with his toil he won
To that unfeathered two-legged thing, a son. 'Absalom and Achitophel'
(1681) pt. 1, l. 165

In friendship false, implacable in hate: Resolved to ruin or to rule the
state. 'Absalom and Achitophel' (1681) pt. 1, l. 173

Better one suffer, than a nation grieve. 'Absalom and Achitophel' (1681)
pt. 1, l. 416

But far more numerous was the herd of such Who think too little and who
talk too much. 'Absalom and Achitophel' (1681) pt. 1, l. 533

A man so various that he seemed to be Not one, but all mankind's
epitome. Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong; Was everything by
starts, and nothing long: But, in the course of one revolving moon, Was
chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon. 'Absalom and Achitophel'
(1681) pt. 1, l. 545

In squandering wealth was his peculiar art: Nothing went unrewarded, but
desert. Beggared by fools, whom still he found too late: He had his
jest, and they had his estate.

'Absalom and Achitophel' (1681) pt. 1, l. 559

Youth, beauty, graceful action seldom fail: But common interest always
will prevail: And pity never ceases to be shown To him, who makes the
people's wrongs his own. 'Absalom and Achitophel' (1681) pt. 1, l. 723

For who can be secure of private right, If sovereign sway may be
dissolved by might? Nor is the people's judgement always true: The most

Doeg, though without knowing how or why, Made still a blund'ring kind of
melody; Spurred boldly on, and dashed through thick and thin, Through
sense and nonsense, never out nor in; Free from all meaning, whether
good or bad, And in one word, heroically mad. 'Absalom and Achitophel'

With ravished ears The monarch hears, Assumes the god, Affects to nod,
And seems to shake the spheres. 'Alexander's Feast' (1697) l. 42

Drinking is the soldier's pleasure; Rich the treasure; Sweet the
pleasure; Sweet is pleasure after pain. 'Alexander's Feast' (1697) l. 57

Fallen from his high estate, And welt'ring in his blood: Deserted at his
utmost need By those his former bounty fed; On the bare earth exposed he
lies, With not a friend to close his eyes. 'Alexander's Feast' (1697) l.
78

Revolving in his altered soul The various turns of chance below.
'Alexander's Feast' (1697) l. 85

War, he sung, is toil and trouble; Honour but an empty bubble. Never

Sighed and looked, and sighed again. 'Alexander's Feast' (1697) l. 120

pearls must dive below. 'All for Love' (1678) prologue

My love's a noble madness. 'All for Love' (1678) act 2, sc. 1

Give, you gods, Give to your boy, your Caesar, The rattle of a globe to

Men are but children of a larger growth; Our appetites as apt to change

By viewing nature, nature's handmaid art, Makes mighty things from small
beginnings grow: Thus fishes first to shipping did impart, Their tail

An horrid stillness first invades the ear, And in that silence we the
tempest fear. 'Astraea Redux' (1660) l. 7

Death, in itself, is nothing; but we fear, To be we know not what, we
know not where. 'Aureng-Zebe' (1675) act 4, sc. 1

None would live past years again, Yet all hope pleasure in what yet
remain; And, from the dregs of life, think to receive, What the first
sprightly running could not give. 'Aureng-Zebe' (1675) act 4, sc. 1

Refined himself to soul, to curb the sense And made almost a sin of

Every age has a kind of universal genius, which inclines those that live
in it to some particular studies. 'An Essay of Dramatic Poesy' (1668)

A thing well said will be wit in all languages. 'An Essay of Dramatic
Poesy' (1668)

He was the man who of all modern, and perhaps ancient poets, had the
largest and most comprehensive soul...He was naturally learn'd; he
needed not the spectacles of books to read Nature: he looked inwards,
and found her there...He is many times flat, insipid; his comic wit
degenerating into clenches, his serious swelling into bombast. But he is
always great. 'An Essay of Dramatic Poesy' (1668) on Shakespeare

He invades authors like a monarch; and what would be theft in other
poets, is only victory in him. 'An Essay of Dramatic Poesy' (1668) on
Ben Jonson

If by the people you understand the multitude, the hoi polloi, 'tis no
matter what they think; they are sometimes in the right, sometimes in
the wrong: their judgement is a mere lottery. 'An Essay of Dramatic
Poesy' (1668)

\[Shakespeare\] is the very Janus of poets; he wears almost everywhere
two faces; and you have scarce begun to admire the one, ere you despise
the other. 'Essay on the Dramatic Poetry of the Last Age' (1672)

What judgement I had increases rather than diminishes; and thoughts,
such as they are, come crowding in so fast upon me, that my only
difficulty is to choose or reject; to run them into verse or to give
them the other harmony of prose. 'Fables Ancient and Modern' (1700)
preface

'Tis sufficient to say \[of Chaucer\], according to the proverb, that
here is God's plenty. 'Fables Ancient and Modern' (1700) preface

\[Chaucer\] is a perpetual fountain of good sense. 'Fables Ancient and
Modern' (1700) preface

One of our late great poets is sunk in his reputation, because he could
never forgive any conceit which came in his way; but swept like a
drag-net, great and small. There was plenty enough, but

the dishes were ill-sorted; whole pyramids of sweetmeats, for boys and
women; but little of solid meat for men. 'Fables Ancient and Modern'
(1700) preface (on Abraham Cowley)

How easy it is to call rogue and villain, and that wittily! But how hard
to make a man appear a fool, a blockhead, or a knave, without using any
of those opprobrious terms! To spare the grossness of the names, and to
do the thing yet more severely, is to draw a full face, and to make the
nose and cheeks stand out, and yet not to employ any depth of shadowing.
'Of Satire' (1693)

Sure the poet...spewed up a good lump of clotted nonsense at once. 'On
Settle'

A man may be capable, as Jack Ketch's wife said of his servant, of a
plain piece of work, a bare hanging; but to make a malefactor die
sweetly was only belonging to her husband. 'On Settle'

Plus que le marbre dur me plaist l'ardoise fine, Plus mon Loyre Gaulois,
que le Tybre Latin, Plus mon petit Lyrè, que le mont Palatin, Et plus

Anjou. 'Les regrets' (1558) sonnet no. 31

great end comes slowly, because time is long. Last message, written 26
June, 1957, and read at his funeral, 1963, in 'Journal of Negro History'

4.102 John Foster Dulles 1888-1959 You have to take chances for peace,
just as you must take chances in war. Some say that we were brought to
the verge of war. Of course we were brought to the verge of war. The
ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the
necessary art. If you cannot master it, you inevitably get into war. If
you try to run away from it, if you are scared to go to the brink, you
are lost. We've had to look it square in the face---on the question of
enlarging the Korean war, on the question of getting into the Indochina
war, on the question of Formosa. We walked to the brink and we looked it
in the face. In 'Life' 16 January 1956

5.19 Dwight D. Eisenhower 1890-1969 Every gun that is made, every
warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a
theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are
not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is
spending the sweat of its labourers, the genius of its scientists, the
hopes of its children. Speech in Washington, 16 April 1953, in 'Public
Papers of Presidents 1953' (1960) p. 182

You have broader considerations that might follow what you might call
the 'falling domino' principle. You have a row of dominoes set up. You
knock over the first one, and what will happen to the last one is that
it will go over very quickly. So you have the beginning of a
disintegration that would have the most profound influences. Speech at
press conference, 7 April 1954, in 'Public Papers of Presidents 1954'

5.21 George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) 1819-80 Our deeds determine us, as
much as we determine our deeds; and until we know what has been or will
be the peculiar combination of outward with inward facts, which
constitute a man's critical actions, it will be better not to think
ourselves wise about his character. 'Adam Bede' (1859) ch. 29

Gossip is a sort of smoke that comes from the dirty tobacco-pipes of

sincere interest in prolonging the lives of the poultry. 'Felix Holt'

A little daily embroidery had been a constant element in Mrs Transome's
life; that soothing occupation of taking stitches to produce what
neither she nor any one else wanted, was then the resource of many a
well-born and unhappy woman. 'Felix Holt' (1866) ch. 7

Speech is often barren; but silence also does not necessarily brood over
a full nest. Your still fowl, blinking at you without remark, may all
the while be sitting on one addled egg; and when it takes to cackling
will have nothing to announce but that addled delusion. 'Felix Holt'

epilogue

Many Theresas have been born who found for themselves no epic life
wherein there was a constant unfolding of far-resonant action; perhaps
only a life of mistakes, the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur
ill-matched with the meanness of opportunity; perhaps a tragic failure

which found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion. 'Middlemarch'
(1871-2) Prelude

A woman dictates before marriage in order that she may have an appetite
for submission afterwards. 'Middlemarch' (1871-2) bk. 1, ch. 9

He said he should prefer not to know the sources of the Nile, and that
there should be some unknown regions preserved as hunting-grounds for
the poetic imagination. 'Middlemarch' (1871-2) bk. 1, ch. 9

Among all forms of mistake, prophecy is the most gratuitous.
'Middlemarch' (1871-2) bk. 1, ch. 10

Plain women he regarded as he did the other severe facts of life, to be
faced with philosophy and investigated by science. 'Middlemarch'
(1871-2) bk. 1, ch. 11

Any one watching keenly the stealthy convergence of human lots, sees a
slow preparation of effects from one life or another, which tells like a
calculated irony on the indifference or the frozen stare with which we
look at our unintroduced neighbour. 'Middlemarch' (1871-2) bk. 1, ch. 11

If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would
be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel's heart beat, and we
should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence.
'Middlemarch' (1871-2) bk. 2, ch. 20

We do not expect people to be deeply moved by what is not unusual. That
element of tragedy which lies in the very fact of frequency, has not yet
wrought itself into the coarse emotion of mankind. 'Middlemarch'
(1871-2) bk. 2, ch. 20

A woman, let her be as good as she may, has got to put up with the life
her husband makes for her. 'Middlemarch' (1871-2) bk. 3, ch. 25

It is an uneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet
not to enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to
be liberated from a small hungry shivering self. 'Middlemarch' (1871-2)
bk. 3, ch. 29

A man is seldom ashamed of feeling that he cannot love a woman so well
when he sees a certain greatness in her: nature having intended
greatness for men. 'Middlemarch' (1871-2) bk. 4, ch. 39

Anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their objects than
love. 'The Mill on the Floss' (1860) bk. 1, ch. 10

In every parting there is an image of death. 'Scenes of Clerical Life'
(1858) 'Amos Barton' ch. 10

Errors look so very ugly in persons of small means---one feels they are
taking quite a liberty in going astray; whereas people of fortune may
naturally indulge in a few delinquencies. 'Scenes of Clerical Life'

Life is too precious to be spent in this weaving and unweaving of false
impressions, and it is better to live quietly under some degree of
misrepresentation than to attempt to remove it by the uncertain process
of letter-writing. Letter to Mrs Peter Taylor, 8 June 1856

If art does not enlarge men's sympathies, it does nothing morally.
Letter, 5 July 1859

The idea of God, so far as it has been a high spiritual influence, is
the ideal of a goodness entirely human. In G. S. Haight (ed.) 'The
George Eliot Letters' vol. 6

She, stirred somewhat beyond her wont, and taking as her text the three
words which have been used so often as the inspiring trumpet-calls of
men---the words God, Immortality, Duty--- pronounced, with terrible
earnestness, how inconceivable was the first, how unbelievable the
second, and yet how peremptory and absolute the third. Never, perhaps,
have sterner accents affirmed the sovereignty of impersonal and
unrecompensing Law. F. W. H. Myers 'George Eliot', in 'Century Magazine'

Alps. Over buttered scones and crumpets Weeping, weeping multitudes

Success is relative: It is what we can make of the mess we have made of
things. 'The Family Reunion' (1939) pt. 2, sc. 3

Round and round the circle Completing the charm So the knot be unknotted
The cross be uncrossed The crooked be made straight And the curse be
ended. 'The Family Reunion' (1939) pt. 2, sc. 3

Stand on the highest pavement of the stair--- Lean on a garden urn---
Weave, weave the sunlight in your hair. 'La Figlia Che Piange' (1917)

Sometimes these cogitations still amaze The troubled midnight and the
noon's repose. 'La Figlia Che Piange' (1917)

Time present and time past Are both perhaps present in time future, And
time future contained in time past.

At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;
Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is, But
neither arrest nor movement. 'Four Quartets' 'Burnt Norton' (1936) pt. 2

Words strain, Crack and sometimes break, under the burden, Under the
tension, slip, slide, perish, Decay with imprecision, will not stay in
place, Will not stay still. 'Four Quartets' 'Burnt Norton' (1936) pt. 5

In my beginning is my end. 'Four Quartets' 'East Coker' (1940) pt. 1.

That was a way of putting it---not very satisfactory: A periphrastic
study in a worn-out poetical fashion, Leaving one still with the
intolerable wrestle With words and meanings. The poetry does not matter.
'Four Quartets' 'East Coker' (1940) pt. 2

The houses are all gone under the sea. The dancers are all gone under

Beneath the bleeding hands we feel The sharp compassion of the healer's

Each venture

I do not know much about gods; but I think that the river Is a strong
brown god---sullen, untamed and intractable. 'Four Quartets' 'The Dry

And what the dead had no speech for, when living, They can tell you,
being dead: the communication Of the dead is tongued with fire beyond
the language of the living. 'Four Quartets' 'Little Gidding' (1942)
pt. 1

Ash on an old man's sleeve Is all the ash the burnt roses leave. Dust in
the air suspended Marks the place where a story ended. Dust inbreathed
was a house--- The wall, the wainscot and the mouse. The death of hope
and despair, This is the death of air. 'Four Quartets' 'Little Gidding'
(1942) pt. 2

Since our concern was speech, and speech impelled us To purify the
dialect of the tribe And urge the mind to aftersight and foresight.
'Four Quartets' 'Little Gidding' (1942) pt. 2

We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first
time. 'Four Quartets' 'Little Gidding' (1942) pt. 5

What we call the beginning is often the end And to make an end is to
make a beginning. The end is where we start from. 'Four Quartets'

A people without history Is not redeemed from time, for history is a
pattern Of timeless moments. So, while the light fails On a winter's
afternoon, in a secluded chapel History is now and England. 'Four

A condition of complete simplicity

After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now History has many

A cold coming we had of it, Just the worst time of the year For a
journey, and such a long journey: The ways deep and the weather sharp,
The very dead of winter. 'Journey of the Magi' (1927).

But set down This set down This: were we led all that way for Birth or
Death? There was a Birth, certainly, We had evidence and no doubt. I had
seen birth and death But had thought they were different; this Birth was
Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death. We returned to our
places, these Kingdoms, But no longer at ease here, in the old
dispensation, With an alien people clutching their gods. I should be
glad of another death. 'Journey of the Magi' (1927)

I grow old...I grow old... I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a Cat

Unreal City, Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, A crowd flowed over
London Bridge, so many, I had not thought death had undone so many.

Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea, The typist home at
teatime, clears her breakfast, lights Her stove, and lays out food in

In the seventeenth century a dissociation of sensibility set in, from
which we have never recovered; and this dissociation, as is natural, was
due to the influence of the two most powerful poets of the century,
Milton and Dryden. 'The Metaphysical Poets' (1921)

Poets in our civilization, as it exists at present, must be difficult.

The only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by finding an
'objective correlative'; in other words, a set of objects, a situation,
a chain of events which shall be the formula of that particular emotion;

experience, are given, the emotion is immediately evoked. 'The Sacred
Wood' (1920) 'Hamlet and his Problems'

is not the expression of personality but an escape from personality.

and subtlety they have no conception. They go forth into it with
well-developed bodies, fairly developed minds, and undeveloped hearts.
'Abinger Harvest' (1936) 'Notes on English Character'

It is not that the Englishman can't feel---it is that he is afraid to

Psychoanalysis, 1933) ch. 31

In the nineteenth century the problem was that God is dead; in the

slaves. The danger of the future is that men may become robots. 'The
Sane Society' (1955) ch. 9

They cannot scare me with their empty spaces Between stars---on stars
where no human race is. I have it in me so much nearer home To scare
myself with my own desert places. 'Desert Places' (1936)

Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. From what I've
tasted of desire I hold with those who favour fire. But if it had to
perish twice, I think I know enough of hate To say that for destruction
ice Is also great And would suffice. 'Fire and Ice' (1923)

writer, no surprise for the reader. 'Collected Poems' (1939) 'The Figure
a Poem Makes'

melting. A poem may be worked over once it is in being, but may not be
worried into being. 'Collected Poems' (1939) 'The Figure a Poem Makes'

even religious concord. 'The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'

the experience of mankind. 'Memoirs of My Life' (1796) ch. 1

It was at Rome, on the fifteenth of October, 1764, as I sat musing
amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the barefoot friars were singing
vespers in the Temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline
and fall of the city first started to my mind. 'Memoirs of My Life'
(1796) ch. 6

I will not dissemble the first emotions of joy on the recovery of my
freedom, and, perhaps, the establishment of my fame. But my pride was
soon humbled, and a sober melancholy was spread over my mind, by the
idea that I had taken an everlasting leave of an old and agreeable
companion, and that whatsoever might be the future date of my History,
the life of the historian must be short and precarious. 'Memoirs of My
Life' (1796) ch. 8 (on the completion of 'Decline and Fall')

7.40 Kahlil Gibran 1883-1931 Your children are not your children. They
are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They came
through you but not from you And though they are with you yet they
belong not to you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not
their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you
cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them,
but seek not to make them like you, For life goes not backward nor
tarries with yesterday. You are the bows from which your children as
living arrows are sent forth. 'The Prophet' (1923) 'On Children'

Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work with love but only
with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at
the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy. 'The

For you dream you are crossing the Channel, and tossing about in a
steamer from Harwich--- Which is something between a large bathing
machine and a very small second class carriage. 'Iolanthe' (1882) act 2

And bound on that journey you find your attorney (who started that

still und hoch der Lorbeer steht--- Kennst du es wohl? Dahin! Dahin!
Möcht ich mit dir, o mein Geliebter, ziehn! Know you the land where the

plain, Where health and plenty cheered the labouring swain. 'The
Deserted Village' (1770) l. 1

Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey, Where wealth accumulates,
and men decay; Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade; A breath can
make them, as a breath has made; But a bold peasantry, their country's
pride, When once destroyed, can never be supplied. A time there was, ere
England's griefs began, When every rood of ground maintained its man;
For him light labour spread her wholesome store, Just gave what life
required, but gave no more; His best companions, innocence and health;
And his best riches, ignorance of wealth. 'The Deserted Village' (1770)
l. 51

Village' (1770) l. 150

Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway, And fools, who came to

A man severe he was, and stern to view; I knew him well, and every
truant knew; Well had the boding tremblers learned to trace The day's
disasters in his morning face; Full well they laughed with counterfeited
glee, At all his jokes, for many a joke had he.

In arguing too, the parson owned his skill, For e'en though vanquished,
he could argue still; While words of learned length, and thund'ring
sound Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around, And still they gazed, and

Deserted Village' (1770) l. 211

Fair laughs the morn, and soft the zephyr blows, While proudly riding
o'er the azure realm In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes; Youth on
the prow, and Pleasure at the helm; Regardless of the sweeping
whirlwind's sway, That, hushed in grim repose, expects his evening prey.
'The Bard' (1757) l. 71

The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, The lowing herd wind slowly
o'er the lea, The ploughman homeward plods his weary way, And leaves the
world to darkness and to me. Now fades the glimering landscape on the
sight, And all the air a solemn stillness holds, Save where the beetle
wheels his droning flight, And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds.
'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard' (1751) l. 1

Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r, The moping owl does to the moon
complain. 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard' (1751) l. 9

Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade, Where heaves the turf
in many a mouldering heap, Each in his narrow cell for ever laid, The
rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep. The breezy call of
incense-breathing Morn, The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built
shed, The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn, No more shall
rouse them from their lowly bed. 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard'
(1751) l. 13

Let not ambition mock their useful toil, Their homely joys, and destiny
obscure; Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile, The short and simple
annals of the poor. The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r, And all
that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave, Awaits alike th'inevitable hour,
The paths of glory lead but to the grave. 'Elegy Written in a Country
Churchyard' (1751) l. 29

Can storied urn or animated bust Back to its mansion call the fleeting
breath?

Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust, Or flatt'ry soothe the dull
cold ear of death? 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard' (1751) l. 41

Full many a gem of purest ray serene, The dark unfathomed caves of ocean
bear: Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its
sweetness on the desert air. Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless
breast The little tyrant of his fields withstood; Some mute inglorious
Milton here may rest, Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.
'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard' (1751) l. 53

Their lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone Their growing virtues, but
their crimes confined; Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne, And
shut the gates of mercy on mankind. 'Elegy Written in a Country
Churchyard' (1751) l. 65

Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife, Their sober wishes never
learned to stray; Along the cool sequestered vale of life They kept the
noiseless tenor of their way. 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard'
(1751) l. 73

For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey, This pleasing anxious being e'er
resigned, Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day, Nor cast one
longing ling'ring look behind? 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard'

Mindful of th' unhonoured dead 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard'

Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth A youth to fortune and to fame
unknown. Fair Science frowned not on his humble birth, And Melancholy

He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear, He gained from Heav'n ('twas all

Not all that tempts your wand'ring eyes And heedless hearts, is lawful

snatch a fearful joy. 'Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College' (1747)
l. 38

Alas, regardless of their doom, The little victims play! No sense have
they of ills to come, Nor care beyond to-day. 'Ode on a Distant Prospect
of Eton College' (1747) l. 51

To each his suff'rings, all are men, Condemned alike to groan; The
tender for another's pain, Th' unfeeling for his own. Yet ah! why should
they know their fate? Since sorrow never comes too late, And happiness
too swiftly flies. Thought would destroy their paradise. No more; where
ignorance is bliss, 'Tis folly to be wise. 'Ode on a Distant Prospect of
Eton College' (1747) l. 91

The meanest floweret of the vale, The simplest note that swells the
gale, The common sun, the air, the skies, To him are opening paradise.

Far from the sun and summer-gale, In thy green lap was Nature's darling
laid. 'The Progress of Poesy' (1757) l. 83 (on Shakespeare)

Nor second he, that rode sublime Upon the seraph-wings of ecstasy, The
secrets of th'abyss to spy. He passed the flaming bounds of place and
time:

The living throne, the sapphire-blaze, Where angels tremble, while they
gaze, He saw; but blasted with excess of light, Closed his eyes in
endless night. 'The Progress of Poesy' (1757) l. 95 (on Milton)

Thoughts, that breathe, and words, that burn. 'The Progress of Poesy'
(1757) l. 110

Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate, Beneath the good how far---but far

Too poor for a bribe, and too proud to importune, He had not the method
of making a fortune. 'Sketch of his own Character'

They had been corrupted by money, and he had been corrupted by
sentiment. Sentiment was the more dangerous, because you couldn't name
its price. A man open to bribes was to be relied upon below a certain

It was at present a place perfectly accordant with man's
nature---neither ghastly, hateful, nor ugly: neither commonplace,
unmeaning, nor tame; but, like man, slighted and enduring; and withal
singularity colossal and mysterious in its swarthy monotony. As with
some persons who have long lived a past, solitude seemed to look out of
its countenance. It had a lonely face, suggesting tragical
possibilities. 'The Return of the Native' (1878) bk. 1, ch. 1 (Egdon
Heath)

Human beings, in their generous endeavour to construct a hypothesis that

phrase) had ended his sport with Tess. 'Tess of the D'Urbervilles'

Good, but not religious-good. 'Under the Greenwood Tree' (1872) ch. 2

It was one of those sequestered spots outside the gates of the
world...where, from time to time, dramas of a grandeur and unity truly
Sophoclean are enacted in the real, by virtue of the concentrated
passions and closely knit interdependence of the lives therein. 'The
Woodlanders' (1887) ch. 1

When the Present has latched its postern behind my tremulous stay, And
the May month flaps its glad green leaves like wings, Delicate-filmed as
new-spun silk, will the neighbours say, 'He was a man who used to notice
such things'? 'Afterwards' (1917)

The bower we shrined to Tennyson, Gentlemen, Is roof-wrecked; damps
there drip upon

Sagged seats, the creeper-nails are rust, The spider is sole denizen;
Even she who voiced those rhymes is dust, Gentlemen! 'An Ancient to
Ancients' (1922)

'Peace upon earth!' was said. We sing it, And pay a million priests to

In a solitude of the sea Deep from human vanity, And the Pride of Life
that planned her, stilly couches she. Steel chambers, late the pyres Of
her salamandrine fires, Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal
lyres. Over the mirrors meant To glass the opulent The sea-worm
crawls---grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent. 'Convergence of the
Twain' (1914)

The Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything. 'Convergence of the
Twain' (1914)

At once a voice outburst among The bleak twigs overhead In a
full-hearted evensong Of joy illimited; An aged thrush, frail, gaunt,
and small, In blast-beruffled plume, Had chosen thus to fling his soul
Upon the growing gloom. So little cause for carollings Of such ecstatic
sound Was written on terrestrial things Afar or nigh around, That I
could think there trembled through His happy good-night air Some blessed
Hope, whereof he knew And I was unaware. 'The Darkling Thrush' (1902)

If way to the Better there be, it exacts a full look at the worst. 'De
Profundis' (1902)

Well, World, you have kept faith with me, Kept faith with me; Upon the
whole you have proved to be Much as you said you were. 'He Never
Expected Much' (1928)

I am the family face; Flesh perishes, I live on, Projecting trait and
trace Through time to times anon, And leaping from place to place Over
oblivion. 'Heredity' (1917)

I look into my glass, And viewing wasting skin, And say, 'Would you it
came to pass My heart had shrunk as thin!' For then, I, undistrest By
hearts grown cold to me, Could lonely wait my endless rest With
equanimity. But Time, to make me grieve, Part steals, lets part abide;
And shakes this fragile frame at eve With throbbings of noontide. 'I
look into my glass'

Only a man harrowing clods In a slow silent walk With an old horse that
stumbles and nods Half asleep as they stalk. Only thin smoke without
flame From the heaps of couch-grass; Yet this will go onward the same
Though Dynasties pass. Yonder a maid and her wight Come whispering by:
War's annals will cloud into night Ere their story die.

'In Time of "The Breaking of Nations"' (1917)

Let me enjoy the earth no less Because the all-enacting Might That
fashioned forth its loveliness Had other aims than my delight. 'Let me
Enjoy' (1909)

Yes; quaint and curious war is! You shoot a fellow down You'd treat if

What of the faith and fire within us Men who march away Ere the
barn-cocks say Night is growing grey, To hazards whence no tears can win
us; What of the faith and fire within us Men who march away? 'Men Who
March Away' (1914)

In the third-class seat sat the journeying boy And the roof-lamp's oily
flame Played down on his listless form and face, Bewrapt past knowing to
what he was going, Or whence he came. 'Midnight on the Great Western'
(1917)

When I set out for Lyonnesse, A hundred miles away, The rime was on the
spray, And starlight lit my lonesomeness When I set out for Lyonnesse A
hundred miles away. 'When I set out for Lyonnesse' (1870)

Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me, Saying that now you
are not as you were When you had changed from the one who was all to me,
But as at first, when our day was fair. 'The Voice'

This is the weather the cuckoo likes, And so do I; When showers betumble
the chestnut spikes,

And nestlings fly: And the little brown nightingale bills his best, And
they sit outside at 'The Travellers' Rest', And maids come forth
sprig-muslin drest, And citizens dream of the south and west, And so do
I. 'Weathers' (1922)

And meadow rivulets overflow, And drops on gate-bars hang in a row, And
rooks in families homeward go, And so do I. 'Weathers' (1922)

What though the spicy breezes Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle; Though every
prospect pleases, And only man is vile: In vain with lavish kindness The
gifts of God are strown; The heathen in his blindness Bows down to wood
and stone. 'From Greenland's icy mountains' (1821 hymn). Heber later
altered 'Ceylon's isle' to 'Java's isle'.

The way that takes the town; Thou didst betray me to a lingering book,
And wrap me in a gown. 'Affliction (1)' (1633) l. 37

Now I am here, what thou wilt do with me None of my books will show: I
read, and sigh, and wish I were a tree; For then I should grow To fruit
or shade: at least some bird would trust Her household to me, and I
should be just. 'Affliction (1)' (1633) l. 55

Ah, my dear God! though I am clean forgot, Let me not love Thee, if I
love Thee not. 'Affliction (1)' (1633) l. 65

Love is that liquor sweet and most divine, Which my God feels as blood;
but I, as wine. 'The Agonie' (1633) l. 17

Let all the world in ev'ry corner sing My God and King. The heavens are
not too high, His praise may thither fly; The earth is not too low, His
praises there may grow. Let all the world in ev'ry corner sing My God
and King. The Church with psalms must shout, No door can keep them out:
But above all, the heart Must bear the longest part.

O England! full of sin, but most of sloth; Spit out thy phlegm, and fill
thy breast with glory. 'The Church Porch' (1633) st. 16

Judge not the preacher, for he is thy Judge: If thou mislike him, thou
conceiv'st him not. God calleth preaching folly. Do not grudge To pick
out treasures from an earthen pot. The worst speaks something good: if
all want sense, God takes a text, and preacheth patience. 'The Church
Porch' (1633) st. 72

I struck the board, and cried, 'No more. I will abroad.' What? shall I
ever sigh and pine? My lines and life are free; free as the road, Loose
as the wind, as large as store. Shall I be still in suit? Have I no
harvest but a thorn To let me blood, and not restore What I have lost
with cordial fruit? Sure there was wine Before my sighs did dry it;
there was corn Before my tears did drown it; Is the year only lost to
me? Have I no bays to crown it? 'The Collar' (1633)

Away; take heed: I will abroad. Call in thy death's-head there: tie up
thy fears. He that forbears To suit and serve his need, Deserves his
load. But as I raved and grew more fierce and wild At every word,
Methought I heard one calling, 'Child';

And I replied, 'My Lord.' 'The Collar' (1633)

O that thou shouldst give dust a tongue To cry to thee, And then not

Love is swift of foot; Love's a man of war, And can shoot, And can hit

I got me flowers to strew Thy way; I got me boughs off many a tree: But
Thou wast up by break of day, And brought'st Thy sweets along with Thee.
'Easter' (1633)

Teach me, my God and King, In all things Thee to see, And what I do in

A man that looks on glass, On it may stay his eye; Or if he pleaseth,
through it pass, And then the heaven espy. 'The Elixir' (1633)

A servant with this clause Makes drudgery divine: Who sweeps a room as
for Thy laws Makes that and th' action fine. 'The Elixir' (1633)

Oh that I were an orange-tree, That busy plant! Then I should ever laden

Who would have thought my shrivelled heart Could have recovered

And now in age I bud again, After so many deaths I live and write; I

It cannot be That I am he On whom Thy tempests fell all night. 'The
Flower' (1633)

I made a posy while the day ran by: Here will I smell my remnant out,
and tie My life within this band. But Time did beckon to the flowers,
and they By noon most cunningly did steal away, And withered in my hand.
'Life' (1633)

Love bade me welcome: yet my soul drew back, Guilty of dust and sin. But
quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack From my first entrance in, Drew
nearer to me, sweetly questioning, If I lacked any thing. 'Love: Love
bade me welcome' (1633)

'You must sit down,' says Love, 'and taste my meat.' So I did sit and
eat. 'Love: Love bade me welcome' (1633)

For us the winds do blow, The earth doth rest, heaven move, and
fountains flow. Nothing we see, but means our good, As our delight or as

Oh mighty love! Man is one world, and hath Another to attend him.

'Prayer: Prayer the Church's banquet' (1633)

When God at first made man, Having a glass of blessings standing by; Let
us (said he) pour on him all we can: Let the world's riches, which
dispersed lie, Contract into a span. 'The Pulley' (1633)

He would adore my gifts instead of Me, And rest in Nature, not the God
of Nature: So both should losers be. 'The Pulley' (1633)

Yet let him keep the rest, But keep them with repining restlessness: Let
him be rich and weary, that at least, If goodness lead him not, yet
weariness May toss him to My breast. 'The Pulley' (1633)

Lord, with what care Thou hast begirt us round! Parents first season us:
then schoolmasters Deliver us to laws; they send us bound To rules of
reason, holy messengers, Pulpits and Sundays, sorrow dogging sin,
Afflictions sorted, anguish of all sizes, Fine nets and stratagems to
catch us in, Bibles laid open, millions of surprises. 'Sin: Lord, with

The God of love my Shepherd is, And He that doth me feed: While He is

Lord, make me coy and tender to offend: In friendship, first I think, if
that agree Which I intend, Unto my friend's intent and end. I would not
use a friend, as I use Thee. 'Unkindness' (1633)

My friend may spit upon my curious floor: Would he have gold? I lend it
instantly; But let the poor, And Thou within them, starve at door. I
cannot use a friend, as I use Thee. 'Unkindness' (1633)

Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright, The bridal of the earth and sky,
The dew shall weep thy fall to-night; For thou must die. Sweet rose,
whose hue angry and brave Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye: Thy root is
ever in its grave, And thou must die. Sweet spring, full of sweet days
and roses, A box where sweets compacted lie; My music shows ye have your
closes, And all must die. 'Virtue' (1633)

Only a sweet and virtuous soul, Like seasoned timber, never gives; But

Stay, stay, Until the hasting day Has run But to the even-song; And,

For as the nature of foul weather, lieth not in a shower or two of rain;

'Leviathan' (1651) pt. 2, ch. 20

For it is with the mysteries of our religion, as with wholesome pills

'An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding' (1748) sect. 5, pt. 1

If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics,
for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning
concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental
reasoning, concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then
to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.

Their credulity increases his impudence: and his impudence overpowers
their credulity. 'An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding' (1748) 'Of
Miracles' pt. 2 (on religious enthusiasts)

We soon learn that there is nothing mysterious or supernatural in the
case, but that all proceeds from the usual propensity of mankind towards
the marvellous, and that, though this inclination may at intervals
receive a check from sense and learning, it can never be thoroughly
extirpated from human nature. 'An Enquiry Concerning Human
Understanding' (1748) 'Of Miracles' pt. 2

The Christian religion not only was at first attended with miracles, but
even at this day cannot be believed by any reasonable person without
one. Mere reason is insufficient to convince us of its veracity: and
whoever is moved by faith to assent to it, is conscious of a continued
miracle in his own person, which subverts all the principles of his
understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most
contrary to custom and experience. 'An Enquiry Concerning Human
Understanding' (1748) 'Of Miracles' pt. 2

Avarice, the spur of industry, is so obstinate a passion, and works its
way through so many real dangers and difficulties, that it is not likely
to be scared by an imaginary danger, which is so small that it scarcely
admits of calculation. 'Essays' (1741-2) 'Of Civil Liberty'

It cannot reasonably be doubted, but a little miss, dressed in a new
gown for a dancing-school

triumphs in the splendour of his eloquence, while he governs the
passions and resolutions of a numerous assembly. 'Essays' (1741-2) 'The
Sceptic'

Should it be said, that, by living under the dominion of a prince, which
one might leave, every individual has given a tacit assent to his
authority...We may as well assert, that a man by remaining in a vessel,
freely consents to the dominion of the master; though he was carried on
board while asleep, and must leap into the ocean, and perish, the moment
he leaves her. 'Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary' (ed. T. H. Green

In all matters of opinion and science...the difference between men
is...oftener found to lie in generals than in particulars; and to be
less in reality than in appearance. An explanation of the terms commonly
ends the controversy, and the disputants are surprised to find that they
had been quarrelling, while at bottom they agreed in their judgement.

Grose, 1875) 'Of the Standard of Taste' (1757)

Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!) Awoke one night from a deep
dream of peace, And saw, within the moonlight in his room, Making it
rich, and like a lily in bloom, An angel writing in a book of gold:---
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold, And to the presence in the room
he said, 'What writest thou?'---The vision raised its head, And with a
look made of all sweet accord, Answered, 'The names of those who love
the Lord.' 'Abou Ben Adhem' (1838)

seaward from the town. 'The Story of Rimini' (1816) canto 1, l. 18

8.166 T. H. Huxley 1825-95 Every variety of philosophical and
theological opinion was represented there \[the Metaphysical Society\],
and expressed itself with entire openness; most of my colleagues
were---ists of one sort or another; and, however kind and friendly they
might be, I, the man without a rag of a label to cover himself with,
could not fail to have some of the uneasy feelings which must have beset
the historical fox when, after leaving the trap in which his tail
remained, he presented himself to his normally elongated companions. So
I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate
title of 'agnostic'. 'Collected Essays' (1893-94) 'Agnosticism'

The great tragedy of Science---the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by
an ugly fact. 'Collected Essays' (1893-94) 'Biogenesis and Abiogenesis'

Science is nothing but trained and organized common sense, differing
from the latter only as a veteran may differ from a raw recruit: and its
methods differ from those of common sense only as

far as the guardsman's cut and thrust differ from the manner in which a
savage wields his club. 'Collected Essays' (1893-94) 'The Method of
Zadig'

If some great Power would agree to make me always think what is true and
do what is right, on condition of being turned into a sort of clock and
wound up every morning before I got out of bed, I should instantly close
with the offer. 'Collected Essays' (1893-94) 'On Descartes' 'Discourse
on Method'' (written 1870)

If a little knowledge is dangerous, where is the man who has so much as

The chess-board is the world; the pieces are the phenomena of the
universe; the rules of the game are what we call the laws of Nature. The
player on the other side is hidden from us. We know that his play is
always fair, just, and patient. But also we know, to our cost, that he
never overlooks a mistake, or makes the smallest allowance for
ignorance. 'Lay Sermons, Addresses, and Reviews' (1870) 'A Liberal
Education'

Some experience of popular lecturing had convinced me that the necessity
of making things plain to uninstructed people was one of the very best
means of clearing up the obscure corners in one's own mind. 'Man's Place
in Nature' (1894 ed.) preface

It is the customary fate of new truths to begin as heresies and to end

I asserted---and I repeat---that a man has no reason to be ashamed of
having an ape for his grandfather. If there were an ancestor whom I
should feel shame in recalling it would rather be a man---a man of
restless and versatile intellect---who, not content with an equivocal
success in his own sphere of activity, plunges into scientific questions
with which he has no real acquaintance, only to obscure them by an
aimless rhetoric, and distract the attention of his hearers from the
real point at issue by eloquent digressions and skilled appeals to
religious prejudice. Replying to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce in the debate
on Darwin's theory of evolution during the meeting of the British
Association at Oxford, 30 June 1860. See letter from J. R. Green to
Professor Boyd Dawkins in Leonard Huxley (ed.) 'The Life and Letters of
Thomas Henry Huxley' (1900). In a letter to Francis Darwin, Huxley
agreed that this account was fair if not wholly accurate: there is no
reliable verbatim transcript.

One might ennumerate the items of high civilization, as it exists in
other countries, which are absent from the texture of American life,
until it should become a wonder to know what was left. No State, in the
European sense of the word, and indeed barely a specific national name.
No sovereign, no court, no personal loyalty, no aristocracy, no church,
no clergy, no army, no diplomatic service, no country gentlemen, no
palaces, no castles, nor manors, nor old country houses, nor parsonages,
nor thatched cottages, nor ivied ruins; no cathedrals nor abbeys, nor
little Norman churches; no great universities nor public schools---no
Oxford, nor Eton, nor Harrow; no literature, no novels, no museums, no
pictures, no political society, no sporting class---no Epsom nor
Ascot!...The natural remark in the almost lurid light of such an
indictment, would be that if these things are left out, everything is
left out. 'Hawthorne' (1879)

Whatever question there may be of his talent, there can be none, I

becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which
have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the
earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of
Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind
requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the
separation. Declaration of Independence, 4 July 1776; preamble

We hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable; that all men are
created equal and independent, that from that equal creation they derive
rights inherent and inalienable, among which are the preservation of
life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Original draft for the
Declaration of Independence.

All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will
of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will to be rightful
must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which
equal law must protect, and to violate would be oppression. First

kind; for I can apply no milder term to the governments of Europe, and
to the general prey of the rich on the poor. Letter to Colonel Edward
Carrington, 16 January 1787

A little rebellion now and then is a good thing. Letter to James
Madison, 30 January 1787, in Thomas Jefferson Randolph (ed.) 'Memoirs,

The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood

p. 269

Whenever a man has cast a longing eye on them, a rottenness begins in
his conduct. Letter to Tench Coxe, 1799 (on official positions)

If the principle were to prevail of a common law \[i.e a single
government\] being in force in the United States...it would become the
most corrupt government on the earth. Letter to Gideon Granger, 13
August 1800, in Thomas Jefferson Randolph (ed.) 'Memoirs, Correspondence
and Private Papers of Thomas Jefferson' (1829) vol. 3, p. 445

I agree with you that there is a natural aristocracy among men. The
grounds of this are virtue and talents. Letter to John Adams, 28 October
1813

If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization,
it expects what never was and never will be. Letter to Colonel Charles
Yancey, 6 January 1816

I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the
people themselves; and if we think of them not enlightened enough to
exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to
take it from them, but to inform their discretion. Letter to William
Charles Jarvis, 28 September 1816

We are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate
any error so long as reason is left free to combat it. Letter to William
Roscoe, 27 December 1820

To attain all this \[universal republicanism\], however, rivers of blood
must yet flow, and years of desolation pass over; yet the object is
worth rivers of blood, and years of desolation. Letter to John Adams, 4
September 1823, in Thomas Jefferson Randolph (ed.) 'Memoirs,
Correspondence and Private Papers of Thomas Jefferson' (1829) vol. 4,
p. 387

If a due participation of office is a matter of right, how are vacancies
to be obtained? Those by death are few; by resignation none. Letter to
John Adams, 4 September 1823 (usually quoted, 'Few die and none
resign'), in Thomas Jefferson Randolph (ed.) 'Memoirs, Correspondence
and Private Papers of Thomas Jefferson' (1829) vol. 4, p. 387

Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the introduction of
Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned; yet we have
not advanced one inch towards uniformity \[of opinion\]. What has been
the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other
half hypocrites. 'Notes on the State of Virginia' (1781-5) Query 17

Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just. 'Notes

10.18 Roy Jenkins (Baron Jenkins of Hillhead) 1920--- The politics of

10.29 Pope John XXIII (Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli) 1881-1963 If civil
authorities legislate for or allow anything that is contrary to that
order and therefore contrary to the will of God, neither the laws made

I am not yet so lost in lexicography as to forget that words are the

signs might be permanent, like the things which they denote. 'A

Love is only one of many passions. 'The Plays of William Shakespeare,

Shakespeare has united the powers of exciting laughter and sorrow not
only in one mind but in one composition...That this is a practice
contrary to the rules of criticism will be readily allowed; but there is
always an appeal open from criticism to nature. 'The Plays of William
Shakespeare, with Notes' (1765) preface (Yale ed., p. 67)

A quibble is to Shakespeare, what luminous vapours are to the traveller;
he follows it at all adventures, it is sure to lead him out of his way
and sure to engulf him in the mire. 'The Plays of William Shakespeare,
with Notes' (1765) preface (Yale ed., p. 74)

It must be at last confessed, that as we owe everything to him
\[Shakespeare\], he owes something to us; that, if much of our praise is
paid by perception and judgement, much is likewise given by custom and
veneration. We fix our eyes upon his graces, and turn them from his
deformities, and endure in him what we should in another loathe or
despise. 'The Plays of William Shakespeare, with Notes' (1765) preface

There are minds so impatient of inferiority, that their gratitude is a
species of revenge, and they return benefits, not because recompense is
a pleasure, but because obligation is a pain. 'The Rambler' no. 87 (15

No place affords a more striking conviction of the vanity of human

Ye who listen with credulity to the whispers of fancy, and pursue with
eagerness the phantoms of hope; who expect that age will perform the
promises of youth, and that the deficiencies of the present day will be
supplied by the morrow; attend to the history of Rasselas prince of
Abyssinia. 'Rasselas' (1759) ch. 1

The business of a poet, said Imlac, is to examine, not the individual,
but the species; to remark general properties and appearances: he does
not number the streaks of the tulip, or describe the different shades in
the verdure of the forest. 'Rasselas' (1759) ch. 10

He \[the poet\] must write as the interpreter of nature, and the
legislator of mankind, and consider himself as presiding over the
thoughts and manners of future generations; as a being superior to time
and place. 'Rasselas' (1759) ch. 10.

Human life is everwhere a state in which much is to be endured, and
little to be enjoyed. 'Rasselas' (1759) ch. 11

Marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no pleasures. 'Rasselas'
(1759) ch. 26

Example is always more efficacious than precept. 'Rasselas' (1759)
ch. 30

It \[the Pyramids\] seems to have been erected only in compliance with
that hunger of imagination which preys incessantly upon life, and must
be always appeased by some employment...I consider this mighty structure
as a monument of the insufficiency of human enjoyments. 'Rasselas'
(1759) ch. 32

Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without
integrity is dangerous and dreadful. 'Rasselas' (1759) ch. 41

There is perhaps no class of men, to whom the precept given by the
Apostle to his converts against too great confidence in their
understandings, may be more properly inculcated, than those who are
dedicated to the profession of literature. 'Sermons' (1788) no. 8

In this state of temporary honour, a proud man is too willing to exert
his prerogative; and too ready to forget that he is dictating to those,
who may one day dictate to him. 'Sermons' (1788) no. 8 (on

He \[God\] will not leave his promises unfulfilled, nor his threats
unexecuted...Neither can he want power to execute his purposes; he who
spoke, and the world was made, can speak again, and it will perish.

Traveller' (1764) l. 429.

Here falling houses thunder on your head, And here a female atheist
talks you dead. 'London' (1738) l. 17

Of all the griefs that harrass the distressed, Sure the most bitter is a
scornful jest; Fate never wounds more deep the gen'rous heart, Than when
a blockhead's insult points the dart. 'London' (1738) l. 166

This mournful truth is ev'rywhere confessed, Slow rises worth, by
poverty depressed. 'London' (1738) l. 176

Condemned to hope's delusive mine, As on we toil from day to day, By
sudden blasts, or slow decline, Our social comforts drop away. 'On the
Death of Dr Robert Levet' (1783)

When learning's triumph o'er her barb'rous foes First reared the stage,
immortal Shakespeare rose; Each change of many-coloured life he drew,
Exhausted worlds, and then imagined new. 'Prologue spoken at the Opening
of the Theatre in Drury Lane' (1747)

The stage but echoes back the public voice. The drama's laws the drama's
patrons give, For we that live to please, must please to live.

Let observation with extensive view, Survey mankind, from China to Peru.

Deign on the passing world to turn thine eyes, And pause awhile from
letters, to be wise; There mark what ills the scholar's life assail,
Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the jail. 'The Vanity of Human Wishes'

A frame of adamant, a soul of fire, No dangers fright him, and no
labours tire. 'The Vanity of Human Wishes' (1749) l. 193 (on Charles XII
of Sweden)

His fall was destined to a barren strand, A petty fortress, and a
dubious hand; He left the name, at which the world grew pale, To point a
moral, or adorn a tale. 'The Vanity of Human Wishes' (1749) l. 219 (on
Charles XII of Sweden)

Enlarge my life with multitude of days, In health, in sickness, thus the
suppliant prays; Hides from himself his state, and shuns to know, That
life protracted is protracted woe. Time hovers o'er, impatient to
destroy, And shuts up all the passages of joy. 'The Vanity of Human
Wishes' (1749) l. 255

Superfluous lags the vet'ran on the stage. 'The Vanity of Human Wishes'
(1749) l. 308

In life's last scene what prodigies surprise, Fears of the brave, and
follies of the wise? From Marlb'rough's eyes the streams of dotage flow,
And Swift expires a driv'ler and a show. 'The Vanity of Human Wishes'
(1749) l. 315

Must helpless man, in ignorance sedate, Roll darkling down the torrent
of his fate? 'The Vanity of Human Wishes' (1749) l. 345

Still raise for good the supplicating voice, But leave to heaven the
measure and the choice. 'The Vanity of Human Wishes' (1749) l. 351 Page

Winton' (1640)

Weep with me, all you that read This little story, And know, for whom a
tear you shed, Death's self is sorry. 'Twas a child that so did thrive
In grace and feature, As heaven and nature seemed to strive Which owned
the creature. Years he numbered scarce thirteen When Fates turned cruel,
Yet three filled zodiacs had he been The stage's jewel, And did act
(what now we moan) Old men so duly, As, sooth, the Parcae thought him
one, He played so truly. So, by error, to his fate They all consented,
But viewing him since (alas, too late) They have repented; And have
sought, to give new birth, In baths to steep him; But being so much too
good for earth, Heaven vows to keep him. 'Epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a
Child of Queen Elizabeth's Chapel' (1616)

Underneath this stone doth lie As much beauty as could die; Which in
life did harbour give To more virtue than doth live. 'Epitaph on
Elizabeth, L. H.' (1616)

Rest in soft peace, and, asked, say here doth lie Ben Jonson his best
piece of poetry. 'On My First Son' (1616)

This figure that thou here seest put, It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
Wherein the graver had a strife With Nature, to out-do the life: O could
he but have drawn his wit As well in brass, as he has hit His face; the
print would then surpass All that was ever writ in brass: But since he
cannot, reader, look Not on his picture, but his book. On the Portrait
of Shakespeare, from 'Mr William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, and
Tragedies' (1623) 'To the Reader'

Follow a shadow, it still flies you; Seem to fly it, it will pursue: So
court a mistress, she denies you; Let her alone, she will court you.
Say, are not women truly then Styled but the shadows of us men? 'That
Women are but Men's Shadows' (1616)

Drink to me only with thine eyes, And I will pledge with mine; Or leave
a kiss but in the cup, And I'll not look for wine. 'To Celia' (1616)

It is not growing like a tree In bulk, doth make men better be; Or
standing long an oak, three hundred year, To fall a log at last, dry,
bald, and sere: A lily of a day Is fairer far, in May, Although it fall
and die that night; It was the plant and flower of light. In small
proportions we just beauty see, And in short measures life may perfect
be. 'To the Immortal Memory...of...Sir Lucius Carey and Sir H. Morison'
(1640)

Soul of the Age! The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage! My
Shakespeare... Thou art a monument, without a tomb, And art alive still
while thy book doth live, And we have wits to read, and praise to give.
'To the Memory of My Beloved, The Author, Mr William Shakespeare' (1623)

For if I thought my judgement were of years I should commit thee surely
with thy peers: And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine, Or
sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line. 'To the Memory of My Beloved,
The Author, Mr William Shakespeare' (1623)

And though thou hadst small Latin, and less Greek. 'To the Memory of My
Beloved, The Author, Mr William Shakespeare' (1623)

Leave thee alone, for the comparison Of all that insolent Greece or
haughty Rome Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come. 'To the

He was not of an age, but for all time! 'To the Memory of My Beloved,
The Author, Mr William Shakespeare' (1623)

Sweet Swan of Avon! What a sight it were To see thee in our waters yet
appear, And make those flights upon the banks of Thames That so did take
Eliza, and our James! 'To the Memory of My Beloved, The Author, Mr

Thou art not, Penshurst, built to envious show Of touch or marble, nor
canst boast a row

Of polished pillars, or a roof of gold; Thou hast no lantern whereof
tales are told, Or stair, or courts; but standst an ancient pile, And
these grudged at, art reverenced the while. 'To Penshurst' (1616) l. 1

The blushing apricot and woolly peach Hang on thy walls, that every

His censure of the English poets was this...That Donne, for not keeping

The players have often mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare that in
his writing, whatsoever he penned, he never blotted out a line. My
answer hath been 'Would he had blotted a thousand'; which they thought a
malevolent speech. I had not told posterity this, but for their
ignorance, who chose that circumstance to commend their friend by
wherein he most faulted...His wit was in his own power; would the rule
of it had been so too...But he redeemed his vices with his virtues.
There was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned. 'Timber,

10.51 James Joyce 1882-1941 Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was
general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark
central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of
Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous
Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely
churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly
drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the
little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard
the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like
the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.

By an epiphany he meant a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether in

10.56 Carl Gustav Jung 1875-1961 Eine gewissermassen oberflächliche
Schicht des Unbewussten ist zweifellos persönlich. Wir nennen sie das
persönliche Unbewusste. Dieses ruht aber auf einer tieferen Schicht,
welche nicht mehr persönlicher Erfahrung und Erwerbung entstammt,
sondern angeboren ist. Diese tiefere Schicht ist das sogenannte
kollektive Unbewusste...Die Inhalte des persönlichen Unbewussten sind in
der Hauptsache die sogenannten gefühlsbetonten Komplexe...Die Inhalte
des kollektiven Unbewussten dagegen sind die sogenannten Archetypen. A
more or less superficial layer of the unconscious is undoubtedly
personal. I call it the personal unconscious. But this personal
unconscious rests upon a deeper layer, which does not derive from
personal experience and is not a personal acquisition but is inborn.
This deeper layer I call the collective unconscious...The contents of
the personal unconscious are chiefly the feelingtoned complexes...The
contents of the collective unconscious, on the other hand, are known as
archetypes. 'Eranos Jahrbuch' (1934) p. 180

Wo die Liebe herrscht, da gibt es keinen Machtwillen, und wo die Macht

realization of the innate individuality of a particular living being.
Personality is an act of the greatest courage in the face of life, the

coupled with the greatest possible freedom of personal decision.

The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a man
is healthy; but there is a space of life between, in which the soul is
in a ferment, the character undecided, the way of life uncertain, the
ambition thick-sighted: thence proceeds mawkishness. 'Endymion' (1818)
preface

A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: Its loveliness increases; it will
never Pass into nothingness; but still will keep A bower quiet for us,
and a sleep Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.

They alway must be with us, or we die. 'Endymion' (1818) bk. 1, l. 33

Who, of men, can tell That flowers would bloom, or that green fruit
would swell To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail, The earth
its dower of river, wood, and vale, The meadows runnels, runnels
pebble-stones, The seed its harvest, or the lute its tones, Tones
ravishment, or ravishment its sweet, If human souls did never kiss and
greet? 'Endymion' (1818) bk. 1, l. 835

Here is wine, Alive with sparkles---never, I aver, Since Ariadne was a

And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep, In blanchéd linen, smooth,
and lavendered, While he from forth the closet brought a heap Of candied
apple, quince, and plum, and gourd; With jellies soother than the creamy
curd, And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon; Manna and dates, in argosy
transferred From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one, From silken
Samarcand to cedared Lebanon. 'The Eve of St Agnes' (1820) st. 30

In drear nighted December Too happy, happy tree Thy branches ne'er

Was never said in rhyme. 'In drear nighted December' (written 1817)

And she forgot the stars, the moon,and sun, And she forgot the blue
above the trees, And she forgot the dells where waters run, And she
forgot the chilly autumn breeze; She had no knowledge when the day was
done, And the new morn she saw not: but in peace Hung over her sweet
Basil evermore, And moistened it with tears unto the core. 'Isabella;

immortal dream. 'Lamia' (1820) pt. 1, l. 127

That purple-linéd palace of sweet sin. 'Lamia' (1820) pt. 2, l. 31

In pale contented sort of discontent. 'Lamia' (1820) pt. 2, l. 135

Do not all charms fly At the mere touch of cold philosophy? There was an
awful rainbow once in heaven: We know her woof, her texture; she is
given In the dull catalogue of common things. Philosophy will clip an
Angel's wings. 'Lamia' (1820) pt. 2, l. 229

What men or gods are these? What maidens loth? What mad pursuit? What
struggle to escape? What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy? 'Ode on
a Grecian Urn' (1820) st. 1

Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard Are sweeter; therefore, ye
soft pipes, play on; Not to the sensual ear, but, more endeared, Pipe to
the spirit ditties of no tone. 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' (1820) st. 2

For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair! 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' (1820)

For ever warm and still to be enjoyed, For ever panting, and for ever
young; All breathing human passion far above, That leaves a heart
high-sorrowful and cloyed, A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.
'Ode on a Grecian Urn' (1820) st. 3

Who are these coming to the sacrifice? To what green altar, O mysterious
priest, Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies, And all her silken
flanks with garlands dressed? What little town by river or sea shore, Or
mountain-built with peaceful citadel, Is emptied of this folk, this
pious morn? 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' (1820) st. 4

No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for
its poisonous wine. 'Ode on Melancholy' (1820) st. 1

Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be Your mournful Psyche. 'Ode on
Melancholy' (1820) st. 1

But when the melancholy fit shall fall Sudden from heaven like a weeping
cloud, That fosters the droop-headed flowers all, And hides the green
hill in an April shroud; Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose, Or on
the rainbow of the salt sand-wave, Or on the wealth of globéd peonies;
Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,

Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave, And feed deep, deep upon her
peerless eyes. 'Ode on Melancholy' (1820) st. 2

She dwells with Beauty---Beauty that must die; And Joy, whose hand is
ever at his lips Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh, Turning to
poison while the bee-mouth sips: Ay, in the very temple of Delight
Veiled Melancholy has her sovran shrine, Though seen of none save him
whose strenuous tongue Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
His soul shall taste the sadness of her might, And be among her cloudy
trophies hung. 'Ode on Melancholy' (1820) st. 3

My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains My sense, as though of
hemlock I had drunk, Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains One
minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk: 'Tis not through envy of thy
happy lot, But being too happy in thine happiness,--- That thou,
light-wingéd Dryad of the trees, In some melodious plot Of beechen
green, and shadows numberless, Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
'Ode to a Nightingale' (1820) st. 1

O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been Cooled a long age in the
deep-delvéd earth, Tasting of Flora and the country green, Dance, and
Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth! O for a beaker full of the warm
South, Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene, With beaded bubbles
winking at the brim, And purple-stainéd mouth; That I might drink, and
leave the world unseen, And with thee fade away into the forest dim.
'Ode to a Nightingale' (1820) st. 2

Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget What thou among the leaves
hast never known, The weariness, the fever, and the fret Here, where men
sit and hear each other groan;

Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last grey hairs, Where youth grows pale,
and spectre-thin, and dies; Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
And leaden-eyed despairs. 'Ode to a Nightingale' (1820) st. 3

Away! away! for I will fly to thee, Not charioted by Bacchus and his
pards, But on the viewless wings of Poesy, Though the dull brain
perplexes and retards: Already with thee! tender is the night. 'Ode to a
Nightingale' (1820) st. 4

I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, Nor what soft incense hangs
upon the boughs. 'Ode to a Nightingale' (1820) st. 5

Fast fading violets covered up in leaves; And mid-May's eldest child,
The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine, The murmurous haunt of flies on
summer eves. 'Ode to a Nightingale' (1820) st. 5

Darkling I listen; and, for many a time I have been half in love with
easeful Death, Called him soft names in many a muséd rhyme, To take into
the air my quiet breath; Now more than ever seems it rich to die, To
cease upon the midnight with no pain. 'Ode to a Nightingale' (1820) st.
6

Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird! No hungry generations tread
thee down; The voice I hear this passing night was heard In ancient days
by emperor and clown: Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home, She stood in tears
amid the alien corn; The same that oft-times hath Charmed magic
casements, opening on the foam Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
'Ode to a Nightingale' (1820) st. 7

Forlorn! the very word is like a bell To toll me back from thee to my
sole self! Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well

As she is famed to do, deceiving elf. 'Ode to a Nightingale' (1820) st.
8

Was it a vision, or a waking dream? Fled is that music:---do I wake or
sleep? 'Ode to a Nightingale' (1820) st. 8

'Mid hushed, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed, Blue, silver-white, and
budded Tyrian. 'Ode to Psyche' (1820) st. 1

Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan Upon the midnight hours. 'Ode to
Psyche' (1820) st. 2

Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane In some untrodden region of
my mind, Where branchéd thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain, Instead
of pines shall murmur in the wind. 'Ode to Psyche' (1820) st. 4

A bright torch, and a casement ope at night, To let the warm Love in!
'Ode to Psyche' (1820) st. 4

Much have I travelled in the realms of gold, And many goodly states and
kingdoms seen. 'On First Looking into Chapman's Homer' (1817)

Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into
his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes He stared at the
Pacific---and all his men Looked at each other with a wild surmise---
Silent, upon a peak in Darien. 'On First Looking into Chapman's Homer'
(1817)

Mortality Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep. 'On Seeing the
Elgin Marbles' (1817)

The poetry of earth is never dead: When all the birds are faint with the
hot sun, And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run From hedge to hedge
about the new-mown mead. 'On the Grasshopper and Cricket' (1817)

It keeps eternal whisperings around Desolate shores,---and with its
mighty swell Gluts twice ten thousand Caverns.

'On the Sea' (1817)

Yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind, Whose words are images of
thoughts refined, Is my soul's pleasure; and it sure must be Almost the
highest bliss of human-kind, When to thy haunts two kindred spirits
flee. 'O Solitude! if I must with thee dwell' (1817)

O fret not after knowledge---I have none, And yet my song comes native
with the warmth. O fret not after knowledge---I have none, And yet the
Evening listens. 'O thou whose face hath felt the winter's wind'
(written 1818)

Dry your eyes---O dry your eyes For I was taught in Paradise To ease my
breast of melodies. 'Shed no tear---O shed no tear' (written 1819)

Stop and consider! life is but a day; A fragile dew-drop on its perilous
way From a tree's summit; a poor Indian's sleep While his boat hastens
to the monstrous steep Of Montmorenci. 'Sleep and Poetry' (1817) l. 85

O for ten years, that I may overwhelm Myself in poesy; so I may do the
deed That my own soul has to itself decreed. 'Sleep and Poetry' (1817)
l. 96

They swayed about upon a rocking horse, And thought it Pegasus. 'Sleep
and Poetry' (1817) l. 186

And they shall be accounted poet kings Who simply tell the most
heart-easing things. 'Sleep and Poetry' (1817) l. 267

O soft embalmer of the still midnight, Shutting, with careful fingers
and benign Our gloom-pleased eyes. 'Sonnet to Sleep' (written 1819)

Turn the key deftly in the oiléd wards, And seal the hushéd casket of my
soul. 'Sonnet to Sleep' (written 1819)

This living hand, now warm and capable

Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold And in the icy silence of
the tomb, So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights That thou
wouldst wish thine own heart dry of blood So in my veins red life might
stream again, And thus be conscience-calmed---see here it is I hold it
towards you. 'This living hand, now warm and capable' (written 1819)

Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, Close bosom-friend of the
maturing sun; Conspiring with him how to load and bless With fruit the
vines that round the thatch-eaves run. 'To Autumn' (1820) st. 1

Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store? Sometimes whoever seeks
abroad may find Thee sitting careless on a granary floor, Thy hair
soft-lifted by the winnowing wind; Or on a half-reaped furrow sound
asleep, Drowsed with the fume of poppies while thy hook Spares the next
swath and all its twinéd flowers. 'To Autumn' (1820) st. 2

Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they? Think not of them,
thou hast thy music too. 'To Autumn' (1820) st. 3

Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn Among the river sallows,
borne aloft Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies. 'To Autumn'
(1820) st. 3

The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft; And gathering swallows
twitter in the skies. 'To Autumn' (1820) st. 3

Oh Chatterton! how very sad thy fate! Dear child of sorrow! son of
misery! How soon the film of death obscured that eye, Whence genius
wildly flashed. 'To Chatterton' (written 1815)

Sweet are the pleasures that to verse belong, And doubly sweet a
brotherhood in song. 'To George Felton Mathew' (1817) l. 1

Aye on the shores of darkness there is light,

And precipices show untrodden green, There is a budding morrow in
midnight, There is a triple sight in blindness keen. 'To Homer' (written
1818)

It is a flaw In happiness, to see beyond our bourn--- It forces us in
summer skies to mourn: It spoils the singing of the nightingale. 'To J.
H. Reynolds, Esq.' (written 1818)

Glory and loveliness have passed away. 'To Leigh Hunt, Esq.' (1817)

To one who has been long in city pent, 'Tis very sweet to look into the
fair And open face of heaven. 'To one who has been long in city pent'

When I have fears that I may cease to be Before my pen has gleaned my
teeming brain. 'When I have fears that I may cease to be' (written 1818)

When I behold, upon the night's starred face Huge cloudy symbols of a
high romance. 'When I have fears that I may cease to be' (written 1818)

Then on the shore Of the wide world I stand alone and think Till love
and fame to nothingness do sink. 'When I have fears that I may cease to
be' (written 1818)

Woman! when I behold thee flippant, vain, Inconstant, childish, proud,
and full of fancies. 'Woman! when I behold thee flippant, vain' (1817)

I remember your saying that you had notions of a good genius presiding
over you---I have of late had the same thought. For things which \[I\]
do half at random are afterwards confirmed by my judgement in a dozen
features of propriety---Is it too daring to fancy Shakespeare this
presider? Letter to B. R. Haydon, 10 May 1817, in H. E. Rollins (ed.)
'The Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 141

A long poem is a test of invention which I take to be the polar star of
poetry, as fancy is the sails, and imagination the rudder. Letter to
Benjamin Bailey, 8 October 1817, in H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters of
John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 170

A man should have the fine point of his soul taken off to become fit for
this world. Letter to J. H. Reynolds, 22 November 1817, in H. E. Rollins
(ed.) 'The Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 188

I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the heart's affections and
the truth of imagination---

what the imagination seizes as beauty must be truth---whether it existed
before or not. Letter to Benjamin Bailey, 22 November 1817, in H. E.
Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 184.

I have never yet been able to perceive how anything can be known for
truth by consecutive reasoning---and yet it must be. Letter to Benjamin

Bailey, 22 November 1817, in H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters of John
Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 185

The excellence of every art is its intensity, capable of making all
disagreeables evaporate, from their being in close relationship with
beauty and truth. Letter to George and Thomas Keats, 21 December 1817,
in H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 192

Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in
uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after
fact and reason---Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine
isolated verisimilitude caught from the penetralium of mystery, from
being incapable of remaining content with half knowledge. Letter to
George and Thomas Keats, 21 December 1817, in H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The
Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 194

There is nothing stable in the world---uproar's your only music. Letter

For the sake of a few fine imaginative or domestic passages, are we to
be bullied into a certain philosophy engendered in the whims of an
egotist? Letter to J. H. Reynolds, 3 February 1818, in H. E. Rollins
(ed.) 'The Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 223; on the
overbearing influence of Wordsworth upon his contemporaries

We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us---and if we do not
agree, seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket. Poetry should be
great and unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does
not startle it or amaze it with itself, but with its subject. Letter to
J. H. Reynolds, 3 February 1818, in H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters of
John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 224

Poetry should surprise by a fine excess, and not by singularity---it
should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and
appear almost a remembrance. Letter to John Taylor, 27 February 1818, in
H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 238

Its \[poetry's\] touches of beauty should never be half way, thereby
making the reader breathless, instead of content...If poetry comes not
as naturally as the leaves to a tree it had better not come at all.
Letter to John Taylor, 27 February 1818, in H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The
Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 238

It is impossible to live in a country which is continually under
hatches....Rain! Rain! Rain! Letter to J. H. Reynolds from Devon, 10

vol. 1, p. 269

I have been hovering for some time between an exquisite sense of the
luxurious and a love for philosophy---were I calculated for the former I
should be glad---but as I am not I shall turn all my soul to the latter.
Letter to John Taylor, 24 April 1818, in H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The
Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 271

Axioms in philosophy are not axioms until they are proved upon our
pulses: We read fine--- things, but never feel them to the full until we
have gone the same steps as the author. Letter to J. H. Reynolds, 3 May
1818, in H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1,
p. 279

I am in that temper that if I were under water I would scarcely kick to
come to the top. Letter to Benjamin Bailey, 25 May 1818, in H. E.

I do think better of womankind than to suppose they care whether Mister
John Keats five feet high likes them or not. Letter to Benjamin Bailey,

vol. 1, p. 342

I wish I could say Tom was any better. His identity presses upon me so
all day that I am obliged to go out. Referring to his youngest brother

In Endymion, I leaped headlong into the sea, and thereby have become
better acquainted with the soundings, the quicksands, and the rocks,
than if I had stayed upon the green shore, and piped a silly pipe, and
took tea and comfortable advice. Letter to James Hessey, 8 October 1818,
in H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 374

I would sooner fail than not be among the greatest. Letter to James
Hessey, 8 October 1818, in H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters of John
Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 374

As to the poetical character itself, (I mean that sort of which, if I am
any thing, I am a member; that sort distinguished from the Wordsworthian
or egotistical sublime; which is a thing per se and stands alone) it is
not itself---it has no self....It has as much delight in conceiving an
Iago as an Imogen. Letter to Richard Woodhouse, 27 October 1818, in H.
E. Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 386

A poet is the most unpoetical of any thing in existence, because he has
no identity; he is continually in for---and filling some other body.

'The Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 1, p. 387

A man's life of any worth is a continual allegory. Letter to George and
Georgiana Keats, 19 February 1819, in H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters

I have come to this resolution---never to write for the sake of writing,
or making a poem, but from running over with any little knowledge or
experience which many years of reflection may perhaps give
me---otherwise I shall be dumb. Letter to B. R. Haydon, 8 March 1819, in
H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 2, p. 43

It is true that in the height of enthusiasm I have been cheated into

p. 43

I go among the fields and catch a glimpse of a stoat or a fieldmouse
peeping out of the withered grass---The creature hath a purpose and its
eyes are bright with it---I go amongst the buildings of a city and I see
a man hurrying along---to what? The Creature has a purpose and his eyes
are bright with it. Letter to George and Georgiana Keats, 19 March 1819,
in H. E. Rollins (ed.) 'The Letters of John Keats' (1958) vol. 2, p. 80

accepting the Democratic nomination in Los Angeles, 15 July 1960, in
'Vital Speeches' 1 August 1960, p. 611

Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike,
that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans---born
in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter
peace, proud of our ancient heritage---and unwilling to witness or
permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has
always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and
around the world. Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or
ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,
support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the
success of liberty. Inaugural address, 20 January 1961, in 'Vital

Now the trumpet summons us again---not as a call to bear arms, though
arms we need---not as a call to battle, though embattled we are---but a
call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year
out, 'rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation'---a struggle against
the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself.

And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for

Speeches' 1 February 1961, p. 227. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., speaking

When power leads man toward arrogance, poetry reminds him of his
limitations. When power narrows the areas of man's concern, poetry
reminds him of the richness and diversity of his existence. When power
corrupts, poetry cleanses. For art establishes the basic human truths
which must serve as the touchstone of our judgement. Speech at Amherst
College, Mass., 26 October 1963, in 'New York Times' 27 October 1963,
p. 87

In free society art is not a weapon...Artists are not engineers of the

He felt about France what Pericles felt of Athens---unique value in her,
nothing else mattering; but his theory of politics was Bismarck's. He
had one illusion---France; and one disillusion--- mankind, including
Frenchmen, and his colleagues not least. 'The Economic Consequences of
the Peace' (1919) ch. 3 (on Clemenceau)

Like Odysseus, the President looked wiser when he was seated. 'The
Economic Consequences of the Peace' (1919) ch. 3 (on Woodrow Wilson)

Lenin was right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the
existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process
engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of
destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is
able to diagnose. 'The Economic Consequences of the Peace' (1919) ch. 6

I do not know which makes a man more conservative---to know nothing but
the present, or nothing but the past. 'The End of Laissez-Faire' (1926)
pt. 1

Marxian Socialism must always remain a portent to the historians of
opinion---how a doctrine so illogical and so dull can have exercised so
powerful and enduring an influence over the minds of men, and, through
them, the events of history. 'The End of Laissez-Faire' (1926) pt. 3

The important thing for Government is not to do things which individuals
are doing already,

and to do them a little better or a little worse; but to do those things
which at present are not done at all. 'The End of Laissez-Faire' (1926)
pt. 4

I think that capitalism, wisely managed, can probably be made more
efficient for attaining economic ends than any alternative system yet in
sight, but that in itself it is in many ways extremely objectionable.
'The End of Laissez-Faire' (1926) pt. 5

bard, this half-human visitor to our age from the hag-ridden magic and
enchanted woods of Celtic antiquity. 'Essays in Biography' (1933) 'Mr
Lloyd George'

The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are
right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly
understood...Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt
from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct
economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are
distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years
back. 'The General Theory of Employment' (1947 ed.) ch. 24

11.29 Nikita Khrushchev 1894-1971 If anyone believes that our smiles
involve abandonment of the teaching of Marx, Engels and Lenin he
deceives himself. Those who wait for that must wait until a shrimp
learns to whistle. Speech in Moscow, 17 September 1955, in 'New York
Times' 18 September 1955, p. 19

We say this not only for the socialist states, who are more akin to us.
We base ourselves on the idea that we must peacefully co-exist. About
the capitalist States, it doesn't depend on you whether or not we exist.
If you don't like us, don't accept our invitations and don't invite us
to come to see you. Whether you like it or not, history is on our side.
We will bury you. Speech to Western diplomats at reception in Moscow for
Polish leader Mr Gomulka, 18 November 1956, in 'The Times' 19 November
1956

Anyone who believes that the worker can be lulled by fine revolutionary
phrases is mistaken.... If no concern is shown for the growth of
material and spiritual riches, the people will listen today, they will
listen tomorrow, and then they may say: 'Why do you promise us
everything for the future? You are talking, so to speak, about life
beyond the grave. The priest has already told us about this.' Speech at
World Youth Forum, 19 September 1964, in 'Pravda' 22 September 1964

terrific as to stop the church clock. W. Plomer (ed.) 'Selections from

It is a fine thing to be out on the hills alone. A man can hardly be a
beast or a fool alone on a great mountain. W. Plomer (ed.) 'Selections

11.33 Benjamin Franklin King 1857-94 Nothing to do but work, Nothing to

but off, Nowhere to stand but on. 'The Pessimist'

Nowhere to go but out, Nowhere to come but back. 'The Pessimist'

11.34 Henry King 1592-1669

Sleep on (my Love!) in thy cold bed Never to be disquieted. My last
Good-night! Thou wilt not wake Till I thy fate shall overtake: Till age,
or grief, or sickness must Marry my body to that dust It so much loves;
and fill the room My heart keeps empty in thy tomb. Stay for me there: I
will not fail To meet thee in that hollow vale. And think not much of my
delay; I am already on the way, And follow thee with all the speed
Desire can make, or sorrows breed. 'An Exequy' l. 81 (written for his
wife Anne who died in 1624)

But hark! My pulse, like a soft drum Beats my approach, tells thee I
come; And, slow howe'er my marches be, I shall at last sit down by thee.
The thought of this bids me go on, And wait my dissolution With hope and
comfort. Dear! (forgive The crime) I am content to live Divided, with
but half a heart, Till we shall meet and never part. 'An Exequy' l. 111
(written for his wife Anne who died in 1624)

We that did nothing study but the way To love each other, with which
thoughts the day Rose with delight to us, and with them set, Must learn
the hateful art, how to forget. 'The Surrender'

Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. Letter from
Birmingham Jail, Alabama, 16 April 1963, in 'Atlantic Monthly' August
1963, p. 78

The Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not
the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white
moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a
negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which
is

the presence of justice. Letter from Birmingham Jail, Alabama, 16 April
1963, in 'Atlantic Monthly' August 1963, p. 81

I submit to you that if a man hasn't discovered something he will die
for, he isn't fit to live. Speech in Detroit, 23 June 1963, in James
Bishop 'The Days of Martin Luther King' (1971) ch. 4

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of
former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit
down together at the table of brotherhood... I have a dream that my four
little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be
judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
Speech at Civil Rights March in Washington, 28 August 1963, in 'New York

I just want to do God's will. And he's allowed me to go up to the

11.36 Stoddard King 1889-1933 There's a long, long trail awinding Into

'O Mary, go and call the cattle home, And call the cattle home, And call
the cattle home, Across the sands of Dee.' The western wind was wild and
dank with foam, And all alone went she. 'The Sands of Dee'

The western tide crept up along the sand, And o'er and o'er the sand,
And round and round the sand, As far as eye could see. The rolling mist
came down and hid the land: And never home came she. 'The Sands of Dee'

Three fishers went sailing away to the west, Away to the west as the sun
went down; Each thought on the woman who loved him the best,

And the children stood watching them out of the town. 'The Three
Fishers'

For men must work, and women must weep, And there's little to earn, and
many to keep, Though the harbour bar be moaning. 'The Three Fishers'

When all the world is young, lad, And all the trees are green; And every
goose a swan, lad, And every lass a queen; Then hey for boot and horse,
lad, And round the world away: Young blood must have its course, lad,
And every dog his day. 'Young and Old' (from 'The Water Babies', 1863)

To be discontented with the divine discontent, and to be ashamed with
the noble shame, is the very germ and first upgrowth of all virtue.

twenty-two, A clean upstanding chap like you? Sure, if your throat 'tis

That's cured by hanging from a string. 'Two Poems, after A. E. Housman'

'Tis Summer Time on Bredon, And now the farmers swear:

sick. 'Two Poems, after A. E. Housman' (1933) no. 2

11.40 Rudyard Kipling 1865-1936 When you've shouted 'Rule Britannia',
when you've sung 'God save the Queen'--- When you've finished killing
Kruger with your mouth--- Will you kindly drop a shilling in my little
tambourine For a gentleman in Kharki ordered South? He's an
absent-minded beggar and his weaknesses are great--- But we and Paul
must take him as we find him--- He is out on active service, wiping
something off a slate--- And he's left a lot o' little things behind
him! 'The Absent-Minded Beggar' (1899) st. 1

Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet, Till
Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgement Seat; But there

men stand face to face, tho' they come from the ends of earth!

For they're hangin' Danny Deever, you can hear the Dead March play, The

Deever in the mornin'. 'Danny Deever' (1892)

Yah! Bah! 'Gentlemen-Rankers' (1892)

Our England is a garden, and such gardens are not made By
singing:---'Oh, how beautiful!' and sitting in the shade, While better
men than we go out and start their working lives At grubbing weeds from
gravel paths with broken dinner-knives. 'The Glory of the Garden' (1911)

As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man--- There are

By the old Moulmein Pagoda, lookin' eastward to the sea,

There's a Burma girl a-settin', and I know she thinks o' me; For the
wind is in the palm-trees, an' the temple-bells they say: 'Come you
back, you British soldier; come you back to Mandalay!' Come you back to
Mandalay, Where the old flotilla lay: Can't you 'ear their paddles
chunkin' from Rangoon to Mandalay? On the road to Mandalay, Where the
flyin'-fishes play, An' the dawn comes up like thunder outer China
'crost the Bay! 'Mandalay' (1892)

If, drunk with sight of power, we loose Wild tongues that have not Thee

the Law. 'Recessional' (1897)

If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and
blaming it on you; If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But
make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired
by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated,
don't give way to hating,

And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; If you can dream---and
not make dreams your master; If you can think---and not make thoughts
your aim, If you can meet with triumph and disaster And treat those two
imposters just the same... 'Rewards and Fairies' (1910) 'If---'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with
Kings---nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends
can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can
fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And---which is
more---you'll be a Man, my son! 'Rewards and Fairies' (1910) 'If---'

Who hath desired the Sea?---the sight of salt water unbounded--- The
heave and the halt and the hurl and the crash of the comber
wind-hounded? The sleek-barrelled swell before storm, grey, foamless,

If the husband be a man with whom you have lived on a friendly footing
before marriage,---if you did not come in on the wife's side,---if you
did not sneak into the house in her train, but were an old friend in
first habits of intimacy before their courtship was so much as thought
on,---look about you...Every long friendship, every old authentic
intimacy, must be brought into their office to be new stamped with their
currency, as a sovereign Prince calls in the good old money that was

coined in some reign before he was born or thought of, to be new marked
and minted with the stamp of his authority, before he will let it pass
current in the world. 'Essays of Elia' (1823) 'A Bachelor's Complaint of
the Behaviour of Married People'

Ceremony is an invention to take off the uneasy feeling which we derive
from knowing ourselves to be less the object of love and esteem with a
fellow-creature than some other person is. It endeavours to make up, by

Curse the blasted, jelly-boned swines, the slimy, the belly-wriggling
invertebrates, the miserable sodding rotters, the flaming sods, the
snivelling, dribbling, dithering, palsied, pulse-less lot that make up
England today. They've got white of egg in their veins, and their spunk
is that watery it's a marvel they can breed. They can nothing but
frog-spawn---the gibberers! God, how I hate them! Letter to Edward

The autumn always gets me badly, as it breaks into colours. I want to go

I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations, and with no

First Inaugural Address, 4 March 1861

This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit
it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can
exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their
revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. First Inaugural
Address, 4 March 1861

Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history...No personal significance or
insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through
which we pass will light us down in honour or dishonour to the last
generation. Annual Message to Congress, 1 December 1862

In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the
free---honourable alike in what we give and what we preserve. We shall
nobly save or meanly lose the last, best hope of earth. Annual Message
to Congress, 1 December 1862

Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war
may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the
wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited
toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash
shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three
thousand years ago, so still it must be said, 'The judgements of the
Lord are true and righteous altogether.' Second Inaugural Address, 4
March 1865

With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the
right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the
work we are in: to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who
shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan, to do all
which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves,
and with all nations. Second Inaugural Address, 4 March 1865

Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this
continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal...In a larger sense we cannot
dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave
men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above
our power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long
remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is
rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before
us, that from these honoured dead we take increased devotion to that
cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we
here highly resolve that the dead shall not have died in vain, that this
nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and

that government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall
not perish from the earth. Address at the Dedication of the National
Cemetery at Gettysburg, 19 November 1863, as reported the following day;
the Lincoln Memorial inscription reads 'by the people, for the people'.

I think the necessity of being ready increases.---Look to it. The whole
of a letter to Governor Andrew Curtin of Pennsylvania, 8 April 1861

My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union...If I could
save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could
save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could save it
by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that...I have
here stated my purpose according to my views of official duty and I
intend no modification of my oftexpressed personal wish that all men
everywhere could be free. Letter to Horace Greeley, 22 August 1862

I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events
have controlled me. Letter to A. G. Hodges, 4 April 1864

The commonwealth of learning is not at this time without
master-builders, whose mighty designs, in advancing the sciences, will

(1690) bk. 4, ch. 7, sect. 11

There are very few lovers of truth, for truth-sake, even among those who
persuade themselves that they are so. How a man may know, whether he be
so, in earnest, is worth enquiry; and I think, there is this one
unerring mark of it, viz. the not entertaining any proposition with
greater

assurance than the proof it is built on will warrant. Whoever goes
beyond this measure of assent, it is plain, receives not truth in the
love of it, loves not truth for truth-sake, but for some other byend.

Hour. 'The Children's Hour' (1859)

The cares that infest the day Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs,
And as silently steal away. 'The Day is Done' (1844)

I remember the black wharves and the slips, And the sea-rides tossing
free; And Spanish sailors with bearded lips, And the beauty and mystery

Not in the clamour of the crowded street, Not in the shouts and plaudits
of the throng, But in ourselves, are triumph and defeat. 'The Poets'
(1876)

Tell me not, in mournful numbers, Life is but an empty dream! For the
soul is dead that slumbers, And things are not what they seem. Life is
real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to
dust returnest, Was not spoken of the soul. 'A Psalm of Life' (1838).

Art is long, and Time is fleeting, And our hearts, though stout and

By the shore of Gitche Gumee, By the shining Big-Sea-Water, Stood the
wigwam of Nokomis, Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis. Dark behind it rose
the forest, Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees, Rose the firs with

A hurry of hoofs in a village street, A shape in the moonlight, a bulk
in the dark, And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark Struck
out from a steed flying fearless and fleet: That was all! And yet,
through the gloom and the light, The fate of a nation was riding that
night. 'Tales of a Wayside Inn' pt. 1 (1863) 'The Landlord's Tale: Paul

Forbear, thou great good husband, little ant. 'The Ant'

When Love with unconfined wings Hovers within my gates; And my divine
Althea brings To whisper at the grates: When I lie tangled in her hair,
And fettered to her eye; The Gods, that wanton in the air Know no such
liberty. 'To Althea, From Prison'

From Prison'

When thirsty grief in wine we steep, When healths and draughts go free,

Fishes, that tipple in the deep, Know no such liberty. 'To Althea, From

Stone walls do not a prison make Nor iron bars a cage; Minds innocent
and quiet take That for an hermitage; If I have freedom in my love, And
in my soul am free; Angels alone, that soar above, Enjoy such liberty.
'To Althea, From Prison'

If to be absent were to be Away from thee; Or that when I am gone, You

wind, or swallowing wave. 'To Lucasta, Going Beyond the Seas'

Tell me not, Sweet, I am unkind, That from the nunnery Of thy chaste
breast, and quiet mind, To war and arms I fly. True; a new mistress now
I chase, The first foe in the field; And with a stronger faith embrace A
sword, a horse, a shield. Yet this inconstancy is such, As you too shall
adore; I could not love thee, Dear, so much, Loved I not honour more.

quibus ipse malis careas quia cernere suave est.

Suave etiam belli certamina magna tueri Per campos instructa tua sine
parte pericli. Sed nil dulcius est, bene quam munita tenere Edita
doctrina sapientum templa serena, Despicere unde queas alios passimque
videre Errare atque viam palantis quaerere vitae, Certare ingenio,
contendere nobilitate, Noctes atque dies niti praestante labore Ad
summas emergere opes rerumque potiri. Lovely it is, when the winds are
churning up the waves on the great sea, to gaze out from the land on the
great efforts of someone else; not because it's an enjoyable pleasure
that somebody is in difficulties, but because it's lovely to realize
what troubles you are yourself spared. Lovely also to witness great
battle-plans of war, carried out across the plains, without your having
any share in the danger. But nothing is sweeter than to occupy the quiet
precincts that are well protected by the teachings of the wise, from
where you can look down on others and see them wandering all over the
place, getting lost and seeking the way in life, striving by their wits,
pitting their noble birth, by night and by day struggling by superior
efforts to rise to power at the top and make all theirs. 'De Rerum
Natura' bk. 2, l. 1

Augescunt aliae gentes, aliae minuntur, Inque brevi spatio mutantur
saecla animantum Et quasi cursores vitai lampada tradunt. Some races
increase, others are reduced, and in a short while the generations of
living creatures are changed and like runners relay the torch of life.
'De Rerum Natura' bk. 2, l. 7

Nil igitur mors est ad nos neque pertinet hilum, Quandoquidem natura

concern us a scrap, seeing that the nature of the spirit we possess is
something mortal. 'De Rerum Natura' bk. 3, l. 830

Scire licet nobis nil esse in morte timendum Nec miserum fieri qui non
est posse neque hilum Differre an nullo fuerit iam tempore natus,
Mortalem vitam mors cum immortalis ademit. We can know there is nothing
to be feared in death, that one who is not cannot be made unhappy, and
that it matters not a scrap whether one might ever have been born at
all, when death that is immortal has taken over one's mortal life. 'De
Rerum Natura' bk. 3, l. 866

territories. It is under the jurisdiction of two hostile powers; and
like other districts similarly situated it is ill-defined,
illcultivated, and ill-regulated. Instead of being equally shared
between its two rulers, the Reason and the Imagination, it falls
alternately under the sole and absolute dominion of each. It is
sometimes fiction. It is sometimes theory. 'History' in 'Edinburgh

It's no go the picture palace, it's no go the stadium, It's no go the
country cot with a pot of pink geraniums, It's no go the Government
grants, it's no go the elections, Sit on your arse for fifty years and
hang your hat on a pension. 'Bagpipe Music' (1938)

It's no go my honey love, it's no go my poppet; Work your hands from day
to day, the winds will blow the profit. The glass is falling hour by
hour, the glass will fall for ever, But if you break the bloody glass
you won't hold up the weather. 'Bagpipe Music' (1938)

And under the totem poles---the ancient terror--- Between the enormous
fluted Ionic columns There seeps from heavily jowled or hawk-like
foreign faces The guttural sorrow of the refugees. 'The British Museum
Reading Room' (1941)

Crumbling between the fingers, under the feet, Crumbling behind the
eyes, Their world gives way and dies And something twangs and breaks at
the end of the street. 'Dèbâcle' (1941)

Time was away and somewhere else,

There were two glasses and two chairs And two people with the one pulse
(Somebody stopped the moving stairs): Time was away and somewhere else.
'Meeting Point'

I am not yet born; O fill me With strength against those who would
freeze my humanity, would dragoon me into a lethal automaton, would make
me a cog in a machine, a thing with one face, a thing, and against all
those who would dissipate my entirety, would blow me like thistledown
hither and thither or hither and thither like water held in the hands
would spill me. Let them not make me a stone and let them not spill me,
Otherwise kill me. 'Prayer Before Birth' (1944)

World is crazier and more of it than we think, Incorrigibly plural. I
peel and portion A tangerine and spit the pips and feel The drunkenness
of things being various. 'Snow' (1935)

Down the road someone is practising scales, The notes like little fishes
vanish with a wink of tails, Man's heart expands to tinker with his car
For this is Sunday morning, Fate's great bazaar. 'Sunday Morning' (1935)

The sunlight on the garden Hardens and grows cold, We cannot cage the
minute Within its net of gold, When all is told We cannot beg for
pardon. 'Sunlight on the Garden' (1938)

Our freedom as free lances Advances towards its end; The earth compels,
upon it Sonnets and birds descend; And soon, my friend,

We shall have no time for dances. 'Sunlight on the Garden' (1938)

So they were married---to be the more together--- And found they were
never again so much together, Divided by the morning tea, By the evening
paper, By children and tradesmen's bills. 'Les Sylphides' (1941)

By a high star our course is set, Our end is Life. Put out to sea.

Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an ailment without which it
instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty,
which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction than
it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to
animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency. 'The
Federalist' (1787) no. 10

The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property
originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of

government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of
acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of
property immediately results. 'The Federalist' (1787) no. 10

This beast went to the well and drank, and the noise was in the beast's
belly like unto the questing of thirty couple hounds, but all the while
the beast drank there was no noise in the beast's belly.

'Le Morte D'Arthur' (1485) bk. 1, ch. 19 (questing yelping)

Me repenteth, said Merlin; because of the death of that lady thou shalt
strike a stroke most dolorous that ever man struck, except the stroke of
our Lord, for thou shalt hurt the truest knight and the man of most
worship that now liveth, and through that stroke three kingdoms shall be
in great poverty, misery and wretchedness twelve years, and the knight
shall not be whole of that wound for many years. 'Le Morte D'Arthur'
(1485) bk. 2, ch. 8

Ah, my little son, thou hast murdered thy mother! And therefore I
suppose thou that art a murderer so young, thou art full likely to be a
manly man in thine age...When he is christened let call him Tristram,
that is as much to say as a sorrowful birth. 'Le Morte D'Arthur' (1485)
bk. 8, ch. 1

Meanwhile came Sir Palomides, the good knight, following the questing
beast that had in shape like a serpent's head and a body like a leopard,
buttocked like a lion and footed like a hart. And in his body there was
such a noise as it had been twenty couple of hounds questing, and such
noise that beast made wheresomever he went. 'Le Morte D'Arthur' (1485)
bk. 9, ch. 12

God defend me, said Dinadan, for the joy of love is too short, and the

Now I thank God, said Sir Launcelot, for His great mercy of that I have
seen, for it sufficeth me. For, as I suppose, no man in this world hath
lived better than I have done, to achieve that I have done. 'Le Morte

The month of May was come, when every lusty heart beginneth to blossom,
and to bring forth fruit; for like as herbs and trees bring forth fruit
and flourish in May, in likewise every lusty heart that is in any manner
a lover, springeth and flourisheth in lusty deeds. 'Le Morte D'Arthur'
(1485) bk. 18, ch. 25

Therefore all ye that be lovers call unto your remembrance the month of
May, like as did Queen Guenevere, for whom I make here a little mention,
that while she lived she was a true lover, and therefore she had a good
end. 'Le Morte D'Arthur' (1485) bk. 18, ch. 25

Wherefore, madam, I pray you kiss me and never no more. Nay, said the

Said Sir Ector...Sir Launcelot...thou wert never matched of earthly
knight's hand; and thou wert the courteoust knight that ever bare
shield; and thou wert the truest friend to thy lover that ever bestrad
horse; and thou wert the truest lover of a sinful man that ever loved
woman; and thou wert the kindest man that ever struck with sword; and
thou wert the goodliest person that ever came among press of knights;
and thou wert the meekest man and the gentlest that ever ate in hall
among ladies; and thou wert the sternest knight to thy mortal foe that
ever put spear in the rest. 'Le Morte D'Arthur' (1485) bk. 21, ch. 13

Time has no divisions to mark its passage, there is never a thunderstorm

And waiting means hanging on ahead, it means regarding time and the
present moment not as a boon, but an obstruction; it means making their
actual content null and void, by mentally overleaping them. Waiting we
say is long. We might just as well---or more accurately---say it is
short, since it consumes whole spaces of time without our living them or
making any use of them as such. 'The Magic Mountain' (1924) ch. 5, sect.
5 (translation by H. T. Lowe-Porter)

We come out of the dark and go into the dark again, and in between lie
the experiences of our life. But the beginning and end, birth and death,
we do not experience; they have no subjective character, they fall
entirely in the category of objective events, and that's that. 'The
Magic Mountain' (1924) ch. 6, sect. (translation by H. T. Lowe-Porter)

Human reason needs only to will more strongly than fate, and she is

Magic Mountain' (1924) ch. 6, sect. 8, (translation by H. T.
Lowe-Porter)

For time is the medium of narration, as it is the medium of life. Both
are inextricably bound up with it, as are bodies in space. Similarly,
time is the medium of music; music divides, measures, articulates time,
and can shorten it, yet enhance its value, both at once. 'The Magic

soul again. Here will I dwell, for heaven be in these lips, And all is
dross that is not Helena. 'Doctor Faustus' (1604) act 5, sc. 1

Now hast thou but one bare hour to live, And then thou must be damned
perpetually. Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of heaven, That time
may cease, and midnight never come. Fair nature's eye, rise, rise again
and make Perpetual day; or let this hour be but A year, a month, a week,
a natural day, That Faustus may repent and save his soul. O lente lente
currite noctis equi. The stars move still, time runs, the clock will
strike, The devil will come, and Faustus must be damned.

O I'll leap up to my God: who pulls me down? See, see, where Christ's

You stars that reigned at my nativity, Whose influence hath allotted
death and hell, Now draw up Faustus like a foggy mist, Into the entrails

may issue from your smoky mouths, So that my soul may but ascend to
heaven. 'Doctor Faustus' (1604) act 5, sc. 2

Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight, And burnéd is
Apollo's laurel bough, That sometime grew within this learned man.

His body was as straight as Circe's wand etc. 'Hero and Leander'
(published 1598) First Sestiad, l. 61

It lies not in our power to love, or hate, For will in us is over-ruled
by fate. When two are stripped, long ere the course begin, We wish that
one should lose, the other win; And one especially do we affect Of two
gold ingots, like in each respect. The reason no man knows; let it
suffice, What we behold is censured by our eyes. Where both deliberate,
the love is slight; Who ever loved that loved not at first sight? 'Hero
and Leander' (published 1598) First Sestiad, l. 167.

I count religion but a childish toy, And hold there is no sin but
ignorance. 'The Jew of Malta' (written and performed c.1592) prologue

Thus methinks should men of judgement frame Their means of traffic from
the vulgar trade, And, as their wealth increaseth, so enclose Infinite
riches in a little room. 'The Jew of Malta' (c.1592) act 1, sc. 1

As for myself, I walk abroad o' nights And kill sick people groaning
under walls: Sometimes I go about and poison wells. 'The Jew of Malta'

Nature that framed us of four elements, Warring within our breasts for
regiment, Doth teach us all to have aspiring minds: Our souls, whose
faculties can comprehend The wondrous architecture of the world: And
measure every wand'ring planet's course, Still climbing after knowledge
infinite, And always moving as the restless spheres, Wills us to wear
ourselves and never rest, Until we reach the ripest fruit of all, That
perfect bliss and sole felicity, The sweet fruition of an earthly crown.

Ah fair Zenocrate, divine Zenocrate, Fair is too foul an epithet for
thee. 'Tamburlaine the Great' (1590) act 5, sc. 5

What is beauty saith my sufferings, then? If all the pens that ever
poets held Had fed the feeling of their masters' thoughts, And every
sweetness that inspired their hearts, Their minds, and muses on admired
themes: If all the heavenly quintessence they still From their immortal
flowers of Poesy, Wherein as in a mirror we perceive The highest reaches
of a human wit; If these had made one poem's period, And all combined in
beauty's worthiness, Yet should there hover in their restless heads One
thought, one grace, one wonder at the least, Which into words no virtue
can digest. 'Tamburlaine the Great' (1590) pt. 1, act 5, sc. 1

And every warrior that is rapt with love Of fame, of valour, and of
victory, Must needs have beauty beat on his conceits. 'Tamburlaine the

He hangs in shades the orange bright, Like golden lamps in a green
night. 'Bermudas' (written c.1653, published 1681)

And makes the hollow seas, that roar, Proclaim the ambergris on shore.
He cast (of which we rather boast) The gospel's pearl upon our coast.

Oh let our voice his praise exalt, Till it arrive at heaven's vault:
Which thence (perhaps) rebounding, may Echo beyond the Mexique Bay.
'Bermudas' (written c.1653, published 1681)

My love is of a birth as rare As 'tis for object strange and high: It
was begotten by Despair Upon Impossibility. Magnanimous Despair alone
Could show me so divine a thing, Where feeble Hope could ne'er have
flown But vainly flapped its tinsel wing. 'The Definition of Love'
(1681)

As lines (so loves) oblique may well Themselves in every angle greet:
But ours so truly parallel, Though infinite, can never meet. Therefore
the love which us doth bind, But Fate so enviously debars, Is the
conjunction of the mind, And opposition of the stars. 'The Definition of
Love' (1681)

Choosing each stone, and poising every weight, Trying the measures of
the breadth and height; Here pulling down, and there erecting new,

How vainly men themselves amaze To win the palm, the oak, or bays, And
their uncessant labours see

Crowned from some single herb or tree, Whose short and narrow vergéd
shade Does prudently their toils upbraid, While all flowers and all
trees do close To weave the garlands of repose. 'The Garden' (1681) st.

The gods, that mortal beauty chase, Still in a tree did end their race.
Apollo hunted Daphne so, Only that she might laurel grow. And Pan did

st. 4

What wondrous life is this I lead! Ripe apples drop about my head; The
luscious clusters of the vine Upon my mouth do crush their wine; The
nectarine, and curious peach, Into my hands themselves do reach;
Stumbling on melons, as I pass, Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass.

He nothing common did or mean Upon that memorable scene: But with his

To vindicate his helpless right, But bowed his comely head, Down as upon
a bed. 'An Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland' (written
1650, published 1681) l. 57 (on Charles I)

much one man can do, That does both act and know. 'An Horatian Ode upon

Ye living lamps, by whose dear light The nightingale does sit so late,
And studying all the summer night, Her matchless songs does meditate; Ye
country comets, that portend No war, nor prince's funeral, Shining unto
no higher end Then to presage the grass's fall. 'The Mower to the
Glow-worms' (1681)

It is a wondrous thing, how fleet 'Twas on those little silver feet.
With what a pretty skipping grace, It oft would challenge me the race:
And when 't had left me far away, 'Twould stay, and run again, and stay.
For it was nimbler much than hinds; And trod, as on the foùr winds. 'The

For though the whole world cannot show such another, Yet we'd better by

Charles II

Had we but world enough, and time, This coyness, lady, were no crime. We
would sit down, and think which way To walk, and pass our long love's
day. Thou by the Indian Ganges' side Shouldst rubies find: I by the tide
Of Humber would complain. I would Love you ten years before the flood:
And you should, if you please, refuse Till the conversion of the Jews.
My vegetable love should grow Vaster than empires, and more slow. 'To
His coy Mistress' (1681) l. 1

But at my back I always hear Time's wingéd chariot hurrying near: And
yonder all before us lie Deserts of vast eternity. Thy beauty shall no
more be found; Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound My echoing song:
then worms shall try That long preserved virginity: And your quaint
honour turn to dust; And into ashes all my lust. The grave's a fine and
private place, But none, I think, do there embrace. 'To His Coy
Mistress' (1681) l. 21

Let us roll all our strength, and all Our sweetness, up into one ball:
And tear our pleasures with rough strife, Thorough the iron gates of

Oh thou, that dear and happy isle The garden of the world ere while,
Thou paradise of four seas, Which heaven planted us to please, But, to

For he did, with his utmost skill, Ambition weed, but conscience till:
Conscience, that heaven-nurséd plant, Which most our earthy gardens
want. A prickling leaf it bears, and such As that which shrinks at every
touch; But flowers eternal, and divine, That in the crowns of saints do
shine. 'Upon Appleton House' (1681) st. 45

And now to the abyss I pass Of that unfathomable grass, Where men like
grasshoppers appear,

But grasshoppers are giants there: They, in their squeaking laugh,
contemn Us as we walk more low than them: And, from the precipices tall
Of the green spires, to us do call. 'Upon Appleton House' (1681) st. 47

Unhappy birds! what does it boot To build below the grass's root, When

Mankind always sets itself only such problems as it can solve; since,
looking at the matter more closely, it will always be found that the
task itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution
already exist or are at least in the process of formation. 'A
Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy' (1859) preface
(translation by D. McLellan)

It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but
their social existence that determines their consciousness. 'A
Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy' (1859) preface

And even when a society has got upon the right track for the discovery
of the natural laws of its movement---and it is the ultimate aim of this
work, to lay bare the economic law of motion of modern society---it can
neither clear by bold leaps, nor remove by legal enactments, the
obstacles offered by the successive phases of its normal development.
But it can shorten and lessen the birth-pangs. 'Das Kapital' (1st German
ed., 1867) preface (25 July 1865)

history reappear in one fashion or another. He forgot to add: the first

depressing subject matter...a soothing, calming influence on the mind,
rather like a good armchair which provides relaxation from physical

1.96 W. Somerset Maugham 1874-1965 Hypocrisy is the most difficult and

Il me souvient á ce sujet d'un souhait que faisait autrefois un homme,
qui n'avait ni science ni ètude...Il souhaitait, disait-il...que tous
les grands de la terre et que tous les nobles fussent pendus et
ètranglès avec les boyaux des prêtres. Pour ce qui est de moi...je
souhaitais d'avoir les bras et la force d'Hercule pour purger le monde
de tout vice et de toute iniquitè, et pour avoir le plaisir d'assommer
tous ces monstres d'erreurs et d'iniquitè qui font gèmir si
pitoyablement tous les peuples de la terre. I remember, on this matter,
the wish made once by an ignorant, uneducated man...He said he
wished...that all the great men in the world and all the nobility could
be hanged, and strangled in the guts of priests. For myself...I wish I
could have the strength of Hercules to purge the world of all vice and
sin, and the pleasure of destroying all those monsters of error and sin
\[priests\] who make all the peoples of the world groan so pitiably.
'Testament' (ed. R. Charles, 1864) vol. 1, ch. 2; often quoted as 'Je
voudrais...que le dernier des rois fût ètranglè avec les boyaux du
dernier prêtre \[I should like...the last of the kings to be strangled
with the guts of the last priest\]' or in Diderot's version: Et des
boyaux du dernier prêtre Serrons le cou du dernier roi. And \[with\] the

The word freedom has for me never had the character of a point of
departure but of a goal. The point of departure is order which alone can
produce freedom. Without order the appeal to freedom is no more than the
quest of some specific party for its special objectives and will in
practice always lead to tyranny. 'Aus Metternich's Nachgelassenen

Religion, morality, legislation, economics, politics, administration,

The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or

The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any

The principle which regulates the existing social relations between the
two sexes---the legal subordination of one sex to the other---is wrong
in itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement...it
ought to be replaced by a principle of perfect equality, admitting no
power or privilege on the one side, nor disability on the other. 'The
Subjection of Women' (1869) ch. 1

The moral regeneration of mankind will only really commence, when the

the rule of equal justice, and when human beings learn to cultivate
their strongest sympathy with an equal in rights and in cultivation.

He's not the finest character that ever lived. But he's a human being,
and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid.
'Death of a Salesman' (1949) act 1

For a salesman, there is no rock bottom to the life. He don't put a bolt
to a nut, he don't tell you the law or give you medicine. He's a man way
out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they
start not smiling back---that's an earthquake. And then you get yourself
a couple of spots on your hat, and you're finished. Nobody dast blame
this man. A salesman is got to dream, boy. It comes with the territory.

He respects Owl, because you can't help respecting anybody who can spell
TUESDAY, even if he doesn't spell it right; but spelling isn't
everything. There are days when spelling Tuesday simply doesn't count.
'The House at Pooh Corner' (1928) ch. 5

Pooh began to feel a little more comfortable, because when you are a
Bear of Very Little Brain, and you Think of Things, you sometimes find
that a Thing which seemed very Thingish inside you is quite different
when it gets out into the open and has other people looking at it. 'The
House at Pooh Corner' (1928) ch. 6

And some of the bigger bears try to pretend That they came round the
corner to look for a friend;

And they try to pretend that nobody cares Whether you walk on the lines

watch me walking in all the squares!' 'When We Were Very Young' (1924)

Above the smoke and stir of this dim spot, Which men call earth. 'Comus'

Yet some there be that by due steps aspire To lay their just hands on
that golden key That opes the palace of eternity. 'Comus' (1637) l. 12

Come, knit hands, and beat the ground, In a light fantastic round.
'Comus' (1637) l. 143

When the grey-hooded Even Like a sad votarist in palmer's weed Rose from
the hindmost wheels of Phoebus' wain. 'Comus' (1637) l. 188

O thievish Night Why shouldst thou, but for some felonious end, In thy
dark lantern thus close up the stars, That Nature hung in heaven, and
filled their lamps With everlasting oil, to give due light To the misled
and lonely traveller? 'Comus' (1637) l. 195

Was I deceived, or did a sable cloud Turn forth her silver lining on the
night? 'Comus' (1637) l. 221

Sweet Echo, sweetest nymph that liv'st unseen Within thy airy shell By
slow Meander's margent green, And in the violet-embroidered vale.
'Comus' (1637) l. 230

Can any mortal mixture of earth's mould Breathe such divine enchanting
ravishment? 'Comus' (1637) l. 244

Such sober certainty of waking bliss I never heard till now. 'Comus'

Shepherd, I take thy word, And trust thy honest-offered courtesy, Which
oft is sooner found in lowly sheds With smoky rafters, than in tap'stry
halls And courts of princes. 'Comus' (1637) l. 321

With thy long levelled rule of streaming light. 'Comus' (1637) l. 340

Virtue could see to do what Virtue would By her own radiant light,
though sun and moon Were in the flat sea sunk. And Wisdom's self Oft
seeks to sweet retired solitude, Where with her best nurse
Contemplation, She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings That in
the various bustle of resort

Were all to-ruffled, and sometimes impaired. He that has light within
his own clear breast May sit i' the centre, and enjoy bright day, But he
that hides a dark soul, and foul thoughts Benighted walks under the
midday sun; Himself is his own dungeon. 'Comus' (1637) l. 373

Yet where an equal poise of hope and fear Does arbitrate the event, my
nature is That I incline to hope, rather than fear, And gladly banish
squint suspicion. 'Comus' (1637) l. 410

'Tis chastity, my brother, chastity: She that has that, is clad in
complete steel. 'Comus' (1637) l. 420

How charming is divine philosophy! Not harsh and crabbéd, as dull fools
suppose, But musical as is Apollo's lute, And a perpetual feast of
nectared sweets, Where no crude surfeit reigns. 'Comus' (1637) l. 475

What the sage poets taught by th' heavenly Muse, Storied of old in high
immortal verse Of dire chimeras and enchanted isles, And rifted rocks
whose entrance leads to hell, For such there be, but unbelief is blind.
'Comus' (1637) l. 515

And filled the air with barbarous dissonance. 'Comus' (1637) l. 550

I was all ear, And took in strains that might create a soul Under the
ribs of death. 'Comus' (1637) l. 560

Against the threats Of malice or of sorcery, or that power Which erring
men call chance, this I hold firm, Virtue may be assailed, but never
hurt, Surprised by unjust force, but not enthralled. 'Comus' (1637) l.
586

O foolishness of men! that lend their ears

To those budge doctors of the Stoic fur, And fetch their precepts from
the Cynic tub, Praising the lean and sallow Abstinence. 'Comus' (1637)
l. 706

Beauty is Nature's coin, must not be hoarded, But must be current, and
the good thereof Consists in mutual and partaken bliss. 'Comus' (1637)
l. 739

Beauty is Nature's brag, and must be shown In courts, at feasts, and
high solemnities Where most may wonder at the workmanship; It is for
homely features to keep home, They had their name thence; coarse
complexions And cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply The sampler, and
to tease the housewife's wool. What need a vermeil-tinctured lip for
that, Love-darting eyes, or tresses like the morn? 'Comus' (1637) l. 745

Obtruding false rules pranked in reason's garb. 'Comus' (1637) l. 759

Sabrina fair, Listen where thou art sitting Under the glassy, cool,
translucent wave, In twisted braids of lilies knitting The loose train
of thy amber-dropping hair. 'Comus' (1637) l. 859

Thus I set my printless feet O'er the cowslip's velvet head, That bends
not as I tread. 'Comus' (1637) l. 897

Love Virtue, she alone is free, She can teach ye how to climb Higher
than the sphery chime; Or, if Virtue feeble were, Heaven itself would
stoop to her. 'Comus' (1637) l. 1019

Hence, vain deluding joys, The brood of folly without father bred. 'Il
Penseroso' (1645) l. 1

As thick and numberless

As the gay motes that people the sunbeams. 'Il Penseroso' (1645) l. 7

Hail, divinest Melancholy, Whose saintly visage is too bright To hit the
sense of human sight; And therefore to our weaker view, O'erlaid with
black staid wisdom's hue. 'Il Penseroso' (1645) l. 12

Come, pensive nun, devout and pure, Sober, steadfast, and demure. 'Il
Penseroso' (1645) l. 31

And join with thee calm Peace, and Quiet, Spare Fast, that oft with gods
doth diet. 'Il Penseroso' (1645) l. 45

And add to these retired Leisure, That in trim gardens takes his
pleasure. 'Il Penseroso' (1645) l. 49

Sweet bird that shunn'st the noise of folly, Most musical, most
melancholy! 'Il Penseroso' (1645) l. 61

And missing thee, I walk unseen On the dry smooth-shaven green, To
behold the wandering moon, Riding near her highest noon, Like one that
had been led astray Through the heaven's wide pathless way; And oft, as
if her head she bowed, Stooping through a fleecy cloud. 'Il Penseroso'
(1645) l. 65

Oft on a plat of rising ground, I hear the far-off curfew sound Over
some wide-watered shore, Swinging slow with sullen roar. 'Il Penseroso'
(1645) l. 73

Where glowing embers through the room Teach light to counterfeit a
gloom, Far from all resort of mirth, Save the cricket on the hearth. 'Il
Penseroso' (1645) l. 79

Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing

Such notes as warbled to the string, Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek.
'Il Penseroso' (1645) l. 105

Where more is meant than meets the ear. 'Il Penseroso' (1645) l. 120

Hide me from day's garish eye, While the bee with honied thigh, That at
her flowery work doth sing, And the waters murmuring And such consort as
they keep, Entice the dewy-feathered Sleep. 'Il Penseroso' (1645) l. 141

But let my due feet never fail To walk the studious cloister's pale. 'Il
Penseroso' (1645) l. 155

And love the high embowéd roof, With antique pillars' massy proof, And
storied windows richly dight, Casting a dim religious light. There let
the pealing organ blow To the full-voiced quire below, In service high,
and anthems clear, As may with sweetness, through mine ear, Dissolve me
into ecstasies, And bring all heaven before mine eyes. 'Il Penseroso'
(1645) l. 157

Till old experience do attain To something like prophetic strain. 'Il
Penseroso' (1645) l. 173

Hence, loathéd Melancholy, Of Cerberus, and blackest Midnight born, In
Stygian cave forlorn 'Mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights

So buxom, blithe, and debonair. 'L'Allegro' (1645) l. 24 (on Euphrosyne
(Mirth), one of the three graces)

Haste thee nymph, and bring with thee Jest and youthful jollity, Quips
and cranks, and wanton wiles, Nods, and becks, and wreathéd smiles.

'L'Allegro' (1645) l. 25

Sport that wrinkled Care derides, And Laughter holding both his sides.
Come, and trip it as ye go On the light fantastic toe, And in thy right
hand lead with thee, The mountain nymph, sweet Liberty. 'L'Allegro'
(1645) l. 31

Mirth, admit me of thy crew To live with her, and live with thee, In
unreprovéd pleasures free. 'L'Allegro' (1645) l. 38

While the cock with lively din Scatters the rear of darkness thin, And
to the stack, or the barn door, Stoutly struts his dames before.
'L'Allegro' (1645) l. 49

Right against the eastern gate, Where the great sun begins his state.
'L'Allegro' (1645) l. 59

While the ploughman near at hand, Whistles o'er the furrowed land, And
the milkmaid singeth blithe, And the mower whets his scythe, And every
shepherd tells his tale Under the hawthorn in the dale. 'L'Allegro'
(1645) l. 63

Meadows trim with daisies pied, Shallow brooks, and rivers wide, Towers,
and battlements it sees Bosomed high in tufted trees, Where perhaps some
beauty lies, The cynosure of neighbouring eyes. 'L'Allegro' (1645) l. 75

Of herbs, and other country messes, Which the neat-handed Phyllis
dresses. 'L'Allegro' (1645) l. 85

And the jocund rebecks sound To many a youth, and many a maid, Dancing
in the chequered shade;

And young and old come forth to play On a sunshine holiday. 'L'Allegro'

Then to the spicy nut-brown ale. 'L'Allegro' (1645) l. 100

Towered cities please us then, And the busy hum of men. 'L'Allegro'
(1645) l. 117

With store of ladies, whose bright eyes Rain influence, and judge the
prize Of wit or arms. 'L'Allegro' (1645) l. 121

There let Hymen oft appear In saffron robe, with taper clear, And pomp,
and feast, and revelry, With masque, and antique pageantry: Such sights
as youthful poets dream On summer eves by haunted stream. Then to the
well-trod stage anon, If Jonson's learnéd sock be on, Or sweetest
Shakespeare fancy's child, Warble his native wood-notes wild, And ever
against eating cares, Lap me in soft Lydian airs, Married to immortal
verse Such as the meeting soul may pierce In notes, with many a winding
bout Of linkéd sweetness long drawn out. 'L'Allegro' (1645) l. 125

Such strains as would have won the ear Of Pluto, to have quite set free
His half-regained Eurydice. 'L'Allegro' (1645) l. 148

Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more Ye myrtles brown, with ivy
never sere, I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude, And with
forced fingers rude Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.
Bitter constraint, and sad occasion dear, Compels me to disturb your
season due;

For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime, Young Lycidas, and hath not
left his peer: Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew Himself to sing,
and build the lofty rhyme. He must not float upon his watery bier
Unwept, and welter to the parching wind, Without the meed of some
melodious tear. 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 1

Hence with denial vain, and coy excuse. 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 18

For we were nursed upon the self-same hill. 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 23

But O the heavy change, now thou art gone, Now thou art gone, and never
must return! 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 37

The woods, and desert caves, With wild thyme and the gadding vine
o'ergrown. 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 39

Where were ye nymphs, when the remorseless deep Closed o'er the head of
your loved Lycidas? 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 50

Alas! What boots it with uncessant care To tend the homely slighted
shepherd's trade, And strictly meditate the thankless muse; Were it not
better done as others use, To sport with Amaryllis in the shade, Or with
the tangles of Neaera's hair? Fame is the spur that the clear spirit
doth raise (That last infirmity of noble mind) To scorn delights, and
live laborious days; But the fair guerdon when we hope to find, And
think to burst out into sudden blaze, Comes the blind Fury with th'
abhorréd shears, And slits the thin-spun life. 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 64

Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil. 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 78

It was that fatal and perfidious bark Built in th' eclipse, and rigged
with curses dark, That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.

'Lycidas' (1638) l. 100

Last came, and last did go, The pilot of the Galilean lake, Two massy
keys he bore of metals twain (The golden opes, the iron shuts amain).
'Lycidas' (1638) l. 108

Enow of such as for their bellies' sake, Creep and intrude, and climb
into the fold! Of other care they little reck'ning make, Than how to
scramble at the shearers' feast, And shove away the worthy bidden guest.
Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold A sheep-hook, or
have learned aught else the least That to the faithful herdman's art
belongs! 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 114

And when they list, their lean and flashy songs Grate on their scrannel
pipes of wretched straw, The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed, But
swoll'n with wind, and the rank mist they draw, Rot inwardly, and foul
contagion spread; Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw Daily
devours apace, and nothing said; But that two-handed engine at the door
Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more. 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 123

Return, Alpheus, the dread voice is past That shrunk thy streams; return
Sicilian muse. 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 132

Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies, The tufted crow-toe, and
pale jessamine, The white pink, and the pansy freaked with jet, The
glowing violet, The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine, With
cowslips wan that hang the pensive head, And every flower that sad
embroidery wears: Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed, And daffodillies
fill their cups with tears, To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid
lies. 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 142

Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,

Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide Visit'st the bottom of the
monstrous world; Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied, Sleep'st by
the fable of Bellerus old, Where the great vision of the guarded mount
Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold; Look homeward angel now, and
melt with ruth. 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 156

For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the
watery floor, So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed, And yet anon
repairs his drooping head, And tricks his beams, and with new spangled
ore, Flames in the forehead of the morning sky: So Lycidas sunk low, but
mounted high, Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves.
'Lycidas' (1638) l. 166

There entertain him all the saints above, In solemn troops, and sweet
societies That sing, and singing in their glory move, And wipe the tears
for ever from his eyes. 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 178

Thus sang the uncouth swain to th' oaks and rills, While the still morn
went out with sandals grey, He touched the tender stops of various
quills, With eager thought warbling his Doric lay. 'Lycidas' (1638) l.
186

At last he rose, and twitched his mantle blue: Tomorrow to fresh woods,
and pastures new. 'Lycidas' (1638) l. 192

What needs my Shakespeare for his honoured bones, The labour of an age
in piléd stones, Or that his hallowed relics should be hid Under a
star-ypointing pyramid? 'On Shakespeare' (1632)

This is the month, and this the happy morn Wherein the son of heaven's
eternal king,

Of wedded maid, and virgin mother born, Our great redemption from above
did bring; For so the holy sages once did sing, That he our deadly
forfeit should release, And with his father work us a perpetual peace.

The star-led wizards haste with odours sweet. 'On the Morning of

in the rude manger lies; Nature in awe to him Had doffed her gaudy trim,
With her great master so to sympathize. 'On the Morning of Christ's
Nativity: The Hymn' (1645) st. 1

No war, or battle's sound Was heard the world around, The idle spear and

The stars with deep amaze Stand fixed in steadfast gaze, Bending one way
their precious influence, And will not take their flight For all the
morning light, Or Lucifer that often warned them thence; But in their
glimmering orbs did glow, Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them
go. 'On the Morning of Christ's Nativity: The Hymn' (1645) st. 6

Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep, Was all that did their silly

Ring out, ye crystal spheres, Once bless our human ears (If ye have
power to touch our senses so), And let your silver chime Move in
melodious time;

And let the base of heaven's deep organ blow, And with your ninefold
harmony Make up full consort to the angelic symphony. 'On the Morning of
Christ's Nativity: The Hymn' (1645) st. 13

For if such holy song Enwrap our fancy long, Time will run back, and

Henceforth I fly not death, nor would prolong Life much, bent rather how
I may quit Fairest and easiest of this cumbrous charge, Which I must
keep till my appointed day Of rendering up, and patiently attend My
dissolution. 'Paradise Lost' (1667) bk. 11, l. 547

Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou liv'st Live well, how long or
short permit to heaven. 'Paradise Lost' (1667) bk. 11, l. 553

For now I see Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste. 'Paradise
Lost' (1667) bk. 11, l. 783

O goodness infinite, goodness immense! That all this good of evil shall
produce, And evil turn to good; more wonderful Than that which by
creation first brought forth Light out of darkness! full of doubt I
stand, Whether I should repent me now of sin By me done and occasioned,
or rejoice Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring.
'Paradise Lost' (1667) bk. 12, l. 469

Only add Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add faith, Add virtue,
patience, temperance, add love, By name to come called Charity, the soul
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath To leave this Paradise, but
shalt possess A paradise within thee, happier far.

'Paradise Lost' (1667) bk. 12, l. 581

In me is no delay; with thee to go, Is to stay here; without thee here
to stay, Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me Art all things under
heaven, all places thou, Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.
'Paradise Lost' (1667) bk. 12, l. 615

They looking back, all the eastern side beheld Of Paradise, so late
their happy seat, Waved over by that flaming brand, the gate With
dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms: Some natural tears they dropped,
but wiped them soon; The world was all before them, where to choose
Their place of rest, and Providence their guide: They hand in hand, with
wandering steps and slow, Through Eden took their solitary way.

Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts And eloquence, native to
famous wits Or hospitable, in her sweet recess, City or suburban,

Doth God exact day-labour, light denied, I fondly ask; but patience to
prevent That murmur, soon replies, God doth not need Either man's work

For this is not the liberty which we can hope, that no grievance ever
should arise in the Commonwealth, that let no man in this world expect;
but when complaints are freely heard, deeply considered, and speedily
reformed, then is the utmost bound of civil liberty attained that wise
men look for. 'Areopagitica' (1644) p. 1

Books are not absolutely dead things, but do contain a potency of life
in them to be as active as that soul was whose progeny they are; nay
they do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy and extraction of that
living intellect that bred them. 'Areopagitica' (1644) p. 4

As good almost kill a man as kill a good book: who kills a man kills a
reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a good book, kills
reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were in the eye.
'Areopagitica' (1644) p. 4

A good book is the precious life-blood of a master spirit, embalmed and
treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life. 'Areopagitica' (1644)
p. 4

It was from out the rind of one apple tasted that the knowledge of good
and evil as two twins cleaving together leaped forth into the world. And
perhaps this is that doom that Adam fell into of knowing good and evil,
that is to say, of knowing good by evil. 'Areopagitica' (1644) p. 12

He that can apprehend and consider vice with all her baits and seeming
pleasures, and yet

abstain, and yet distinguish, and yet prefer that which is truly better,
he is the true warfaring Christian. I cannot praise a fugitive and
cloistered virtue, unexercised and unbreathed, that never sallies out
and sees her adversary, but slinks out of the race, where that immortal
garland is to be run for, not without dust and heat. Assuredly we bring
not innocence into the world, we bring impurity much rather: that which
purifies us is trial, and trial is by what is contrary. 'Areopagitica'
(1644) p. 12

If we think to regulate printing, thereby to rectify manners, we must
regulate all recreations and pastimes, all that is delightful to
man...It will ask more than the work of twenty licensers to examine all
the lutes, the violins, and the guitars in every house; they must not be
suffered to pratle as they do, but must be licenced what they may say.
And who shall silence all the airs and madrigals, that whisper softness
in chambers? 'Areopagitica' (1644) p. 16

From that time ever since, the sad friends of Truth, such as durst
appear, imitating the careful search that Isis made for the mangled body
of Osiris, went up and down gathering up limb by limb still as they
could find them. We have not yet found them all, Lords and Commons, nor
ever shall do, till her Master's second coming; He shall bring together
every joint and member, and shall mould them into an immortal feature of
loveliness and perfection. 'Areopagitica' (1644) p. 29

To be still searching what we know not, by what we know, still closing
up truth to truth as we find it (for all her body is homogeneal and
proportional), this is the golden rule in theology as well as in
arithmetic, and makes up the best harmony in a church. 'Areopagitica'
(1644) p. 30

God is decreeing to begin some new and great period in his Church, even
to the reforming of Reformation itself. What does he then but reveal
Himself to his servants, and as his manner is, first to his Englishmen?
'Areopagitica' (1644) p. 31

Behold now this vast city \[London\]; a city of refuge, the
mansion-house of liberty, encompassed and surrounded with his
protection. 'Areopagitica' (1644) p. 31

Where there is much desire to learn, there of necessity will be much
arguing, much writing, many opinions; for opinion in good men is but
knowledge in the making. 'Areopagitica' (1644) p. 31

Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousing herself
like a strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible locks.
Methinks I see her as an eagle mewing her mighty youth, and kindling her
undazzled eyes at the full midday beam. 'Areopagitica' (1644) p. 34

Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to
conscience, above all liberties. 'Areopagitica' (1644) p. 34

Though all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play upon the earth,
so Truth be in the field,

we do injuriously by licensing and prohibiting to misdoubt her strength.
Let her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse, in
a free and open encounter? 'Areopagitica' (1644) p. 35

Let not England forget her precedence of teaching nations how to live.

I call therefore a complete and generous education that which fits a man
to perform justly, skilfully and magnanimously all the offices both
private and public of peace and war. 'Of Education' (1644)

Ornate rhetoric taught out of the rule of Plato...To which poetry would
be made subsequent, or indeed rather precedent, as being less subtle and
fine, but more simple, sensuous and passionate. 'Of Education' (1644)

In those vernal seasons of the year, when the air is calm and pleasant,
it were an injury and sullenness against nature not to go out, and see
her riches, and partake in her rejoicing with heaven and earth. 'Of

But because about the manner and order of this government, whether it
ought to be Presbyterial, or Prelatical, such endless question, or
rather uproar is arisen in this land, as may be justly termed, what the
fever is to the physicians, the eternal reproach of our divines. 'The

This manner of writing \[prose\] wherein knowing myself inferior to

By labour and intent study (which I take to be my portion in this life)
joined with the strong propensity of nature, I might perhaps leave
something so written to aftertimes, as they should not willingly let it

Credo in unum Deum, Patrem omnipotentem, factorem coeli et terrae,
visibilium omnium et invisibilium. Et in unum Dominum Jesum Christum
Filium Dei unigenitum, et ex Patre natum ante omnia saecula: Deum de
Deo, lumen de lumine, Deum verum de Deo vero; genitum non factum,
consubstantialem Patri, per quem omnia facta sunt. Qui propter nos
homines, et propter nostram salutem, descendit de coelis; et incarnatus
est de Spiritu Sancto, ex Maria Virgine; ET HOMO FACTUS EST. Crucifixus
etiam pro nobis, sub Pontio Pilato passus, et sepultus est. Et
resurrexit tertia die, secundum Scripturas; et ascendit in coelum; sedet
ad dexteram Patris; et iterum venturus est cum gloria, judicare vivos et
mortuos; cuius regni non erit finis. Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum
vivificantem, qui ex Patre Filioque procedit; qui cum Patre et Filio
simul adoratur, et conglorificatur; qui locutus est per Prophetas. Et
unam sanctam Catholicam et Apostolicam Ecclesiam. Confiteor unum
Baptisma in remissionem peccatorum. Et expecto resurrectionem mortuorum,
et vitam venturi saeculi. I believe in one God, the Father almighty,
maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And
in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, and born of the
Father before all ages; God of God, light of light; true God of true
God; begotten, not made; consubstantial with the Father, by whom all
things were made. Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from
heaven; and became incarnate by the Holy Ghost, of the Virgin Mary; AND
WAS MADE MAN. He was crucified also for us, suffered under Pontius
Pilate, and was buried. And the third day he rose again according to the
Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of the
Father; and he is to come again with glory, to judge both the living and
the dead; of whose kingdom there shall be no end. And in the Holy Ghost,
the Lord and giver of life, who proceedeth from the Father and the Son;
who together with the Father and the Son, is adored and glorified; who
spoke by the Prophets. And one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. I
confess one Baptism for the remission of sins. And I expect the
resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. 'The

How much it is to be regretted, that the British ladies should ever sit

imagination...The new system of weights and measures will be a stumbling

Goethe, lequel pourtant n'ètait pas fou. Why should a lobster be any
more ridiculous than a dog...or any other animal that one chooses to
take for a walk? I have a liking for lobsters. They are peaceful,
serious creatures. They know the secrets of the sea, they don't bark,
and they don't gnaw upon one's monadic privacy like dogs do. And Goethe
had an aversion to dogs, and he wasn't mad. In justification of his

Drake he's in his hammock till the great Armadas come. (Capten, art tha

Now the sunset breezes shiver, And she's fading down the river, But in
England's song for ever She's the Fighting Tèmèraire. 'The Fighting
Tèmèraire'

There's a breathless hush in the Close to-night--- Ten to make and the
match to win--- A bumping pitch and a blinding light, An hour to play
and the last man in. And it's not for the sake of a ribboned coat, Or
the selfish hope of a season's fame, But his Captain's hand on his
shoulder smote--- 'Play up! play up! and play the game!' 'Vitaï Lampada'

more bigoted, more gloomy, more fierce in its religion than at present
it shows itself to be. 'Apologia pro Vita Sua' (1864) 'History of My
Religious Opinions from 1833 to 1839'

From the age of fifteen, dogma has been the fundamental principle of my
religion: I know no other religion; I cannot enter into the idea of any
other sort of religion; religion, as a mere sentiment, is to me a dream
and a mockery. 'Apologia pro Vita Sua' (1864) 'History of My Religious
Opinions from 1833 to 1839'

This is what the Church is said to want, not party men, but sensible,
temperate, sober, welljudging persons, to guide it through the channel

She \[the Catholic Church\] holds that it were better for sun and moon
to drop from heaven, for the earth to fail, and for all the many
millions who are upon it to die of starvation in extremest agony, as far
as temporal affliction goes, than that one soul, I will not say, should
be lost, but should commit one single venial sin, should tell one wilful
untruth...or steal one poor farthing without excuse. 'Lectures on
Anglican Difficulties' (1852) Lecture 8

And this is all that is known, and more than all---yet nothing to what
the angels know---of the life of a servant of God, who sinned and
repented, and did penance and washed out his sins, and became a Saint,
and reigns with Christ in heaven. 'Lives of the English Saints' (1844-5)

Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom, Lead thou me on; The
night is dark, and I am far from home, Lead thou me on. Keep Thou my
feet; I do not ask to see The distant scene; one step enough for me.
'Lead, kindly Light' (1834)

I loved the garish day, and spite of fears, Pride ruled my will:

Whence is it that Nature does nothing in vain: and whence arises all
that order and beauty which we see in the world?...does it not appear
from phenomena that there is a Being incorporeal, living, intelligent,
omnipresent, who in infinite space, as it were in his Sensory, sees the
things themselves intimately, and thoroughly perceives them, and
comprehends them wholly. 'Opticks' (1730 ed.) bk. 3, pt. 1, qu. 28

The changing of bodies into light, and light into bodies, is very
conformable to the course of Nature, which seems delighted with

2.39 Alfred Noyes 1880-1958 The wind was a torrent of darkness among the
gusty trees, The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, The
road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, And the highwayman
came riding--- Riding---riding--- The highwayman came riding, up to the
old inn-door. 'The Highwayman' (1907)

England...resembles a family, a rather stuffy Victorian family, with not
many black sheep in it but with all its cupboards bursting with
skeletons. It has rich relations who have to be kowtowed to and poor
relations who are horribly sat upon, and there is a deep conspiracy of
silence about the source of the family income (ie the Empire). It is a
family in which the young are generally thwarted and most of the power
is in the hands of irresponisble uncles and bed-ridden aunts. Still, it
is a family. It has its private language and its common memories, and at
the approach of an enemy it closes its ranks. A family with the wrong
members in control. 'The Lion and the Unicorn' (1941) pt. 1 'England

'Shooting an Elephant' (1950) 'Politics and the English Language'

The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap
between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were
instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish
squirting out ink. 'Shooting an Elephant' (1950) 'Politics and the
English Language'

Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with
hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, and disregard of all the rules.
'Shooting an Elephant' (1950)

Political language---and with variations this is true of all political
parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists---is designed to make lies
sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of
solidity to pure wind. 'Shooting an Elephant' (1950) 'Politics and the
English Language'

Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent.

3.29 Dorothy Osborne 1627-95 The heat of the day is spent in reading or
working, and about six or seven o'clock, I walk out into a common that
lies hard by the house, where a great many young wenches keep sheep and
cows and sit in the shade singing of ballads...I talk to them, and find
they want nothing to make them the happiest people in the world, but the
knowledge that they are so. 'The Letters of Dorothy Osborne to William
Temple' (ed. G. C. Moore Smith, 1928) June 1653

All letters, methinks, should be as free and easy as one's discourse,
not studied as an oration, nor made up of hard words like a charm.
Letter to Sir William Temple, October 1653

I had rather agree to what you say than tell you that Dr Taylor (whose
devote you must know I am) says there is a great advantage to be gained
in resigning up one's will to the command of another, because the same
action which in itself is wholly indifferent if done upon our own
choice, becomes an act of duty and religion if done in obedience to the
command of any person whom nature, the laws, or our selves have given a
power over us. 'The Letters of Dorothy Osborne to William Temple'

3.41 Wilfred Owen 1893-1918 My subject is War, and the pity of War. The
Poetry is in the pity. Preface (written 1918)

All a poet can do today is warn. Preface (written 1918)

What passing-bells for these who die as cattle? ---Only the monstrous
anger of the guns. Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle Can patter
out their hasty orisons. No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor
bells, Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,--- The shrill,
demented choirs of wailing shells;

And bugles calling for them from sad shires. 'Anthem for Doomed Youth'
(written 1917)

The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall; Their flowers the
tenderness of patient minds, And each slow dusk a drawing-down of
blinds. 'Anthem for Doomed Youth' (written 1917)

Move him into the sun--- Gently its touch awoke him once, At home,
whispering of fields half-sown... If anything might rouse him now The
kind old sun will know. 'Futility' (written 1918)

Was it for this the clay grew tall? ---O what made fatuous sunbeams toil
To break earth's sleep at all? 'Futility' (written 1918)

Red lips are not so red As the stained stones kissed by the English
dead. 'Greater Love' (written 1917)

So secretly, like wrongs hushed-up, they went. They were not ours: We
never heard to which front these were sent. Nor there if they yet mock
what women meant Who gave them flowers. 'The Send-Off' (written 1918)

It seemed that out of battle I escaped Down some profound dull tunnel,
long since scooped Through granites which titanic wars had groined.
'Strange Meeting' (written 1918)

'Strange friend,' I said, 'here is no cause to mourn.' 'None,' said that
other, 'save the undone years, The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours,
Was my life also; I went hunting wild After the wildest beauty in the
world. 'Strange Meeting' (written 1918)

Courage was mine, and I had mystery, Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery:
To miss the march of this retreating world Into vain citadels that are
not walled. 'Strange Meeting' (written 1918)

I am the enemy you killed, my friend. I knew you in this dark: for you
so frowned Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed. I parried; but
my hands were loath and cold. Let us sleep now... 'Strange Meeting'

4.2 William Tyler Page 1868-1942 I believe in the United States of
America as a government of the people, by the people, for the people,
whose just powers are derived from the consent of the governed; a
democracy in a republic; a sovereign Nation of many sovereign States; a
perfect Union, one and inseparable, established upon those principles of
freedom, equality, justice, and humanity for which American patriots
sacrificed their lives and fortunes. I therefore believe it is my duty
to my country to love it, to support its Constitution, to obey its laws,
to respect its flag, and to defend it against all enemies. 'American's
Creed' (prize-winning competition entry, 3 April 1918) in 'Congressional
Record' vol. 56, pt. 12 (appendix), p. 286.

4.3 Thomas Paine 1737-1809 It is necessary to the happiness of man that
he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in
believing, or in disbelieving, it consists in professing to believe what
one does not believe. 'The Age of Reason' pt. 1 (1794) ch. 1

Any system of religion that has any thing in it that shocks the mind of
a child cannot be a true

system. 'The Age of Reason' pt. 1 (1794)

The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related, that it is
difficult to class them separately. One step above the sublime, makes
the ridiculous; and one step above the ridiculous, makes the sublime
again. 'The Age of Reason' pt. 2 (1795) p. 20

Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its
worst state, an intolerable one. Government, like dress, is the badge of
lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built upon the ruins of the
bowers of paradise. 'Common Sense' (1776) ch. 1

As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of government to
protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I know of no other
business which government hath to do therewith. 'Common Sense' (1776)
ch. 4

These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the
sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their
country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of men

\[In France\] All that class of equivocal generation, which in some
countries is called aristocracy, and in others nobility, is done away,

Persecution is not an original feature of any religion; but it is always
the strongly marked feature of all law-religions, or religions

All hereditary government is in its nature tyranny...To inherit a
government, is to inherit the people, as if they were flocks and herds.

perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and perpetual and these
interests it is our duty to follow. Speech on the Polish Question in the
House of Commons, 1848

I therefore fearlessly challenge the verdict which this House...is to
give...whether, as the Roman, in days of old, held himself free from
indignity, when he could say Civis Romanus sum; so also a British
subject, in whatever land he may be, shall feel confident that the
watchful eye and the strong arm of England will protect him against
injustice and wrong. House of Commons, 25 June 1850, in the Don Pacifico
debate.

You may call it coalition, you may call it the accidental and fortuitous
concurrence of atoms. On a projected Palmerston-Disraeli coalition.
House of Commons, 5 March 1857

We do not want Egypt any more than any rational man with an estate in
the north of England and a residence in the south, would have wished to
possess the inns on the north road. All he could want would have been
that the inns should be well kept, always accessible, and furnishing
him, when he came, with mutton chops and post horses. Letter to Earl
Cowley, 25 November 1859, in Hon. Evelyn Ashley 'Life of Henry John
Temple, Viscount Palmerston 1846-65' (1876) vol. 2, p. 1245

Woman wants monogamy; Man delights in novelty. Love is woman's moon and

She \[the Mona Lisa\] is older than the rocks among which she sits; like
the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of
the grave; and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day
about her; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants: and,
as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and as Saint Anne, the mother
of Mary; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and
flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the
changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands. 'Studies in

Her ball-dress seemed a breathing mist, From the fair form exhaled and
shed, Raised in the dance with arm and wrist All warmth and light

Ah, none but I discerned her looks, When in the throng she passed me by,
For love is like a ghost, and brooks Only the chosen seer's eye. 'The
County Ball'

Hope's self, when we were far apart, With lonely feeling, like the smell
Of heath on mountains, filled my heart. To see her seemed delight's full
scope, And her kind smile, so clear of care, Even then, though darkening
all my hope, Gilded the cloud of my despair. 'Sahara'

Kind souls, you wonder why, love you, When you, you wonder why, love

A book that furnishes no quotations is, me judice, no book---it is a
plaything. 'Crotchet Castle' (1831) ch. 9

The march of mind has marched in through my back parlour shutters, and
out again with my silver spoons, in the dead of night. The policeman,
who was sent down to examine, says my house has been broken open on the
most scientific principles. 'Crotchet Castle' (1831) ch. 17

A Sympathizer would seem to imply a certain degree of benevolent
feeling. Nothing of the kind. It signifies a ready-made accomplice in

Marriage may often be a stormy lake, but celibacy is almost always a
muddy horsepond. 'Melincourt' (1817)

But though first love's impassioned blindness Has passed away in colder
light, I still have thought of you with kindness, And shall do, till our
last good-night. The ever-rolling silent hours

4.32 Sir Robert Peel 1788-1850 I may be a Tory. I may be an
illiberal---but...Tory as I am, I have the further satisfaction of
knowing that there is not a single law connected with my name which has
not had as its object some mitigation of the criminal law; some
prevention of abuse in the exercise of it; or some security for its
impartial administration. House of Commons, 1 May 1827

What thing is love for (well I wot) love is a thing. It is a prick, it
is a sting, It is a pretty, pretty thing; It is a fire, it is a coal

Whose flame creeps in at every hole. 'The Hunting of Cupid' (c.1591)

When as the rye reach to the chin, And chopcherry, chopcherry ripe
within, Strawberries swimming in the cream, And schoolboys playing in
the stream, Then O, then O, then O, my true love said, Till that time
come again, She could not live a maid. 'The Old Wive's Tale' (1595) l.
75 'Song'

His golden locks time hath to silver turned; O time too swift, O
swiftness never ceasing! His youth 'gainst time and age hath ever
spurned But spurned in vain; youth waneth by increasing: Beauty,
strength, youth, are flowers but fading seen; Duty, faith, love, are
roots, and ever green. His helmet now shall make a hive for bees, And,
lovers' sonnets turned to holy psalms, A man-at-arms must now serve on
his knees, And feed on prayers, which are age his alms: But though from
court to cottage he depart, His saint is sure of his unspotted heart...
Goddess, allow this aged man his right, To be your beadsman now that was
your knight. 'Polyhymnia' (1590) ad fin. 'Sonnet'

Music and women I cannot but give way to, whatever my business is.
'Diary' 9 March 1666

But it is pretty to see what money will do. 'Diary' 21 March 1667

This day my wife made it appear to me that my late entertainment this
week cost me above £12, an expense which I am almost ashamed of, though
it is but once in a great while, and is the end for which, in the most
part, we live, to have such a merry day once or twice in a man's life.
'Diary' 6 March 1669

And so I betake myself to that course, which is almost as much as to see
myself go into my grave---for which, and all the discomforts that will

With first-rate sherry flowing into second-rate whores, And third-rate
conversation without one single pause: Just like a young couple Between
the wars. 'Father and Son: 1939' (1945)

evermore. 'The Raven' (1845) st. 2

Helen, thy beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks of yore, That gently,
o'er a perfumed sea, The weary, wayworn wanderer bore

To his own native shore. On desperate seas long wont to roam, Thy
hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home, To
the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome. 'To Helen'

Mortimer' (1721) l. 1

She went, to plain-work, and to purling brooks, Old-fashioned halls,
dull aunts, and croaking rooks: She went from op'ra, park, assembly,
play, To morning-walks, and prayers three hours a day; To pass her time
'twixt reading and Bohea, To muse, and spill her solitary tea, Or o'er
cold coffee trifle with the spoon, Court the slow clock, and dine exact
at noon. 'Epistle to Miss Blount, on her leaving the Town, after the
Coronation' (of King George I, 1715) (1717)

Criticism' (1711) l. 293

move slow. 'An Essay on Criticism' (1711) l. 368

Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move, For fools admire, but men of
sense approve. 'An Essay on Criticism' (1711) l. 390

Awake, my St John! leave all meaner things To low ambition, and the

Hope springs eternal in the human breast: Man never Is, but always To be
blest. 'An Essay on Man' Epistle 1 (1733) l. 95

Lo! the poor Indian, whose untutored mind Sees God in clouds, or hears
him in the wind; His soul proud Science never taught to stray Far as the

Behind the cloud-topped hill, an humbler heav'n. 'An Essay on Man'
Epistle 1 (1733) l. 99

God the soul. 'An Essay on Man' Epistle 1 (1733) l. 267

All nature is but art, unknown to thee; All chance, direction, which
thou canst not see; All discord, harmony, not understood; All partial
evil, universal good: And, spite of Pride, in erring Reason's spite, One
truth is clear, 'Whatever is, is right.' 'An Essay on Man' Epistle 1
(1733) l. 289

Know then thyself, presume not God to scan; The proper study of mankind
is man. Placed on this isthmus of a middle state, A being darkly wise,
and rudely great: With too much knowledge for the sceptic side, With too
much weakness for the stoic's pride, He hangs between; in doubt to act
or rest, In doubt to deem himself a gd, or beast; In doubt his mind or
body to prefer, Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err; Alike in
ignorance, his reason such, Whether he thinks too little, or too much.

Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule--- Then drop into thyself, and be a
fool! 'An Essay on Man' Epistle 2 (1733) l. 29

established, which in continuance of time hath not been corrupted. 'The
Preface' Concerning the Service of the Church

heavenly Father; but confess them with an humble, lowly, penitent, and
obedient heart. 'Morning Prayer', after the beginning Sentences

health in us. 'Morning Prayer', General Confession

unto mankind in Christ Jesu our Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father,
for his sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober
life. 'Morning Prayer', General Confession

I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth: And in

Born of the Virgin Mary, Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified,

from the dead, He ascended into heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of

Table, until he have openly declared himself to have truly repented and
amended his

for the sins of the whole world. 'Holy Communion' 'Prayer of

Who, in the same night that he was betrayed, took Bread; and, when he
had given thanks, he brake it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,

had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of this; for
this is my Blood of the New Testament, which is shed for you and for
many for the remission of sins: Do this, as oft as ye shall drink it, in
remembrance of me. 'Holy Communion' 'Prayer of Consecration'

strength, because of thine enemies: that thou mightest still the enemy,
and the avenger. For I will consider thy heavens, even the works of thy
fingers: the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained. What is man,
that thou art mindful of him: and the son of man, that thou visitest
him?

worship. Psalm 8, v. 2

with his neighbour: they do but flatter with their lips, and dissemble
in their double heart. Psalm 12, v. 1

Psalm 14, v. 4

Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle: or who shall rest upon thy holy
hill? Even he, that leadeth an uncorrupt life: and doeth the thing which
is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart. He that hath used no
deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour: and hath not
slandered his neighbour. Psalm 15, v. 1

it were to his own hindrance. He that hath not given his money upon
usury: nor taken reward against the innocent. Whoso doeth these things:

ends of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun: which
cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a
giant to run his course. Psalm 19, v. 1

testimony of the Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple. The
statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: the commandment
of the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes. The fear of the
Lord is clean, and endureth for ever: the judgements of the Lord are
true, and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold,
yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey, and the honey-comb.
Psalm 19, v. 7

Who can tell how oft he offendeth: O cleanse thou me from my secret
faults. Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the

offence. Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart: be
alway acceptable in thy sight, O Lord: my strength, and my redeemer.

are not able to perform. Psalm 21, v. 11

from my health, and from the words of my complaint? O my God, I cry in
the day-time, but thou hearest not: and in the night-season also I take
no rest. Psalm 22, v. 1

side. Psalm 22, v. 12

fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort me.

loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I

away through my daily complaining. Psalm 32, v. 2

For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a
time when thou mayest be found: but in the great water-floods they shall
not come nigh him. Psalm 32, v. 7

I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go: and
I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not like to horse and mule, which

green bay-tree. I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him, but his
place could no where be found. Keep innocency, and take heed unto the
thing that is right: for that shall bring a man peace at the last. Psalm
37, v. 36

I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even from good
words; but it was pain and grief to me. My heart was hot within me, and

my bread, hath laid great wait for me. Psalm 41, v. 9 (the Authorized
Version of the Bible has '...hath lifted up his heel against me')

Like as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after
thee, O God. My soul is a thirst for God, yea, even for the living God.

panteth after the water breaks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My

and storms are gone over me. Psalm 42, v. 8

I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me: why

God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed: God
shall help her, and that right early. The heathen make much ado, and the
kingdoms are moved: but God hath shewed his voice, and the earth shall
melt away. The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.
Psalm 46, v. 5

He maketh wars to cease in all the world: he breaketh the bow, and

and I will be exalted in the earth. Psalm 46, v. 9

come after. Psalm 48, v. 11

Wise men also die, and perish together: as well as the ignorant and
foolish, and leave their riches for other. And yet they think that their
houses shall continue for ever: and that their dwelling-places shall
endure from one generation to another; and call the lands after their
own names. Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour: seeing he may be
compared unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them. Psalm 49,

me. But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me
to understand wisdom secretly. Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I
shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou
hast broken may rejoice. Psalm 51, v. 5.

give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free
Spirit. Psalm 51, v. 10

Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God.

Psalm 51, v. 14

Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy praise. For
thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou
delightest not in burntofferings. The sacrifice of God is a troubled
spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise. O be
favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Psalm 51, v. 15

Then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine altar. Psalm 51, v. 19

rest. Psalm 55, v. 6

over-past. Psalm 57, v. 1

God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among lions. And I
lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth
are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. Set up thyself, O
God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth. They have
laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they have digged a pit
before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves. Psalm 57, v.
4

Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I myself will awake right
early. Psalm 57, v. 9

They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent: even like the deaf
adder that stoppeth her ears; Which refuseth to hear the voice of the
charmer: charm he never so wisely. Psalm 58, v. 4

Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my
head; Judah is my law-giver; Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast
out my shoe: Philistia, be thou glad of me. Psalm 60, v. 7

Their delight is in lies; they give good words with their mouth, but
curse with their heart.

Psalm 62, v. 4

As for the children of men, they are but vanity: the children of men are
deceitful upon the weights, they are altogether lighter than vanity
itself. O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselves unto
vanity: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them. God spake
once, and twice I have also heard the same: that power belongeth unto
God; And that thou, Lord, art merciful: for thou rewardest every man
according to his work. Psalm 62, v. 9

barren and dry land where no water is. Psalm 63, v. 2

Let them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be a portion for
foxes. Psalm 63, v. 10

performed in Jerusalem. Thou that hearest the prayer: unto thee shall
all flesh come. Psalm 65, v. 1

remain in the broad sea. Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains:
and is girded about with power. Who stilleth the raging of the sea: and
the noise of his waves, and the madness of the people. Psalm 65, v. 5

Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very plenteous.
Psalm 65, v. 9

Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys
thereof: thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the
increase of it. Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds
drop fatness. They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and
the little hills shall rejoice on every side. The folds shall be full of
sheep: the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn, that they shall
laugh and sing. Psalm 65, v. 11

God be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his
countenance, and be merciful unto us; That thy way may be known upon
earth: thy saving health among all nations. Let the people praise thee,

Psalm 68, v. 1

O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his name: magnify him that rideth
upon the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise him in his name JAH,
and rejoice before him. He is a Father of the fatherless, and defendeth
the cause of the widows: even God in his holy habitation. He is the God
that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the
prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates continue in
scarceness. O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou
wentest through the wilderness, The earth shook, and the heavens dropped
at the presence of God. Psalm 68, v. 4

The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers. Kings
with their armies did flee, kand were discomfited: and they of the
household divided the spoil. Though ye have lien among the pots, yet
shall ye be as the wings of a dove: that is covered with silver wings,
and her feathers like gold. Psalm 68, v. 11

Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in which it pleaseth
him to dwell. Psalm 68, v. 16

Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received
gifts for men. Psalm 68, v. 18

The zeal of thine house hath even eaten me. Psalm 69, v. 9

Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for
some to have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to
comfort me. They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave
me vinegar to drink. Psalm 69, v. 21

69, v. 26

Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be written
among the righteous. Psalm 69, v. 29

turned backward and put to confusion that wish me evil. Let them for

flood unto the world's end. They that dwell in the wilderness shall
kneel before him: his enemies shall lick the dust. The Kings of Tharsis
and of the isles shall give presents: the kings of Arabia and Saba shall
bring gifts. All kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do
him service. Psalm 72, v. 8

He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia. Psalm
72, v. 15

Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no small
advantage. Tush, say they, how should God perceive it: is there
knowledge in the most High? Psalm 73, v. 10

Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me. Until I
went into the sanctuary of God: then understood I the end of these men.

enemies: and forget not the congregation of the poor for ever. Psalm 74,
v. 20

The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the pillars
of it. Psalm 75, v. 4

Which we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told us.

flesh rejoice in the living God. Yea, the sparrow hath found her an
house, and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young: even thy
altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God. Psalm 84, v. 1

Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are thy
ways. Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well: and the
pools are filled with water. They will go from strength to strength: and
unto the God of gods appeareth every one of them in Sion. Psalm 84, v. 5

For one day in thy courts: is better than a thousand. I had rather be a
door-keeper in the house of my God: than to dwell in the tents of
ungodliness. Psalm 84, v. 10

Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us: that thy people may rejoice in
thee? Psalm 85, v. 6

each other. Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness
hath looked down from heaven. Psalm 85, v. 10

Very excellent things are spoken of thee: thou city of God. Psalm 87, v.
2

Lord, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another. Before
the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end. Psalm 90, v.
1

For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is
past as a watch in the night.

As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass. In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but
in the evening it is cut down, dried up, and withered. Psalm 90, v. 4

The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so
strong that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but
labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone. Psalm 90,
v. 10

So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto
wisdom. Psalm 90, v. 12

For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the
noisome pestilence. He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt
be safe under his feathers: his faithfulness and truth shall be thy
shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night:
nor for the arrow that flieth by day; For the pestilence that walketh in
darkness: nor for the sickness that destroyeth in the noon-day. A
thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but
it shall not come nigh thee. Psalm 91, v. 3

For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of defence very
high. There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee:
to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee in their hands: that
thou hurt not thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt go upon the lion and
adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet.

With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation. Psalm 91,

his apparel, and girded himself with strength. He hath made the round
world so sure: that it cannot be moved. Psalm 93, v. 1

The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lift up their voice: the
floods lift up their waves. The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage
horribly: but yet the Lord, who dwelleth on high, is mightier. Thy
testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becometh thine house for
ever. Psalm 93, v. 4

He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the eye,
shall he not see? Psalm 94, v. 9

O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the
strength of our salvation. Let us come before his presence with
thanksgiving: and shew ourselves glad in him with

psalms. Psalm 95, v. 1

In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the
hills is his also. The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands
prepared the dry land. O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel
before the Lord our Maker. For he is the Lord our God: and we are the
people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day if ye will hear
his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the provocation, and as in the
day of temptation in the wilderness; When your fathers tempted me:
proved me, and saw my works. Forty years long was I grieved with this
generation, and said: It is a people that do err in their hearts, for
they have not known my ways; Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they
should not enter into my rest. Psalm 95, v. 4

Ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his Name: bring presents, and
come into his courts. O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let
the whole earth stand in awe of him. Psalm 96, v. 8

the isles may be glad thereof. Psalm 97, v. 1

With his own right hand, and with his holy arm: hath he gotten himself
the victory. Psalm 98, v. 1.

thanksgiving. With trumpets also, and shawms: O shew yourselves joyful
before the Lord the King. Psalm 98, v. 6

With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with equity.
Psalm 98, v. 10

The Lord is King, be the people never so impatient: he sitteth between
the cherubims, be the earth never so unquiet. Psalm 99, v. 1

O be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and
come before his presence with a song. Be ye sure that the Lord he is
God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his
people, and the sheep of his pasture. Psalm 100, v. 1.

I am become like a pelican in the wilderness: and like an owl that is in
the desert. I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that
sitteth alone upon the house-top. Psalm 102, v. 6

Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and
the heavens are the work of thy hands.

They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax old as doth
a garment; And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be
changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. Psalm 102,
v. 25

Praise the Lord, O my soul: and forget not all his benefits. Psalm 103,
v. 2

Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: making thee young and lusty
as an eagle. Psalm 103, v. 5

The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and of great
goodness. He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth he his anger for
ever. Psalm 103, v. 8

For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth: so great is
his mercy also toward them that fear him. Look how wide also the east is
from the west: so far hath he set our sins from us. Yea, like as a
father pitieth his own children: even so is the Lord merciful unto them
that fear him. For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that
we are but dust. The days of man are but as grass: for he flourisheth as
a flower of a field. For as soon as the wind goeth over it,o it is gone:
and the place thereof shall know it no more. Psalm 103, v. 11

Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: and maketh the
clouds his chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind. He maketh
his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire. He laid the
foundations of the earth: that it never should move at any time. Thou
coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment: the waters stand in
the hills. Psalm 104, v. 3

Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass: neither turn
again to cover the earth. He sendeth the springs into the rivers: which
run among the hills. All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild
asses quench their thirst. Beside them shall the fowls of the air have
their habitation: and sing among the branches. Psalm 104, v. 9

He bringeth forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the service
of men; That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh
glad the heart of man: and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and
bread to strengthen man's heart. The trees of the Lord also are full of
sap: even the cedars of Libanus which he hath planted. Psalm 104, v. 14

The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats: and so are the stony
rocks for the conies. He appointed the moon for certain seasons: and the
sun knoweth his going down. Thou makest darkness that it may be night:
wherein all the beasts of the forest do move. The lions roaring after
their prey: do seek their meat from God.

The sun ariseth, and they get them away together: and lay them down in
their dens. Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour: until the
evening. O Lord, how manifold are thy works, in wisdom hast thou made
them all; the earth is full of thy riches. So is the great and wide sea
also: wherein are creeping things innumerable, both small and great
beasts. There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan: whom thou hast
made to take his pastime therein. These wait all upon thee: that thou
mayest give them meat in due season. Psalm 104, v. 18

The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch the
hills, they shall smoke. Psalm 104, v. 32

He had sent a man before them: even Joseph, who was sold to be a
bond-servant; Whose feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into
his soul. Psalm 105, v. 17

The king sent, and delivered him: the prince of the people let him go
free. He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his
substance; That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach
his senators wisdom. Psalm 105, v. 20

Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no credence to
his word; But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not unto the voice
of the Lord. Psalm 106, v. 24

Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring with
their own inventions. Psalm 106, v. 38

O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare
the wonders that he doeth for the children of men! For he satisfieth the
empty soul: and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. Such as sit in
darkness, and in the shadow of death: being fast bound in misery and
iron; Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly
regarded the counsel of the most Highest. Psalm 107, v. 8

Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they were even hard at
death's door. Psalm 107, v. 18

They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their business in
great waters; These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in
the deep. Psalm 107, v. 23

They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are at their
wit's end. So when they cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he
delivereth them out of their distress. For he maketh the storm to cease:
so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad, because they
are at rest: and so he bringeth them unto the heaven where

they would be. Psalm 107, v. 27

The Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, until I make
thine enemies thy footstool. Psalm 110, v. 1

have all they that do thereafter; the praise of it endureth for ever.
Psalm 111, v. 10

A good man is merciful, and lendeth: and will guide his words with
discretion. For he shall never be moved: and the righteous shall be had
in everlasting remembrance. Psalm 112, v. 5

He maketh the barren woman to keep house: and to be a joyful mother of
children. Psalm 113, v. 8

When Israel came out of Egypt: and the house of Jacob from among the
strange people, Judah was his sanctuary: and Israel his dominion. The
sea saw that, and fled: Jordan was driven back. The mountains skipped
like rams: and the little hills like young sheep. Psalm 114, v. 1

Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise.
Psalm 115, v. 1.

They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not. They have
ears, and hear not: noses have they, and smell not. They have hands, and
handle not: feet have they, and walk not: neither speak they through
their throat. Psalm 115, v. 5

The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of hell gat
hold upon me. Psalm 116, v. 3

and my feet from falling. Psalm 116, v. 8

the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. Psalm 116, v. 13

Lord bringeth mighty things to pass. Psalm 118, v. 16

the corner. This is the Lord's doing: and it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath made: we will rejoice and be glad in
it. Psalm 118, v. 22

habitation among the tents of Kedar. Psalm 120, v. 4

I labour for peace, but when I speak unto them therof: they make them
ready to battle. Psalm 120, v. 6

I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh my help. My
help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth. He will
not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keepeth thee will not
sleep. Behold, he that keepeth Israel: shall neither slumber not sleep.

hand; So that the sun shall not burn thee by day: neither the moon by
night. Psalm 121, v. 1.

The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from this time
forth for evermore. Psalm 121, v. 8

I was glad when they said unto me: We will go into the house of the
Lord. Our feet shall stand in thy gates: O Jerusalem. Jerusalem is built
as a city: that is at unity in itself. For thither the tribes go up,
even the tribes of the Lord. Psalm 122, v. 1

O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
Peace be within thy walls: and plenteousness with thy palaces. For my
brethren and companions' sakes: I will wish thee prosperity. Psalm 122,
v. 6

If the Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say: if the
Lord himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us; They
had swallowed us up quick: when they were so wrathfully displeased at
us. Psalm 124, v. 1

the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth. Psalm 124, v. 6.

The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about
his people, from this time forth for evermore. Psalm 125, v. 2

them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue
with joy. Psalm 126, v. 1

tears: shall reap in joy. He that now goeth on his way weeping, and
beareth forth good seed: shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring
his sheaves with him. Psalm 126, v. 5

people. Psalm 135, v. 10

for ever. Psalm 136, v. 1

By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept: when we remembered thee,
O Sion. As for our harps, we hanged them up: upon the trees that are
therein. For they that led us away captive required of us then a song,
and melody, in our heaviness: Sing us one of the songs of Sion. How
shall we sing the Lord's song: in a strange land? If I forget thee, O

thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: yea, if I prefer not
Jerusalem in my mirth. Psalm 137, v. 1

down-sitting, and mine up-rising; thou understandest my thoughts long
before. Psalm 139, v. 1

unto it. Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit: or whither shall I go
then from thy presence? If I climb up into the heaven, thou art there:
if I go down to hell, thou art there also. If I take the wings of the
morning: and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea; Even there also
shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me. If I say,
Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall my night be turned
to day. Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as

telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.

Lord: for his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven and

the praises of God be in their mouth: and a two-edged sword in their
hands; To be avenged of the heathen: and to rebuke the people; To bind
their kings in chains: and their nobles with links of iron. Psalm 149,
v. 5

Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: praise him upon the loud
cymbals. Let every thing that hath breath: praise the Lord. Psalm 150,

What Chekhov saw in our failure to communicate was something positive
and precious: the private silence in which we live, and which enables us
to endure our own solitude. We live, as his characters do, beyond any
tale we happen to enact. 'Myth Makers' (1979) 'Chekhov, a doctor'

On devient moral dés qu'on est malheureux. As soon as one is unhappy one
becomes moral. 'A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs' (Within a Budding
Grove, 1918, translated 1924 by C. K. ScottMoncrieff, vol. 1, p. 290)

Tout ce que nous connaissons de grand nous vient des nerveux. Ce sont
eux et non pas d'autres qui ont fondè les religions et composè les
chefs-d'oeuvre. Jamais le monde ne saura tout ce qu'il leur doit et
surtout ce qu'eux ont souffert pour le lui donner. All the greatest
things we know have come to us from neurotics. It is they and they only
who have founded religions and created great works of art. Never will
the world be conscious of how much it owes to them, nor above all of
what they have suffered in order to bestow their gifts on it. 'Le côtè
de Guermantes' (Guermantes Way, 1921, translated 1925 by C. K.
Scott-Moncrieff, vol. 1, p. 418)

Il n'y a rien comme le dèsir pour empêcher les choses qu'on dit d'avoir
aucune ressemblance avec ce qu'on a dans la pensèe. There is nothing
like desire for preventing the thing one says from bearing any
resemblance to what one has in mind. 'Le côtè de Guermantes' (Guermantes
Way, 1921, translated 1925 by C. K. Scott-Moncrieff, vol. 2, p. 60)

Un artiste n'a pas besoin d'exprimer directement sa pensèe dans son
ouvrage pour que celui-ci en refléte la qualitè; on a même pu dire que
la louange la plus haute de Dieu est dans la nègation de l'athèe qui
trouve la Crèation assez parfaite pour se passer d'un crèateur. An
artist has no need to express his mind directly in his work for it to
express the quality of that mind; it has indeed been said that the
highest praise of God consists in the denial of Him by the atheist, who
finds creation so perfect that it can dispense with a creator. 'Le côtè
de Guermantes' (Guermantes Way, 1921, translated 1925 by C. K.
Scott-Moncrieff, vol. 2, p. 147)

Je portai á mes lévres une cuillerèe du thè oû j'avais laissè s'amollir
un morceau de madeleine... Et tout d'un coup le souvenir m'est apparu.
Ce goût c'ètait celui du petit morceau de madeleine que le dimanche
matin á Combray...ma tante Lèonie m'offrait aprés l'avoir trempè dans
son infusion de thè ou de tilleul. I raised to my lips a spoonful of the
tea in which I had soaked a morsel of cake...And suddenly the memory
returns. The taste was that of the little crumb of madeleine which on
Sunday mornings at Combray...my aunt Lèonie used to give me, dipping it
first in her own cup of real or of lime-flower tea. 'Du côtè de chez

Dire que j'ai gâchè des annèes de ma vie, que j'ai voulu mourir, que
j'ai eu mon plus grand amour, pour une femme qui ne me plaisait pas, qui
n'ètait pas mon genre! To think that I have wasted years of my life,
that I have longed for death, that the greatest love that I have ever
known has been for a woman who did not please me, who was not in my
style! 'Du côtè de chez Swann' (Swann's Way, 1913, translated 1922 by C.

Today we have naming of parts. Japonica Glistens like coral in all of

different words. 'The Primal Scene, as it were' (radio play)

Of course we've all dreamed of reviving the castrati; but it's needed

I always claim the mission workers came out too early to catch any

Nobody cares much at heart about Titian; only there is a strange
undercurrent of everlasting murmur about his name, which means the deep

It ought to be quite as natural and straightforward a matter for a
labourer to take his pension from his parish, because he has deserved
well of his parish, as for a man in higher rank to take his pension from
his country, because he has deserved well of his country. 'Unto this
Last' (1862) preface, 6 (4)

The force of the guinea you have in your pocket depends wholly on the

Boredom is...a vital problem for the moralist, since half the sins of
mankind are caused by the fear of it.

'The Conquest of Happiness' (1930) ch. 4

One of the symptoms of approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that
one's work is terribly important, and that to take a holiday would bring
all kinds of disaster. If I were a medical man, I should prescribe a
holiday to any patient who considered his work important. 'The Conquest
of Happiness' (1930) ch. 5

One should as a rule respect public opinion in so far as is necessary to
avoid starvation and to keep out of prison, but anything that goes
beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny, and is
likely to interfere with happiness in all kinds of ways. 'The Conquest
of Happiness' (1930) ch. 9

A sense of duty is useful in work, but offensive in personal relations.
People wish to be liked, not to be endured with patient resignation.

Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to
true happiness. 'The Conquest of Happiness' (1930) ch. 12

Mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we
are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true. 'Mysticism

The law of causality, I believe, like mud that passes muster among
philosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy,
only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm. 'Mysticism and
Logic' (1919)

Only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul's

The infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to
moralists. That is why they invented Hell. 'Sceptical Essays' (1928) 'On
the Value of Scepticism'

It is obvious that 'obscenity' is not a term capable of exact legal
definition; in the practice of the Courts, it means 'anything that
shocks the magistrate'. 'Sceptical Essays' (1928) 'Recrudescence of

Next to enjoying ourselves, the next greatest pleasure consists in
preventing others from

don't feel like going into it. 'The Catcher in the Rye' (1951) ch. 1

Sex is something I really don't understand too hot. You never know where

Take most people, they're crazy about cars. They worry if they get a
little scratch on them, and they're always talking about how many miles
they get to a gallon, and if they get a brand-new car already they start
thinking about trading it in for one that's even newer. I don't even
like old cars. I mean they don't even interest me. I'd rather have a
goddam horse. A horse is at least human, for God's sake. 'The Catcher in
the Rye' (1951) ch. 17

I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big
field of rye and all...I mean if they're running and they don't look

That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye.

life, the dullness of our senses, the torpor of our indifference, the
futility of our occupation, suffer us to know but little: and that
little is soon shaken and then torn from the mind by that traitor to

A great deal of misapprehension arises from the popular use of maps on a
small scale. As with such maps you are able to put a thumb on India and
a finger on Russia, some persons at once think that the political
situation is alarming and that India must be looked to. If the noble
Lord would use a larger map---say one on the scale of the Ordnance Map
of England---he would find that the distance between Russia and British
India is not to be measured by the finger and thumb, but by a rule.
House of Commons, 11 June 1877

No lesson seems to be so deeply inculcated by the experience of life as
that you never should trust experts. If you believe the doctors, nothing
is wholesome: if you believe the theologians, nothing is innocent: if
you believe the soldiers, nothing is safe. They all require to have
their strong wine diluted by a very large admixture of insipid common
sense. Letter to Lord Lytton, 15 June 1877, in Lady Gwendolen Cecil

Where property is in question I am guilty...of erecting individual
liberty as an idol, and of resenting all attempts to destroy or fetter
it; but when you pass from liberty to life, in no wellgoverned State, in
no State governed according to the principles of common humanity, are
the claims of mere liberty allowed to endanger the lives of the

another word fails me, instead my tongue freezes into silence, and at
once a gentle fire has caught throughout my flesh, and I see nothing
with my eyes, and there's a drumming in my ears, and sweat pours down
me, and trembling seizes all of me, and I become paler than grass, and I
seem to fail almost to the point of death in my very self. No. 199 in D.

poop was beaten gold, Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that The winds
were love-sick with them, the oars were silver, Which to the tune of
flutes kept stroke, and made The water which they beat to follow faster,
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, It beggared all
description; she did lie In her pavilion,---cloth-of-gold of tissue,---

O'er-picturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature; on each
side her Stood pretty-dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, With

eyes, And made their bends adornings; at the helm A seeming mermaid
steers; the silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flower-soft
hands, That yarely frame the office. From the barge A strange invisible
perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast Her people
out upon her, and Antony, Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,

Cleopatra too And made a gap in nature. 'Antony and Cleopatra' (1606-7)

high as it is, and moves with its own organs; it lives by that which
nourisheth it; and the elements once out of it, it transmigrates.
Lepidus: What colour is it of? Antony: Of its own colour too. Lepidus:

Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp?
Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court? Here
feel we but the penalty of Adam, The seasons' difference; as, the icy
fang

And churlish chiding of the winter's wind, Which, when it bites and
blows upon my body, Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say, 'This
is no flattery.' 'As You Like It' (1599) act 2, sc. 1, l. 2

Sweet are the uses of adversity, Which like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head; And this our life, exempt from
public haunt, Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones, and good in everything. 'As You Like It' (1599) act
2, sc. 1, l. 12

O good old man! how well in thee appears The constant service of the
antique world, When service sweat for duty, not for meed! Thou art not
for the fashion of these times, Where none will sweat but for promotion,
And having that, do choke their service up Even with the having. 'As You
Like It' (1599) act 2, sc. 3, l. 56

Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I. When I was at home I was in a
better place; but travellers must be content. 'As You Like It' (1599)

In thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight
pillow. 'As You Like It' (1599) act 2, sc. 4, l. \[26\]

If thou remember'st not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee
run into, Thou hast not loved. 'As You Like It' (1599) act 2, sc. 4, l.

first-born of Egypt. 'As You Like It' (1599) act 2, sc. 5, l. \[60\]

And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe, And then from hour to hour,
we rot and rot: And thereby hangs a tale. 'As You Like It' (1599) act 2,
sc. 7, l. 26

My lungs began to crow like chanticleer, That fools should be so
deep-contemplative, And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his
dial. O noble fool! A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear. 'As You Like
It' (1599) act 2, sc. 7, l. 30

O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier, And says, if ladies be but
young and fair, They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,---
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage,---he hath
strange places crammed With observation, the which he vents In mangled
forms.

'As You Like It' (1599) act 2, sc. 7, l. 36

I must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on
whom I please. 'As You Like It' (1599) act 2, sc. 7, l. 47

All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players: They
have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many
parts, His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and
puking in the nurse's arms. And then the whining schoolboy, with his
satchel, And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to
school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths,
and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in
quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And
then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes
severe, and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and
slippered pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His
youthful hose well saved a world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his
big manly voice, Turning again towards childish treble, pipes And
whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange
eventful history, Is second childishness, and mere oblivion, Sans teeth,
sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. 'As You Like It' (1599) act 2,
sc. 7, l. 139

Blow, blow, thou winter wind, Thou art not so unkind As man's
ingratitude: Thy tooth is not so keen, Because thou art not seen,
Although thy breath be rude.

Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly: Most friendship is
feigning, most loving mere folly. Then heigh-ho! the holly! This life is
most jolly. Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky, That dost not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot: Though thou the waters warp, Thy sting is not so
sharp As friend remembered not. 'As You Like It' (1599) act 2, sc. 7, l.
174

Run, run, Orlando: carve on every tree The fair, the chaste, and

Rosalind: Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and wear strange

Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour, and like enough

You come most carefully upon your hour. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 1, l.
6

For this relief much thanks; 'tis bitter cold And I am sick at heart.
'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 1, l. 8

Not a mouse stirring. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 1, l. 10

Bernardo: What! is Horatio there? Horatio: A piece of him. 'Hamlet'
(1601) act 1, sc. 1, l. 19

What! has this thing appeared again to-night? 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc.
1, l. 21

Look, where it comes again! 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 1, l. 40

But in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange
eruption to our state. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 1, l. 68

This sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day.
'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 1, l. 77

In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest
Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak
and gibber in the Roman streets. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 1, l. 113

I'll cross it, though it blast me. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 1, l. 127

And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. 'Hamlet'
(1601) act 1, sc. 1, l. 148

It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever 'gainst that
season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,

The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, no
spirit can walk abroad; The nights are wholesome; then no planets
strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallowed and
so gracious is the time. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 1, l. 157

But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon
high eastern hill. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 1, l. 166

Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green...
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,... Have we, as 'twere with
a defeated joy, With one auspicious and one dropping eye, With mirth in
funeral and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and
dole, Taken to wife. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l. 1

The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to
the brain, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. 'Hamlet' (1601)
act 1, sc. 2, l. 47

A little more than kin, and less than kind. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc.
2, l. 65

Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2,
l. 67

Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, And let thine eye look like a
friend on Denmark. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l. 68

Queen: Thou know'st 'tis common; all that live must die, Passing through
nature to eternity. Hamlet: Ay, madam, it is common. 'Hamlet' (1601) act
1, sc. 2, l. 72

Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not 'seems'. 'Tis not alone my inky
cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy
suspiration of forced breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor
the dejected 'haviour of the visage, Together with all forms, modes,
shows of grief,

That can denote me truly; these indeed seem, For they are actions that a
man might play: But I have that within which passeth show; These but the
trappings and the suits of woe. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l. 76

But to persever In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious
stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to
heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1,
sc. 2, l. 92

Hamlet: I shall in all my best obey you, madam. King: Why, 'tis a loving
and a fair reply. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l. 120

O! that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw, and resolve itself
into a dew; Or that the Everlasting had not fixed His canon 'gainst
self-slaughter! O God! O God! How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
Seem to me all the uses of this world. Fie on't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded
garden, That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it
merely. That it should come to this! But two months dead: nay, not so
much, not two: So excellent a king; that was, to this, Hyperion to a
satyr: so loving to my mother, That he might not beteem the winds of
heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember?
Why, she would hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what
it fed on; and yet, within a month, Let me not think on't: Frailty, thy
name is woman! A little month; or ere those shoes were old With which
she followed my poor father's body, Like Niobe, all tears; why she, even
she,--- O God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason, Would have
mourned longer,---married with mine uncle, My father's brother, but no
more like my father Than I to Hercules. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l.
129

It is not, nor it cannot come to good; But break, my heart, for I must
hold my tongue! 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l. 158

A truant disposition, good my lord. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l. 169

We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc.
2, l. 175

Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish
forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Ere
I had ever seen that day, Horatio! 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l. 180

He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like
again. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l. 187

In the dead vast and middle of the night. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2,
l. 198

These hands are not more like. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l. 212

But answer made it none. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l. 215

A countenance more in sorrow than in anger. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc.
2, l. 231

While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred. 'Hamlet' (1601) act
1, sc. 2, l. 237

Hamlet: His beard was grizzléd, no? Horatio: It was, as I have seen it
in his life, A sable silvered. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l. 239

Give it an understanding, but no tongue. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2,
l. 249

All is not well; I doubt some foul play. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2,
l. 254

Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's
eyes. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 2, l. 256

And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger
of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough

If she unmask her beauty to the moon. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 3, l.
34

Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way
to heaven, Whiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine, Himself the
primrose path of dalliance treads, And recks not his own rede. 'Hamlet'
(1601) act 1, sc. 3, l. 47

And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character. Give thy
thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportioned thought his act. Be thou
familiar, but by no means vulgar; The friends thou hast, and their
adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not
dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatched, unfledged comrade.
Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in, Bear't that th' opposéd
may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice; Take
each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy
purse can buy, But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the
apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and
station Are most select and generous, chief in that. Neither a borrower,
nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And
borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry, This above all: to thine own self
be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then
be false to any man. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 3, l. 58

You speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 3, l. 101

Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know, When the blood burns, how
prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter, Giving
more light than heat, extinct in both, Even in their promise, as it is
a-making,

You must not take for fire. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 3, l. 115

Hamlet: The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. Horatio: It is a
nipping and an eager air. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 4, l. 1

But to my mind,---though I am native here, And to the manner born,---it
is a custom More honoured in the breach than the observance. 'Hamlet'
(1601) act 1, sc. 4, l. 14

Angels and ministers of grace defend us! Be thou a spirit of health or
goblin damned, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be
thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou com'st in such a questionable
shape That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet, King, father;
royal Dane, O! answer me: Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell Why
thy canonized bones hearséd in death, Have burst their cerements; why
the sepulchre, Wherein we saw thee quietly inurned, Hath oped his
ponderous and marble jaws, To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse again in complete steel Revisit'st thus the
glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous; and we fools of nature So
horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of
our souls? 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 4, l. 39

I do not set my life at a pin's fee; And for my soul, what can it do to
that, Being a thing immortal as itself? 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 4, l.
65

Unhand me, gentlemen, By heaven! I'll make a ghost of him that lets me.
'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 4, l. 84

Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc.
4, l. 90

Alas! poor ghost. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. 4

I am thy father's spirit;

Doomed for a certain term to walk the night. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc.
5, l. 9

But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a
tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy
young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combinéd locks to part, And each particular hair to
stand an end, Like quills upon the fretful porpentine: But this eternal
blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. 13

Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc.
5, l. 25

Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange, and
unnatural. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. 27

And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That rots itself in ease
on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1,
sc. 5, l. 32

O my prophetic soul! My uncle! 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. 40

But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc.
5, l. 58

In the porches of mine ears. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. 63

Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand, Of life, of crown, of queen,
at once dispatched; Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhouseled,
disappointed, unaneled, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With
all my imperfections on my head: O, horrible! O, horrible! most
horrible! If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not. 'Hamlet' (1601) act
1, sc. 5, l. 74

Leave her to heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,

To prick and sting her. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. 86

The glow-worm shows the matin to be near, And 'gins to pale his
uneffectual fire. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. 89

Remember thee! Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this
distracted globe. Remember thee! Yea, from the table of my memory I'll
wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all
pressures past, That youth and observation copied there. 'Hamlet' (1601)
act 1, sc. 5, l. 95

O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damnéd villain! My
tables,---meet it is I set it down, That one may smile, and smile, and
be a villain; At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark. 'Hamlet' (1601)
act 1, sc. 5, l. 105

Hamlet: There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark, But he's an
arrant knave. Horatio: There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the
grave, To tell us this. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. 123

These are but wild and whirling words, my lord. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1,
sc. 5, l. 133

It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc.
5, l. 138

Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc.
5, l. 156

Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast? 'Hamlet' (1601)
act 1, sc. 5, l. 162

O day and night, but this is wondrous strange! 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1,
sc. 5, l. 164

There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of
in your philosophy. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. 166

To put an antic disposition on. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. 172

Rest, rest, perturbéd spirit.

'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. 182

The time is out of joint; O curséd spite, That ever I was born to set it
right! 'Hamlet' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. 188

By indirections find directions out. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 1, l. 66

Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced; No hat upon his head; his
stockings fouled, Ungartered, and down-gyvéd to his ancle. 'Hamlet'
(1601) act 2, sc. 1, l. 78

This is the very ecstasy of love. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 1, l. 101

Brevity is the soul of wit. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. 90

To define true madness, What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. 93

More matter with less art. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. 95

That he is mad, 'tis true; 'tis true 'tis pity; And pity 'tis 'tis true:
a foolish figure; But farewell it, for I will use no art. 'Hamlet'
(1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. 97

That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile phrase.
'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[110\]

Doubt thou the stars are fire; Doubt that the sun doth move; Doubt truth
to be a liar; But never doubt I love. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l.
\[115\]

Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2,
l. \[141\]

And he, repulséd,---a short tale to make,--- Fell into a sadness, then
into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a
lightness; and by this declension Into the madness wherein now he raves,
And all we wail for. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[146\]

Let me be no assistant for a state,

But keep a farm, and carters. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[166\]

Polonius: Do you know me, my lord? Hamlet: Excellent well; you are a
fishmonger. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[173\]

Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out
of ten thousand. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[179\]

Still harping on my daughter. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[190\]

Polonius: What do you read, my lord? Hamlet: Words, words, words.
'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[195\]

The satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards, that their
faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum,
and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak
hams: all of which, sir, though I most potently and powerfully believe,
yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down. 'Hamlet' (1601) act
2, sc. 2, l. \[201\]

Though this be madness, yet there is method in't. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2,
sc. 2, l. \[211\]

Polonius: My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
Hamlet: You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more
willingly part withal; except my life, except my life, except my life.
'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[221\]

Guildenstern: On Fortune's cap we are not the very button. Hamlet: Nor
the soles of her shoe? Rosencrantz: Neither, my lord. Hamlet: Then you
live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours? Guildenstern:
Faith, her privates, we. Hamlet: In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most
true; she is a strumpet. What news? Rosencrantz: None, my lord, but that
the world's grown honest. Hamlet: Then is doomsday near. 'Hamlet' (1601)
act 2, sc. 2, l. \[237\]

There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. 'Hamlet'
(1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[259\]

O God! I could be bounded in a nut-shell, and count myself a king of
infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams. 'Hamlet' (1601) act
2, sc. 2, l. \[263\]

Beggar that I am, I am poor even in thanks. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc.
2, l. \[286\]

It goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth, seems to me a sterile

promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire,
why, it appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent
congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! How noble in
reason! how infinite in faculty! in form, in moving, how express and
admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god!
the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is
this quintessence of dust? man delights not me; no, nor woman neither,
though, by your smiling, you seem to say so. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc.
2, l. \[316\]

He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall have tribute
of me. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[341\]

There is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find
it out. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[392\]

I am but mad north-north-west; when the wind is southerly, I know a hawk
from a handsaw. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[405\]

The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history,
pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem
unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. 'Hamlet'
(1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[424\]

One fair daughter and no more, The which he loved passing well. 'Hamlet'
(1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[435\]

Come, give us a taste of your quality. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l.
\[460\]

The play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the
general. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[465\]

Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let
them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of
the time: after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their
ill report while you live. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[553\]

Use every man after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping? 'Hamlet'
(1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[561\]

O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I: Is it not monstrous that this
player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his
soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wanned,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in 's aspect, A broken voice, and his
whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
For Hecuba!

What's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba That he should weep for her?
'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[584\]

He would drown the stage with tears, And cleave the general ear with
horrid speech, Make mad the guilty, and appal the free, Confound the
ignorant, and amaze, indeed, The very faculties of eyes and ears.
'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[596\]

I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant
of my cause, And can say nothing. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l.
\[601\]

Am I a coward? Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? Plucks off
my beard and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the
lie i' the throat, As deep as to the lungs? 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc.
2, l. \[606\]

But I am pigeon-livered, and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere
this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave's offal.
Bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless
villain! 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[613\]

I have heard, That guilty creatures sitting at a play Have by the very
cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have
proclaimed their malefactions; For murder, though it have no tongue,
will speak With most miraculous organ. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l.
\[625\]

The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
'Hamlet' (1601) act 2, sc. 2, l. \[641\]

'Tis too much proved---that with devotion's visage And pious action, we
do sugar o'er The devil himself.

'Hamlet' (1601) act 3, sc. 1, l. 47

To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the
mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take
arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die: to
sleep; No more; and, by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the
thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream:
ay, there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause. There's
the respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the
whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's
contumely, The pangs of disprized love, the law's delay, The insolence
of office, and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When
he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels
bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of
something after death, The undiscovered country from whose bourn No
traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills
we have, Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience doth
make cowards of us all; And thus the native hue of resolution Is
sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great
pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the
name of action. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 3, sc. 1, l. 56

Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remembered. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 3,
sc. 1, l. 89

For, to the noble mind, Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.

'Hamlet' (1601) act 3, sc. 1, l. 100

Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am
myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that
it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful,
ambitious; with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put
them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What
should such fellows as I do crawling between heaven and earth? We are
arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 3, sc. 1, l.
\[124\]

Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go; farewell. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 3, sc.
1, l. \[142\]

I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given you one
face and you make yourselves another. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 3, sc. 1, l.
\[150\]

I say, we will have no more marriages. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 3, sc. 1, l.
\[156\]

O! what a noble mind is here o'erthrown: The courtier's, soldier's,
scholar's, eye, tongue, sword; The expectancy and rose of the fair
state, The glass of fashion, and the mould of form, The observéd of all
observers, quite, quite, down! And I, of ladies most deject and
wretched, That sucked the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble
and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and
harsh; That unmatched form and figure of blown youth, Blasted with
ecstasy: O! woe is me, To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
'Hamlet' (1601) act 3, sc. 1, l. \[159\]

Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on
the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as
lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with
your hand, thus; but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest,
and---as I may say---whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a
temperance, that may give it smoothness. O! it offends me to the soul to
hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part
are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise: I would
have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod:
pray you, avoid it. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 3, sc. 2, l. 1

Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit
the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special
observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything so
overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first
and now,

was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue
her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the
time his form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off,
though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
grieve; the censure of which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a
whole theatre of others. O! there be players that I have seen play, and
heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that,
neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian,
pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some
of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well, they
imitated humanity so abominably. 'Hamlet' (1601) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[19\]

Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my

A good sherris-sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It ascends me into
the brain; dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapours
which environ it; makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of
nimble fiery and delectable shapes; which, delivered o'er to the voice,
the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second
property of your excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood; which,
before cold and settled, left the liver white and pale, which is the
badge of pusillanimity and cowardice: but the sherris warms it and makes
it course from the inwards to the parts extreme. It illumineth the face,
which, as a beacon, gives warning to all the rest of this little
kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and inland petty
spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who, great and puffed
up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour comes of
sherris. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that
sets it a-work; and learning, a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till
sack commences it and sets it in act and use. 'Henry IV, Part 2' (1597)

Can this cockpit hold The vasty fields of France? or may we cram Within

For so work the honey-bees, Creatures that by a rule in nature teach The
act of order to a peopled kingdom. They have a king and officers of
sorts; Where some, like magistrates, correct at home, Others, like
merchants, venture trade abroad, Others, like soldiers, arméd in their
stings, Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds; Which pillage they with
merry march bring home To the tent-royal of their emperor:

Who, busied in his majesty, surveys The singing masons building roofs of
gold, The civil citizens kneading up the honey, The poor mechanic
porters crowding in Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate, The sad-eyed
justice, with his surly hum, Delivering o'er to executors pale The lazy
yawning drone. 'Henry V' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. 187

Now all the youth of England are on fire, And silken dalliance in the
wardrobe lies; Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought Reigns
solely in the breast of every man: They sell the pasture now to buy the

as English Mercuries. For now sits Expectation in the air And hides a
sword from hilts unto the point With crowns imperial, crowns and
coronets, Promised to Harry and his followers. 'Henry V' (1599) act 2,

after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile
upon his fingers' ends, I knew there was but one way; for his nose was
as sharp as a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'Henry V' (1599) act

So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or four times: now I, to comfort

Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or close the wall up
with our English dead! In peace there's nothing so becomes a man As
modest stillness and humility: But when the blast of war blows in our
ears, Then imitate the action of the tiger; Stiffen the sinews, summon
up the blood, Disguise fair nature with hard-favoured rage; Then lend
the eye a terrible aspect. 'Henry V' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l. 1

On, on you noblest English! Whose blood is fet from fathers of

Now entertain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring
dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe. From camp to camp, through
the foul womb of night, The hum of either army stilly sounds, That the
fixed sentinels almost receive The secret whispers of each other's
watch. Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames Each battle sees
the other's umbered face: Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful
neighs Piercing the night's dull ear; and from the tents The armourers,
accomplishing the knights, With busy hammers closing rivets up, Give
dreadful note of preparation. 'Henry V' (1599) act 4, chorus, l. 1

He which hath no stomach to this fight, Let him depart; his passport

day is called the feast of Crispian: He that outlives this day and comes
safe home,

Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named, And rouse him at the name
of Crispian. He that shall live this day, and see old age, Will yearly
on the vigil feast his neighbours, And say, 'To-morrow is Saint
Crispian:' Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars, And say,
'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.' Old men forget: yet all shall be
forgot, But he'll remember with advantages What feats he did that day.
Then shall our names, Familiar in his mouth as household words, Harry
the King, Bedford and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and
Gloucester, Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered. This story
shall the good man teach his son; And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go
by, From this day to the ending of the world, But we in it shall be
rememberéd; We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he to-day
that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile
This day shall gentle his condition: And gentlemen in England, now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here, And hold their
manhoods cheap whiles any speaks That fought with us upon Saint
Crispin's day. 'Henry V' (1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 35

Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen, Our bending author hath pursued
the story, In little room confining mighty men, Mangling by starts the
full course of their glory. Small time, but in that small most greatly
lived This star of England. Fortune made his sword, By which the world's
best garden he achieved,

And of it made his son imperial lord. Henry the Sixth, in infant bands
crowned King Of France and England, did this king succeed, Whose state
so many had the managing That they lost France and made this England
bleed; Which oft our stage hath shown; and for their sake In your fair
minds let this acceptance take. 'Henry V' (1599) epilogue

I shall fall Like a bright exhalation in the evening, And no man see me
more. 'Henry VIII' (1613) act 3, sc. 2, l. 226

In all you writ to Rome, or else To foreign princes, Ego et Rex meus Was
still inscribed; in which you brought the king To be your servant.
'Henry VIII' (1613) act 3, sc. 2, l. 313

Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness! This is the state of
man: to-day he puts forth The tender leaves of hope; to-morrow blossoms,
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him; The third day comes a
frost, a killing frost; And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root, And then he falls, as I do.
I have ventured, Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders, This
many summers in a sea of glory, But far beyond my depth: my high-blown
pride At length broke under me, and now has left me Weary and old with
service, to the mercy Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me. Vain
pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:

I feel my heart new opened. O how wretched Is that poor man that hangs
on princes' favours! There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin, More pangs and fears than
wars or women have; And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer, Never to
hope again. 'Henry VIII' (1613) act 3, sc. 2, l. 352

A peace above all earthly dignities, A still and quiet conscience.
'Henry VIII' (1613) act 3, sc. 2, l. 380

A load would sink a navy. 'Henry VIII' (1613) act 3, sc. 2, l. 384

Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition: By that sin fell the
angels; how can man then, The image of his Maker, hope to win by't? Love
thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee; Corruption wins not
more than honesty. Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace, To
silence envious tongues: be just, and fear not. Let all the ends thou
aim'st at be thy country's, Thy God's, and truth's: then if thou
fall'st, O Cromwell! Thou fall'st a blessed martyr. 'Henry VIII' (1613)
act 3, sc. 2, l. 441

Had I but served my God with half the zeal I served my king, he would
not in mine age Have left me naked to mine enemies. 'Henry VIII' (1613)
act 3, sc. 2, l. 456

She had all the royal makings of a queen. 'Henry VIII' (1613) act 4, sc.
1, l. 87

An old man, broken with the storms of state Is come to lay his weary
bones among ye; Give him a little earth for charity. 'Henry VIII' (1613)
act 4, sc. 2, l. 21

He gave his honours to the world again, His blessed part to Heaven, and
slept in peace. 'Henry VIII' (1613) act 4, sc. 2, l. 29

So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him! 'Henry VIII' (1613) act 4,
sc. 2, l. 31

He was a man

Of an unbounded stomach. 'Henry VIII' (1613) act 4, sc. 2, l. 33

His promises were, as he then was, mighty; But his performance, as he is
now, nothing. 'Henry VIII' (1613) act 4, sc. 2, l. 41

Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues We write in water.
'Henry VIII' (1613) act 4, sc. 2, l. 45

He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one; Exceeding wise, fair-spoken,
and persuading: Lofty and sour to them that loved him not; But, to those
men that sought him, sweet as summer. 'Henry VIII' (1613) act 4, sc. 2,
l. 51

Those twins of learning that he raised in you, Ipswich and Oxford!
'Henry VIII' (1613) act 4, sc. 2, l. 58

After my death I wish no other herald, No other speaker of my living
actions, To keep mine honour from corruption, Than such an honest
chronicler as Griffith. 'Henry VIII' (1613) act 4, sc. 2, l. 69

I had thought They had parted so much honesty among 'em,--- At least,
good manners,---as not thus to suffer A man of his place, and so near
our favour, To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures, And at
the door too, like a post with packets. 'Henry VIII' (1613) act 5, sc.
2, l. 26

'Tis a cruelty To load a falling man. 'Henry VIII' (1613) act 5, sc. 2,
l. /76

In her days every man shall eat in safety Under his own vine what he
plants; and sing The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours. 'Henry
VIII' (1613) act 5, sc. 5, l. 34

Those about her From her shall read the perfect ways of honour. 'Henry
VIII' (1613) act 5, sc. 5, l. 37

Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when The bird of wonder
dies, the maiden phoenix,

Her ashes new-create another heir As great in admiration as herself.
'Henry VIII' (1613) act 5, sc. 5, l. 40

Some come to take their ease And sleep an act or two. 'Henry VIII'

7.66.15 Julius Caesar

Hence! home, you idle creatures, get you home: Is this a holiday?
'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 1, l. 1

You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things! O you hard
hearts, you cruel men of Rome, Knew you not Pompey? 'Julius Caesar'
(1599) act 1, sc. 1, l. \[39\]

Caesar: Who is it in the press that calls on me? I hear a tongue,
shriller than all the music, Cry 'Caesar'. Speak; Caesar is turned to
hear. Soothsayer: Beware the ides of March. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act
1, sc. 2, l. 15

He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1,
sc. 2, l. 24

I am not gamesome: I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in
Antony. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. 28

Brutus, I do observe you now of late: I have not from your eyes that
gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have: You bear too stubborn
and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you. 'Julius Caesar'
(1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. 32

Poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the shows of love to other
men. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. 46

Set honour in one eye and death i' the other, And I will look on both
indifferently. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. 86

Well, honour is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and
other men Think of this life: but, for my single self,

I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself.
'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. 92

I was born free as Caesar; so were you: We both have fed as well, and we
can both Endure the winter's cold as well as he: For once, upon a raw
and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said
to me, 'Dar'st thou, Cassius, now, Leap in with me into this angry
flood, And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word, Accoutréd as I was, I
plungéd in, And bade him follow... But ere we could arrive the point
proposed, Caesar cried, 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!' I, as Aeneas, our
great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old
Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And
this man Is now become a god. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. 97

He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did
mark How he did shake; 'tis true, this god did shake; His coward lips
did from their colour fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the
world Did lose his lustre. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. 119

Ye gods, it doth amaze me, A man of such a feeble temper should So get
the start of the majestic world, And bear the palm alone. 'Julius
Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. 128

Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus; and we
petty men Walk under his huge legs, and peep about To find ourselves
dishonourable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates: The
fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are
underlings.

'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. 134

'Brutus' will start a spirit as soon as 'Caesar'. Now in the names of
all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed, That he
is grown so great? 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. 146

When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walls
encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed and room enough, When
there is in it but one only man. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l.
153

Let me have men about me that are fat; Sleek-headed men and such as
sleep o' nights; Yond' Cassius has a lean and hungry look; He thinks too
much: such men are dangerous. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l.
191

Would he were fatter! but I fear him not: Yet if my name were liable to
fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare
Cassius. He reads much; He is a great observer, and he looks Quite
through the deeds of men; he loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony; he
hears no music; Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he
mocked himself, and scorned his spirit, That could be moved to smile at
anything. Such men as he be never at heart's ease, Whiles they behold a
greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather
tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.
'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. 197

'Tis very like: he hath the falling sickness. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act
1, sc. 2, l. \[255\]

Cassius: Did Cicero say any thing? Casca: Ay, he spoke Greek. Cassius:
To what effect? Casca: Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i'
the face again; but those that understood him smiled at one another and
shook their heads; but, for mine own part, it was Greek to me. 'Julius
Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 2, l. \[282\]

Yesterday the bird of night did sit, Even at noon-day, upon the
market-place, Hooting and shrieking. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc.
3, l. 26

Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1,
sc. 3, l. 90

Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, Nor airless dungeon, nor
strong links of iron, Can be retentive to the strength of spirit; But
life, being weary of these worldly bars, Never lacks power to dismiss
itself. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 1, sc. 3, l. 93

It is the bright day that brings forth the adder; And that craves wary
walking. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc. 1, l. 14

'Tis a common proof, That lowliness is young ambition's ladder, Whereto
the climber-upward turns his face; But when he once attains the upmost
round, He then unto the ladder turns his back, Looks in the clouds,
scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend. 'Julius Caesar' (1599)
act 2, sc. 1, l. 21

Between the acting of a dreadful thing And the first motion, all the
interim is Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream: The genius and the
mortal instruments Are then in council; and the state of man, Like to a
little kingdom, suffers then The nature of an insurrection. 'Julius
Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc. 1, l. 63

O conspiracy! Sham'st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night, When
evils are most free? 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc. 1, l. 77

Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius. 'Julius Caesar' (1599)
act 2, sc. 1, l. 166

Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods, Not hew him as a carcass fit
for hounds. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc. 1, l. 173

For he is superstitious grown of late, Quite from the main opinion he
held once Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies. 'Julius Caesar' (1599)
act 2, sc. 1, l. 195

But when I tell him he hates flatterers, He says he does, being then
most flattered. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc. 1, l. 207

Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc.
1, l. 230

What! is Brutus sick, And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To dare
the vile contagion of the night? 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc. 1, l.
263

That great vow Which did incorporate and make us one. 'Julius Caesar'
(1599) act 2, sc. 1, l. 272

Portia: Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure? If it be no
more, Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife. Brutus: You are my true
and honourable wife, As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my
sad heart. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc. 1, l. 285

I grant I am a woman, but, withal, A woman that Lord Brutus took to
wife; I grant I am a woman, but, withal, A woman well-reputed, Cato's
daughter. Think you I am no stronger than my sex, Being so fathered and
so husbanded? 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc. 1, l. 292

Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night. 'Julius Caesar' (1599)
act 2, sc. 2, l. 1

Calphurnia: When beggars die, there are no comets seen; The heavens
themselves blaze forth the death of princes. Caesar: Cowards die many
times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. Of
all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that
men should fear; Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it
will come.

'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc. 2, l. 30

Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he: We are two
lions littered in one day, And I the elder and more terrible: And Caesar
shall go forth. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc. 2, l. 44

The cause is in my will: I will not come. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 2,
sc. 2, l. 71

See! Antony, that revels long o' nights, Is notwithstanding up. 'Julius
Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc. 2, l. 116

O constancy! be strong upon my side; Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart
and tongue; I have a man's mind, but a woman's might. How hard it is for
women to keep counsel! 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 2, sc. 4, l. 6

Caesar: The ides of March are come. Soothsayer: Ay, Caesar; but not
gone. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l. 1

Be not fond, To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be
thawed from the true quality With that which melted fools; I mean sweet
words, Low-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by
decree is banishéd: If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn
thee like a cur out of my way. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l.
39

If I could pray to move, prayers would move me; But I am constant as the
northern star, Of whose true-fixed and resting quality There is no
fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks,
They are all fire and every one doth shine, But there's but one in all
doth hold his place: So, in the world; 'tis furnished well with men, And
men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive; Yet in the number I do know
but one That unassailable holds on his rank,

Unshaked of motion: and that I am he, Let me a little show it, even in
this, That I was constant Cimber should be banished, And constant do
remain to keep him so. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l. 59

Et tu, Brute? Then fall, Caesar! 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l.
77.

Ambition's debt is paid. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l. 83

That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time And drawing days out, that
men stand upon. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l. 99

He that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing
death. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l. 101

Cassius: How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted o'er,
In states unborn, and accents yet unknown! Brutus: How many times shall
Caesar bleed in sport. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l. 111

O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories,
triumphs, spoils, Shrunk to this little measure? 'Julius Caesar' (1599)
act 3, sc. 1, l. 148

Your swords, made rich With the most noble blood of all this world.
'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l. 155

Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die: No place
will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut
off, The choice and master spirits of this age. 'Julius Caesar' (1599)
act 3, sc. 1, l. 159

Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream
forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of
friendship with thine enemies. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l.
200

The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold
modesty.

'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l. 212

O! pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle
with these butchers; Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever
livéd in the tide of times. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l. 254

Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side, come hot
from hell, Shall in these confines, with a monarch's voice Cry, 'Havoc!'
and let slip the dogs of war; That this foul deed shall smell above the
earth With carrion men, groaning for burial. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act
3, sc. 1, l. 270

Passion, I see, is catching. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 1, l. 283

Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. 'Julius
Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[22\]

As he was valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I slew him.
'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[27\]

Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak; for him have
I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any,
speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love
his country? If any, speak; for him have I offended. I pause for a
reply. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[31\]

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar,
not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them, The good is
oft interréd with their bones; So let it be with Caesar. The noble
Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious; If it were so, it was a
grievous fault; And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under
leave of Brutus and the rest,--- For Brutus is an honourable man; So are
they all, all honourable men,--- Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[79\]

He was my friend, faithful and just to me: But Brutus says he was
ambitious; And Brutus is an honourable man. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act
3, sc. 2, l. \[91\]

When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made
of sterner stuff. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[97\]

On the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown Which he did
thrice refuse: was this ambition? 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2,
l. \[101\]

You all did love him once, not without cause. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act
3, sc. 2, l. \[108\]

O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their
reason. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[110\]

But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world; now
lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. 'Julius Caesar'
(1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[124\]

The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will. 'Julius Caesar' (1599)
act 3, sc. 2, l. \[145\]

You are not wood, you are not stones, but men; And, being men, hearing
the will of Caesar, It will inflame you, it will make you mad. 'Julius
Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[148\]

If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this
mantle: I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on; 'Twas on a
summer's evening, in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. 'Julius
Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[174\]

See what a rent the envious Casca made. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3,
sc. 2, l. \[180\]

This was the most unkindest cut of all; For when the noble Caesar saw
him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms, Quite vanquished
him: then burst his mighty heart; And, in his mantle muffling up his
face, Even at the base of Pompey's statua, Which all the while ran
blood, great Caesar fell. O! what a fall was there, my countrymen; Then
I, and you, and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished
over us.

O! now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity; these are
gracious drops. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[188\]

I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts: I am no orator, as
Brutus is; But, as you know me all, a plain, blunt man, That love my
friend. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[220\]

For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor
power of speech, To stir men's blood; I only speak right on; I tell you
that which you yourselves do know. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2,
l. \[225\]

But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle
up your spirits, and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar, that should
move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act
3, sc. 2, l. \[230\]

He hath left you all his walks, His private arbours, and new-planted
orchards, On this side Tiber; he hath left them you, And to your heirs
for ever; common pleasures, To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[252\]

Here was a Caesar! when comes such another? 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act
3, sc. 2, l. \[257\]

Now let it work; mischief, thou art afoot, Take thou what course thou
wilt! 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[265\]

Fortune is merry, And in this mood will give us anything. 'Julius
Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[271\]

Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses. 'Julius
Caesar' (1599) act 3, sc. 3, l. \[34\]

He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him. 'Julius Caesar' (1599)
act 4, sc. 1, l. 6

This is a slight unmeritable man, Meet to be sent on errands. 'Julius
Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc. 1, l. 12

When love begins to sicken and decay, It useth an enforcéd ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith. 'Julius Caesar' (1599)
act 4, sc. 2, l. 20

Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself Are much condemned to have an
itching palm. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 7

Shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes? 'Julius Caesar'
(1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 23

I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon, Than such a Roman. 'Julius
Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 27

Away, slight man! 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 37

You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus; I said an elder soldier,
not a better: Did I say 'better'? 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc. 3,
l. 55

Do not presume too much upon my love; I may do that I shall be sorry
for. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 63

There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats; For I am armed so strong
in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not.
'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 66

By heaven, I had rather coin my heart, And drop my blood for drachmas,
than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any
indirection. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 72

A friend should bear his friend's infirmities, But Brutus makes mine
greater than they are. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 85

Cassius is aweary of the world; Hated by one he loves; braved by his
brother; Checked like a bondman; all his faults observed, Set in a
note-book, learned, and conned by rote, To cast into my teeth.

'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 94

O Cassius! you are yokéd with a lamb That carries anger as the flint
bears fire; Who, much enforcéd, shows a hasty spark, And straight is
cold again. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 109

O Cassius! I am sick of many griefs. 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc.
3, l. 143

Good reasons must, of force, give place to better. 'Julius Caesar'
(1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 202

The enemy increaseth every day; We, at the height, are ready to decline.
There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the flood, leads
on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in
shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we
must take the current when it serves, Or lose our ventures. 'Julius
Caesar' (1599) act 4, sc. 3, l. 215

This was the noblest Roman of them all; All the conspirators save only
he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar; He, only, in a general

say to all the world, "This was a man!" 'Julius Caesar' (1599) act 5,
sc. 5, l. 68

Grief fills the room up of my absent child, Lies in his bed, walks up

To be possessed with double pomp, To guard a title that was rich before,

None of you will bid the winter come To thrust his icy fingers in my
maw; Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course Through my burned
bosom; nor entreat the north To make his bleak winds kiss my parchéd
lips And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much: I beg cold
comfort; and you are so strait And so ingrateful you deny me that. 'King
John' (1591-8) act 5, sc. 7, l. 36

This England never did, nor never shall, Lie at the proud foot of a
conqueror,

But when it first did help to wound itself. Now these her princes are
come home again, Come the three corners of the world in arms, And we
shall shock them: nought shall make us rue, If England to itself do rest
but true. 'King John' (1591-8) act 5, sc. 7, l. 112

sc. 1, l. \[92\]

Lear: So young, and so untender? Cordelia: So young, my lord, and true.
Lear: Let it be so; thy truth then be thy dower: For, by the sacred
radiance of the sun, The mysteries of Hecate and the night, By all the
operation of the orbs From whom we do exist and cease to be, Here I
disclaim all my paternal care, Propinquity and property of blood, And as
a stranger to my heart and me Hold thee from this for ever. 'King Lear'
(1605-6) act 1, sc. 1, l. \[108\]

I want that glib and oily art To speak and purpose not; since what I
well intend, I'll do't before I speak. 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 1, sc.
1, l. \[227\]

It is no vicious blot nor other foulness, No unchaste action, or
dishonoured step, That hath deprived me of your grace and favour, But
even for want of that for which I am richer, A still-soliciting eye, and
such a tongue That I am glad I have not, though not to have it Hath lost
me in your liking. 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 1, sc. 1, l. \[230\]

Why bastard? wherefore base? When my dimensions are as well compact, My
mind as generous, and my shape as true, As honest madam's issue? Why
brand they us With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base? Who in the
lusty stealth of nature take More composition and fierce quality Than
doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed, Go to creating a whole tribe of
fops, Got 'tween asleep and wake? 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 1, sc. 2, l.
6

I grow, I prosper; Now, gods, stand up for bastards! 'King Lear'
(1605-6) act 1, sc. 2, l. 21

This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in
fortune,---often the surfeit of our own behaviour,---we make guilty of
our own disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were
villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves,
and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and
adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence; and all that
we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion of
whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star!
My father compounded with my mother under the dragon's tail, and my
nativity was under ursa major; so that it follows I am rough and
lecherous. 'Sfoot! I should have been that I am had the maidenliest star
in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. 'King Lear' (1605-6) act
1, sc. 2, l. \[132\]

Kent: Authority. 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 1, sc. 4, l. \[28\]

Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on
her for any thing. 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 1, sc. 4, l. \[40\]

Have more than thou showest, Speak less than thou knowest, Lend less
than thou owest.

'King Lear' (1605-6) act 1, sc. 4, l. \[132\]

Lear: Dost thou call me fool, boy? Fool: All thy other titles thou hast

Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, More hideous, when thou show'st
thee in a child, Than the sea-monster. 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 1, sc.

How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is To have a thankless child!

You see me here, you gods, a poor old man, As full of grief as age;
wretched in both! 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 2, sc. 4, l. \[275\]

Touch me with noble anger, And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags, I will have such revenges
on you both That all the world shall---I will do such things,--- What
they are yet I know not,---but they shall be The terrors of the earth.
You think I'll weep; No, I'll not weep: I have full cause of weeping,
but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws Or ere I'll
weep. O fool! I shall go mad.

Contending with the fretful elements; Bids the wind blow the earth into
the sea, Or swell the curléd waters 'bove the main, That things might
change or cease. 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 3, sc. 1, l. 4

Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow! You cataracts and
hurricanoes, spout Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the
cocks! You sulphurous and thought-executing fires, Vaunt-couriers to
oak-cleaving thunderbolts, Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking
thunder, Strike flat the thick rotundity o' the world! Crack nature's
moulds, all germens spill at once That make ingrateful man! 'King Lear'
(1605-6) act 3, sc. 2, l. 1

Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain! Nor rain, wind, thunder,
fire, are my daughters: I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness; I

infirm, weak, and despised old man. 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 3, sc. 2,

Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill: Halloo, halloo, loo, loo! 'King Lear'

A serving-man, proud in heart and mind: that curled my hair, wore gloves
in my cap, served the lust of my mistress's heart, and did the act of
darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and broke them
in the sweet face of heaven; one that slept in the contriving of lust,
and waked to do it. Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in woman
out-paramoured the Turk. 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 3, sc. 4, l. \[84\]

rank fumitor and furrow weeds, With burdocks, hemlock, nettles,
cuckoo-flowers, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow In our
sustaining corn. 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 4, sc. 4, l. 1

How fearful And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low! The crows and
choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles;
half-way down Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade! Methinks
he seems no bigger than his head. The fishermen that walk upon the beach
Appear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark Diminished to her cock,
her cock a buoy Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge, That on
the unnumbered idle pebbles chafes, Cannot be heard so high. 'King Lear'

Let copulation thrive. 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 4, sc. 6, l. \[110\]

Lear: The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't With a more riotous
appetite. Down from the waist they are Centaurs, Though women all above:
But to the girdle do the Gods inherit, Beneath is all the fiends':
There's hell, there's darkness, there is the sulphurous pit, Burning,
scalding, stench, consumption; fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce
of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination; there's money for

Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand! Why dost thou lash that whore?
Strip thine own back; Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind For

Get thee glass eyes; And, like a scurvy politician, seem To see the

Men must endure Their going hence, even as their coming hither: Ripeness

Come, let's away to prison; We two alone will sing like birds i' the
cage: When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down, And ask of thee
forgiveness: and we'll live, And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and
laugh At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues Talk of court news;
and we'll talk with them too, Who loses, and who wins; who's in, who's
out; And take upon 's the mystery of things, As if we were God's spies;
and we'll wear out, In a walled prison, packs and sets of great ones
That ebb and flow by the moon. 'King Lear' (1605-6) act 5, sc. 3, l. 8

7.66.18 Love's Labour's Lost

Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives, Live registered upon our
brazen tombs, And then grace us in the disgrace of death; When, spite of
cormorant devouring Time, The endeavour of this present breath may buy

That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge, And make us heirs
of all eternity. 'Love's Labour's Lost' (1595) act 1, sc. 1, l. 1

Study is like the heaven's glorious sun, That will not be deep-searched
with saucy looks; Small have continual plodders ever won, Save base
authority from others' books. These earthly godfathers of Heaven's
lights That give a name to every fixéd star, Have no more profit of
their shining nights Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
'Love's Labour's Lost' (1595) act 1, sc. 1, l. 84

At Christmas I no more desire a rose Than wish a snow in May's
new-fangled mirth; But like of each thing that in season grows. 'Love's

This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy, This senior-junior,
giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid; Regent of love rhymes, lord of folded arms, The

A wightly wanton with a velvet brow, With two pitch balls stuck in her

Here are only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy, facility, and
golden cadence of poesy, caret. Ovidius Naso was the man: and why,

From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: They are the ground, the
books, the academes, From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.
'Love's Labour's Lost' (1595) act 4, sc. 3, l. \[302\]

But love, first learnéd in a lady's eyes, Lives not alone immuréd in the
brain, But, with the motion of all elements, Courses as swift as thought
in every power, And gives to every power a double power, Above their
functions and their offices. It adds a precious seeing to the eye; A
lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind; A lover's ears will hear the
lowest sound, When the suspicious head of theft is stopped: Love's
feeling is more soft and sensible Than are the tender horns of cockled
snails: Love's tongue proves dainty Baccus gross in taste. For valour,
is not love a Hercules,

Still climbing trees in the Hesperides? Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and
musical As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair; And when Love
speaks, the voice of all the gods Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
Never durst poet touch a pen to write Until his ink were tempered with
Love's sighs. 'Love's Labour's Lost' (1595) act 4, sc. 3, l. \[327\]

From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: They sparkle still the right

When daisies pied and violets blue And lady-smocks all silver-white And

When icicles hang by the wall, And Dick the shepherd, blows his nail,
And Tom bears logs into the hall, And milk comes frozen home in pail,
When blood is nipped and ways be foul, Then nightly sings the staring
owl, Tu-who; Tu-whit, tu-who---a merry note, While greasy Joan doth keel
the pot. When all aloud the wind doth blow, And coughing drowns the
parson's saw; And birds sit brooding in the snow, And Marion's nose
looks red and raw, When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl. 'Love's Labour's

Where the place? Second Witch: Upon the heath.

What bloody man is that? 'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 2, l. 1

Brave Macbeth,---well he deserves that name,--- Disdaining fortune, with
his brandished steel, Which smoked with bloody execution, Like valour's
minion carved out his passage Till he faced the slave; Which ne'er shook
hands, nor bade farewell to him, Till he unseamed him from the nave to
the chaps, And fixed his head upon our battlements. 'Macbeth' (1606) act

A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap, And munched, and munched, and

I'll thither sail, And, like a rat without a tail, I'll do, I'll do, and

'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 3, l. 30

So foul and fair a day I have not seen. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 3,

What are these, So withered, and so wild in their attire, That look not
like th' inhabitants o' the earth, And yet are on 't? Live you? or are
you aught That man may question? You seem to understand me, By each at
once her choppy finger laying Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,

Two truths are told, As happy prologues to the swelling act Of the
imperial theme. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 3, l. 127

This supernatural soliciting Cannot be ill, cannot be good; if ill, Why
hath it given me earnest of success, Commencing in a truth? I am Thane
of Cawdor: If good, why do I yield to that suggestion Whose horrid image
doth unfix my hair And make my seated heart knock at my ribs, Against
the use of nature? Present fears Are less than horrible imaginings; My
thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical, Shakes so my single state
of man that function Is smothered in surmise, and nothing is But what is
not. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 3, l. 130

Come what come may, Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

Malcolm: Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it: he died As
one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing
he owed As 'twere a careless trifle. Duncan: There's no art To find the
mind's construction in the face; He was a gentleman on whom I built

An absolute trust. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 4, l. 7

Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be What thou art promised. Yet I
do fear thy nature; It is too full o' the milk of human kindness To
catch the nearest way; thou wouldst be great, Art not without ambition;
but without The illness should attend it; what thou wouldst highly, That
thou wouldst holily; wouldst not play false, And yet wouldst wrongly
win; thou'dst have, great Glamis, That which cries, 'Thus thou must do,
if thou have it'; And that which rather thou dost fear to do Than
wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither That I may pour my spirits in
thine ear, And chastise with the valour of my tongue All that impedes
thee from the golden round, Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem To
have thee crowned withal. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 5, l. \[16\]

The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts!
unsex me here, And fill me from the crown to the toe top full Of direst
cruelty; make thick my blood, Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose, nor keep
peace between The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts, And take my
milk for gall, you murdering ministers, Wherever in your sightless
substances You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night, And pall
thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, That my keen knife see not the wound
it makes, Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark, To cry 'Hold,
hold!' 'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 5, l. \[38\]

Your face, my thane, is as a book where men May read strange matters. To

Duncan: This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air Nimbly and sweetly
recommends itself Unto our gentle senses. Banquo: This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve By his loved mansionry that
the heaven's breath Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze, Buttress,
nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendent bed and
procreant cradle: Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, The
air is delicate. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 6, l. 1

If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well It were done quickly:
if the assassination Could trammel up the consequence, and catch With
his surcease success; that but this blow Might be the be-all and the
end-all here, But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, We'd jump the
life to come. But in these cases We still have judgment here; that we
but teach Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return, To plague
the inventor; this even-handed justice Commends the ingredients of our
poisoned chalice To our own lips. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 7, l. 1

Besides, this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been So
clear in his great office, that his virtues Will plead like angels
trumpet-tongued, against The deep damnation of his taking-off; And pity,
like a naked new-born babe, Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim,
horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air, Shall blow the horrid
deed in every eye, That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur To
prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition, which
o'erleaps itself,

And falls on the other. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 7, l. 16

We will proceed no further in this business: He hath honoured me of

'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 7, l. 31

Was the hope drunk, Wherein you dressed yourself? hath it slept since,
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale At what it did so freely?
From this time Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard To be the same
in thine own act and valour As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have
that Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life, And live a coward in
thine own esteem, Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,' Like the
poor cat i' the adage? 'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 7, l. 35

I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none.
'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 7, l. 46

Lady Macbeth: I have given suck, and know How tender 'tis to love the
babe that milks me: I would, while it was smiling in my face, Have
plucked my nipple from his boneless gums, And dash'd the brains out, had
I so sworn as you Have done to this. Macbeth: If we should fail,--- Lady
Macbeth: We fail! But screw your courage to the sticking-place, And
we'll not fail. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 1, sc. 7, l. 54

A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, And yet I would not sleep.
'Macbeth' (1606) act 2, sc. 1, l. 6

Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand? Come,
let me clutch thee: I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Art thou
not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling as to sight? or art thou but A
dagger of the mind, a false creation, Proceeding from the heat-oppressed
brain? 'Macbeth' (1606) act 2, sc. 1, l. 33

Now o'er the one half-world Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
The curtained sleep; witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate's offerings; and
withered murder, Alarumed by his sentinel, the wolf, Whose howl's his
watch, thus with his stealthy pace, With Tarquin's ravishing strides,
toward his design Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth, Hear
not my steps, which way they walk, for fear The very stones prate of my
whereabout, And take the present horror from the time, Which now suits
with it. Whiles I threat he lives: Words to the heat of deeds too cold
breath gives. I go, and it is done; the bell invites me. Hear it not,
Duncan; for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
'Macbeth' (1606) act 2, sc. 1, l. 49

That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold, What hath quenched

Wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'? I had most need of blessing, and
'Amen' Stuck in my throat. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 2, sc. 2, l. 32

Methought I heard a voice cry, 'Sleep no more! Macbeth does murder
sleep,' the innocent sleep, Sleep that knits up the ravelled sleave of
care, The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath, Balm of hurt
minds, great nature's second course, Chief nourisher in life's feast.
'Macbeth' (1606) act 2, sc. 2, l. 36

Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more,

Macbeth: I am afraid to think what I have done; Look on't again I dare
not. Lady Macbeth: Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The sleeping

painted devil. If he do bleed I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
For it must seem their guilt. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 2, sc. 2, l. 52

Here's a knocking, indeed! If a man were porter of hell-gate he should

Who's there i' the other devil's name! Faith, here's an equivocator,

Porter: Drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things. Macduff: What

The night has been unruly: where we lay Our chimneys were blown down;

Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had lived a blessed time;

Lady Macbeth: Things without all remedy Should be without regard: what's
done is done. Macbeth: We have scotched the snake, not killed it: She'll
close and be herself, whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her
former tooth. But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds
suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep In the affliction of
these terrible dreams That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of
the mind to lie In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave; After
life's fitful fever he sleeps well; Treason has done his worst: nor
steel, nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing, Can touch him
further. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 3, sc. 2, l. 11

Ere the bat hath flown His cloistered flight, ere, to black Hecate's
summons The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night's
yawning peal, there shall be done A deed of dreadful note. 'Macbeth'
(1606) act 3, sc. 2, l. 40

Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed.
Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, And with
thy bloody and invisible hand, Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow Makes wing to the
rooky wood; Good things of day begin to droop and drowse, Whiles night's
black agents to their preys do rouse. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 3, sc. 2, l.

The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day: Now spurs the lated
traveller apace

To gain the timely inn. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 3, sc. 3, l. 5

Ourself will mingle with society And play the humble host. 'Macbeth'

Thou canst not say I did it: never shake Thy gory locks at me. 'Macbeth'

What man dare, I dare; Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, The
armed rhinoceros or the Hyrcan tiger, Take any shape but that, and my
firm nerves Shall never tremble. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 3, sc. 4, l. 99

Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once. 'Macbeth' (1606)
act 3, sc. 4, l. 119

Macbeth: It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood: Stones
have been known to move and trees to speak; Augurs and understood
relations have By maggot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth The
secret'st man of blood. What is the night? Lady Macbeth: Almost at odds
with morning, which is which. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 3, sc. 4, l. 122

I am in blood Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning

Round about the cauldron go;

nights hast thirty-one Sweltered venom sleeping got, Boil thou first i'
the charméd pot. Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron
bubble. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 4, sc. 1, l. 4

Eye of newt, and toe of frog, Wool of bat, and tongue of dog, Adder's
fork, and blind-worm's sting, Lizard's leg, and howlet's wing, For a
charm of powerful trouble, Like a hell-broth boil and bubble. 'Macbeth'
(1606) act 4, sc. 1, l. 14

Liver of blaspheming Jew, Gall of goat, and slips of yew Slivered in the
moon's eclipse, Nose of Turk, and Tartar's lips, Finger of

Second Witch: By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way

He loves us not; He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren, The most

Son: And must they all be hanged that swear and lie? Lady Macduff: Every

What! man; ne'er pull your hat upon your brows; Give sorrow words: the
grief that does not speak Whispers the o'er-fraught heart, and bids it
break. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 4, sc. 3, l. 208

Malcolm: Let's make us medicine of our great revenge, To cure this
deadly grief. Macduff: He has no children. All my pretty ones? Did you

At one fell swoop? 'Macbeth' (1606) act 4, sc. 3, l. 216

Hell is murky! Fie, my

The Thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now? What! will these hands

Here's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not

Those he commands move only in command, Nothing in love; now does he

Bring me no more reports; let them fly all: Till Birnam wood remove to

The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon! Where gott'st thou
that goose look? 'Macbeth' (1606) act 5, sc. 3, l. 11

I have livéd long enough: my way of life Is fall'n into the sear, the
yellow leaf; And that which should accompany old age, As honour, love,
obedience, troops of friends, I must not look to have; but, in their
stead, Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,

Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. 'Macbeth' (1606) act
5, sc. 3, l. 22

Macbeth: Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased, Pluck from the
memory a rooted sorrow, Raze out the written troubles of the brain, And
with some sweet oblivious antidote Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that
perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart? Doctor: Therein the patient
Must minister to himself. Macbeth: Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none

Hang out our banners on the outward walls; The cry is still, 'They
come'; our castle's strength Will laugh a siege to scorn. 'Macbeth'

I have almost forgot the taste of fears. The time has been my senses
would have cooled To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair Would at a
dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in't. I have supped full
with horrors; Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts, Cannot
once start me. 'Macbeth' (1606) act 5, sc. 5, l. 9

She should have died hereafter; There would have been a time for such a
word, To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace
from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our
yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief
candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, That struts and
frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more; it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing. 'Macbeth'
(1606) act 5, sc. 5, l. 16

If that which he avouches does appear, There is nor flying hence, nor
tarrying here. I 'gin to be aweary of the sun,

Blow, wind! come, wrack! At least we'll die with harness on our back.
'Macbeth' (1606) act 5, sc. 5, l. 47

Macbeth: I bear a charméd life, which must not yield To one of woman
born. Macduff: Despair thy charm; And let the angel who thou still hast

Lay on, Macduff; And damned be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'

7.66.20 Measure for Measure

Now, as fond fathers, Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight For terror, not to use, in
time the rod Becomes more mocked than feared; so our decrees, Dead to
infliction, to themselves are dead, And liberty plucks justice by the
nose; The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart Goes all decorum.
'Measure for Measure' (1604) act 1, sc. 3, l. 23

I hold you as a thing enskyed and sainted; By your renouncement an
immortal spirit, And to be talked with in sincerity, As with a saint.

O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint, With saints dost bait thy hook!
Most dangerous Is that temptation that doth goad us on To sin in loving

Ever till now When men were fond, I smiled and wondered how. 'Measure

Claudio: The miserable have no other medicine But only hope: I have hope

death or life Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life: If I
do lose thee, I do lose a thing That none but fools would keep: a breath
thou art Servile to all the skyey influences, That dost this habitation,
where thou keep'st, Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art death's fool; For
him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun,

And yet run'st toward him still. 'Measure for Measure' (1604) act 3, sc.

If thou art rich, thou'rt poor; For, like an ass whose back with ingots

Thou hast nor youth nor age; But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth Becomes as aged, and doth

Dar'st thou die? The sense of death is most in apprehension, And the

Claudio: Death is a fearful thing. Isabella: And shamed life a hateful.
Claudio: Ay, but to die, and go we know not where; To lie in cold
obstruction and to rot; This sensible warm motion to become A kneaded
clod; and the delighted spirit To bathe in fiery floods or to reside In
thrilling region of thick-ribbéd ice; To be imprisoned in the viewless
winds, And blown with restless violence round about The pendant world;
or to be worse than worst Of those that lawless and incertain thoughts
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible! The weariest and most loathéd
worldly life

7.66.21 The Merchant of Venice

Antonio: In sooth I know not why I am so sad: It wearies me; you say it
wearies you; But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, What stuff
'tis made of, whereof it is born, I am to learn; And such a want-wit
sadness makes of me, That I have much ado to know myself. Salarino: Your
mind is tossing on the ocean; There, where your argosies with portly
sail,--- Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, Or, as it were,
the pageants of the sea,--- Do overpeer the petty traffickers, That
curtsy to them, do them reverence, As they fly by them with their woven
wings. 'The Merchant of Venice' (1596-8) act 1, sc. 1, l. 1

I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano; A stage where every man

Why should a man, whose blood is warm within, Sit like his grandsire cut

There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a

With purpose to be dressed in an opinion Of wisdom, gravity, profound

no dog bark!' O, my Antonio, I do know of these, That therefore only are
reputed wise, For saying nothing. 'The Merchant of Venice' (1596-8) act

Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all

If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been

sc. 3, l. \[36\]

How like a fawning publican he looks! I hate him for he is a Christian;
But more for that in low simplicity He lends out money gratis, and
brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice. If I can catch
him once upon the hip, I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him. He
hates our sacred nation, and he rails, Even there where merchants most
do congregate, On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift, Which he
calls interest. 'The Merchant of Venice' (1596-8) act 1, sc. 3, l.

About my moneys and my usances: Still have I borne it with a patient
shrug, For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe. You call me
misbeliever, cut-throat dog,

And spet upon my Jewish gabardine, And all for use of that which is mine
own. 'The Merchant of Venice' (1596-8) act 1, sc. 3, l. \[107\]

You that did void your rheum upon my beard, And foot me as you spurn a
stranger cur Over your threshold: moneys is your suit. What should I say
to you? Should I not say, 'Hath a dog money? Is it possible A cur can
lend three thousand ducats?' or Shall I bend low, and in a bondman's
key, With bated breath, and whispering humbleness, Say this:--- 'Fair
sir, you spat on me Wednesday last; You spurned me such a day; another
time You called me dog; and for these courtesies I'll lend you thus much
moneys?' 'The Merchant of Venice' (1596-8) act 1, sc. 3, l. \[118\]

O father Abram! what these Christians are, Whose own hard dealing

aNtonio: This Hebrew will turn Christian, he grows kind. Bassanio: I

Mislike me not for my complexion, The shadowed livery of the burnished
sun, To whom I am a neighbour and near bred. 'The Merchant of Venice'
(1596-8) act 2, sc. 1, l. 1

My conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to
me, 'my honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man's son,'---or rather
an honest woman's son;---for, indeed, my father did something smack,
something grow to, he had a kind of taste;---well, my conscience says,
'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge.' says the fiend. 'Budge not,' says my
conscience. 'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' 'fiend,' say I,
'you counsel well.' 'The Merchant of Venice' (1596-8) act 2, sc. 2, l.

Black-Monday. 'The Merchant of Venice' (1596-8) act 2, sc. 5, l. \[24\]

Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum, And the vile squealing of
the wry-necked fife, Clamber not you up to the casements then, Nor
thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with
varnished faces, But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements; Let not
the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house. 'The Merchant of
Venice' (1596-8) act 2, sc. 5, l. \[29\]

Love is blind, and lovers cannot see The pretty follies that themselves

Christian ducats! Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter! 'The

What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant By the fool multitude,
that choose by show, Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
Which pries not to the interior; but, like the martlet, Builds in the
weather on the outward wall, Even in the force and road of casualty. I
will not choose what many men desire, Because I will not jump with
common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitude.

The fire seven times tried this: Seven times tried that judgment is That

Thus hath the candle singed the moth. O, these deliberate fools! 'The

The Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very dangerous flat, and

Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses,
affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same
weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed
and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you
prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you
poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If
we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. 'The Merchant

Tubal: One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a

Tell me where is fancy bred. Or in the heart or in the head? How begot,
how nourishéd? Reply, reply. It is engendered in the eyes, With gazing

In the cradle where it lies. Let us all ring fancy's knell: I'll begin
it,---Ding, dong, bell. 'The Merchant of Venice' (1596-8) act 3, sc. 2,
l. 63

So may the outward shows be least themselves: The world is still
deceived with ornament. In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt But,
being seasoned with a gracious voice, Obscures the show of evil? In
religion, What damnéd error, but some sober brow Will bless it and
approve it with a text, Hiding the grossness with fair ornament? There
is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward
parts. 'The Merchant of Venice' (1596-8) act 3, sc. 2, l. 73

Ornament is but the guiléd shore To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous
scarf Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word, The seeming truth which
cunning times put on To entrap the wisest. 'The Merchant of Venice'
(1596-8) act 3, sc. 2, l. 97

You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand, Such as I am: though for
myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish, To wish myself much
better; yet, for you I would be trebled twenty times myself; A thousand
times more fair, ten thousand times More rich; That only to stand high
in your account, I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends, Exceed
account: but the full sum of me Is sum of nothing; which, to term in
gross, Is an unlessoned girl, unschooled, unpractised; Happy in this,
she is not yet so old But she may learn; happier than this, She is not
bred so dull but she can learn. 'The Merchant of Venice' (1596-8) act 3,

You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh

Some men there are love not a gaping pig; Some, that are mad if they

There is no firm reason to be rendered, Why he cannot abide a gaping

Portia: Then must the Jew be merciful. Shylock: On what compulsion must
I? tell me that. Portia: The quality of mercy is not strained, It
droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath: it is
twice blessed; It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:

'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes The thronéd monarch better
than his crown; His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, The
attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of
kings; But mercy is above this sceptred sway, It is enthronéd in the
hearts of kings, It is an attribute to God himself, And earthly power
doth then show likest God's When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this, That in the course of justice
none of us Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy, And that same
prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy. 'The Merchant of
Venice' (1596-8) act 4, sc. 1, l. \[182\]

My deeds upon my head! I crave the law. 'The Merchant of Venice'

The moon shines bright: in such a night as this, When the sweet wind did
gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise, in such a night
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls, And sighed his soul toward
the Grecian tents, Where Cressid lay that night. 'The Merchant of
Venice' (1596-8) act 5, sc. 1, l. 1

In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild
sea-banks, and waft her love To come again to Carthage. 'The Merchant of

How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! Here will we sit, and let
the sounds of music Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony. Sit, Jessica: look, how the floor
of heaven Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold: There's not the
smallest orb which thou behold'st But in this motion like an angel sings
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;

Such harmony is in immortal souls; But, whilst this muddy vesture of
decay Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it. 'The Merchant of
Venice' (1596-8) act 5, sc. 1, l. 54

I am never merry when I hear sweet music. 'The Merchant of Venice'
(1596-8) act 5, sc. 1, l. 69

The man that hath no music in himself, Nor is not moved with concord of
sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils; The motions
of his spirit are dull as night, And his affections dark as Erebus: Let
no such man be trusted. 'The Merchant of Venice' (1596-8) act 5, sc. 1,
l. 79

Portia: How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good
deed in a naughty world. Nerissa: When the moon shone, we did not see
the candle. Portia: So doth the greater glory dim the less: A substitute
shines brightly as a king Until a king be by, and then his state Empties
itself, as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters. 'The Merchant
of Venice' (1596-8) act 5, sc. 1, l. 90

The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended, and
I think The nightingale, if she should sing by day, When every goose is
cackling, would be thought No better a musician than the wren. How many
things by season seasoned are To their right praise and true perfection!
Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion, And would not be awaked! 'The
Merchant of Venice' (1596-8) act 5, sc. 1, l. 102

He so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails against all married

7.66.23 A Midsummer Night's Dream

Question your desires; Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice, You can endure the
livery of a nun, For aye to be in shady cloister mewed, To live a barren
sister all your life, Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice blesséd they that master so their blood, To undergo such maiden
pilgrimage; But earthlier happy is the rose distilled, Than that which
withering on the virgin thorn Grows, lives, and dies, in single
blessedness. 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' (1595-6) act 1, sc. 1, l. 67

Ay me! for aught that ever I could read, Could ever hear by tale or

O hell! to choose love by another's eye. 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'
(1595-6) act 1, sc. 1, l. 140

If there were a sympathy in choice, War, death, or sickness did lay
siege to it, Making it momentany as a sound, Swift as a shadow, short as
any dream, Brief as the lightning in the collied night, That, in a
spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth, And ere a man hath power to say,
'Behold!' The jaws of darkness do devour it up: So quick bright things
come to confusion. 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' (1595-6) act 1, sc. 1, l.
141

Your eyes are lodestars! and your tongue's sweet air More tuneable than
lark to shepherd's ear, When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
'A Midsummer Night's Dream' (1595-6) act 1, sc. 1, l. 183

How happy some o'er other some can be! Through Athens I am thought as
fair as she; But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so; He will not know
what all but he do know; And as he errs, doting on Helen's eyes, So I,
admiring of his qualities.

Things base and vile, holding no quantity, Love can transpose to form
and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, And
therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind. 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'

Puck: How now, spirit! whither wander you? Fairy: Over hill, over dale,
Thorough bush, thorough brier, Over park, over pale, Thorough flood,
thorough fire, I do wander everywhere, Swifter than the moone's sphere;
And I serve the fairy queen, To dew her orbs upon the green: The
cowslips tall her pensioners be; In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favours, In those freckles live their savours: I
must go seek some dew-drops here,

And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'

The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale, Sometime for three-foot stool
mistaketh me; Then slip I from her bum, down topples she, And 'tailor'

Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'

The fold stands empty in the drownéd field, And crows are fatted with
the murrion flock; The nine men's morris is filled up with mud. 'A
Midsummer Night's Dream' (1595-6) act 2, sc. 1, l. 96

Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes
all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound: And thorough this
distemperature we see The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts Fall in the
fresh lap of the crimson rose. 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' (1595-6) act
2, sc. 1, l. 103

Since once I sat upon a promontory, And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's
back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath, That the rude sea grew
civil at her song, And certain stars shot madly from their spheres, To
hear the sea-maid's music. 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' (1595-6) act 2,
sc. 1, l. 149

But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft Quenched in the chaste beams
of the wat'ry moon, And the imperial votaress passed on, In maiden
meditation, fancy-free. Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell: It
fell upon a little western flower, Before milk-white, now purple with
love's wound, And maidens call it, Love-in-idleness. 'A Midsummer
Night's Dream' (1595-6) act 2, sc. 1, l. 161

I'll put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes. 'A Midsummer

I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows, Where oxlips and the nodding
violet grows Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet
musk-roses, and with eglantine: There sleeps Titania some time of the
night, Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight; And there the
snake throws her enamelled skin, Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in. 'A
Midsummer Night's Dream' (1595-6) act 2, sc. 1, l. 249

You spotted snakes with double tongue, Thorny hedge-hogs, be not seen;
Newts, and blind-worms, do no wrong; Come not near our fairy queen. 'A

Othello: Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, My very noble and
approved good masters, That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
It is most true; true, I have married her:

The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent, no more. Rude
am I in my speech, And little blessed with the soft phrase of peace; For
since these arms of mine had seven years' pith, Till now some nine moons
wasted, they have used Their dearest action in the tented field; And
little of this great world can I speak, More than pertains to feats of
broil and battle; And therefore little shall I grace my cause In
speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience, I will a round
unvarnished tale deliver Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what
charms, What conjuration, and what mighty magic, For such proceeding I
am charged withal, I won his daughter. Brabantio: A maiden never bold;

life From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes That I have
passed. I ran it through, even from my boyish days To the very moment

moving accidents by flood and field, Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the
imminent deadly breach, Of being taken by the insolent foe And sold to
slavery, of my redemption thence And portance in my travel's history;
Wherein of antres vast and desarts idle, Rough quarries, rocks and hills
whose heads touch heaven, It was my hint to speak, such was the process;
And of the Cannibals that each other eat, The Anthropophagi, and men
whose heads Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear Would
Desdemona seriously incline. 'Othello' (1602-4) act 1, sc. 3, l. 128

And often did beguile her of her tears,

When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth suffered. My
story being done, She gave me for my pains a world of sighs: She swore,
in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange; 'Twas pitiful, 'twas
wondrous pitiful: She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished That
heaven had made her such a man; she thanked me, And bade me, if I had a
friend that lov'd her, I should but teach him how to tell my story, And
that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake: She loved me for the dangers
I had passed, And I loved her that she did pity them. This only is the
witchcraft I have used. 'Othello' (1602-4) act 1, sc. 3, l. 156

A slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasions, that has an eye
can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
present itself; a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young,
and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look
after; a pestilent complete knave! and the woman hath found him already.

Too hideous to be shown. 'Othello' (1602-4) act 3, sc. 3, l. 106

Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of
their souls; Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands; But he that
filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him, And
makes me poor indeed. 'Othello' (1602-4) act 3, sc. 3, l. 155

If I do prove her haggard, Though that her jesses were my dear
heart-strings, I'd whistle her off and let her down the wind, To prey at
fortune. Haply, for I am black, And have not those soft parts of
conversation That chamberers have, or, for I am declined Into the vale
of years---yet that's not much--- She's gone, I am abused; and my relief
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage! That we can call these
delicate creatures ours, And not their appetites. I had rather be a
toad, And live upon the vapour of a dungeon, Than keep a corner in the
thing I love For others' uses. 'Othello' (1602-4) act 3, sc. 3, l. 260

wars That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!

Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump, The spirit-stirring
drum, the ear-piercing fife, The royal banner, and all quality, Pride,
pomp, and circumstance of glorious war! And, O you mortal engines, whose
rude throats The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit, Farewell!
Othello's occupation's gone! 'Othello' (1602-4) act 3, sc. 3, l. 346

Had it pleased heaven To try me with affliction, had he rained

All kinds of sores, and shames, on my bare head, Steeped me in poverty
to the very lips, Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes, I should
have found in some part of my soul A drop of patience; but, alas! to
make me The fixéd figure for the time of scorn To point his slow and
moving finger at; Yet could I bear that too; well, very well. But there,
where I have garnered up my heart, Where either I must live or bear no
life, The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up; to
be discarded thence! Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and
gender in! Turn thy complexion there, Patience, thou young and
rose-lipped cherubin; Ay, there, look grim as hell! 'Othello' (1602-4)

My mother had a maid called Barbara; She was in love, and he she loved
proved mad And did forsake her; she had a song of 'willow;' An old thing

The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree, Sing all a green willow;
Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee, Sing willow, willow,

stones;--- Sing willow, willow, willow: Sing all a green willow must be
my garland. 'Othello' (1602-4) act 4, sc. 3, l. \[41\].

It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul; Let me not name it to you,
you chaste stars! It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood,

Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow, And smooth as monumental
alabaster. Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men. Put out the
light, and then put out the light: If I quench thee, thou flaming
minister, I can again thy former light restore, Should I repent me; but
once put out thy light, Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature, I
know not where is that Promethean heat That can thy light relume. When I
have plucked the rose, I cannot give it vital growth again, It needs
must wither: I'll smell it on the tree. O balmy breath, that dost almost
persuade Justice to break her sword! One more, one more. Be thus when
thou art dead, and I will kill thee, And love thee after. One more, and
this the last: So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep, But they are
cruel tears; this sorrow's heavenly, It strikes where it doth love.

O ill-starred wench! Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven, And fiends will snatch

slave. Whip me, ye devils, From the possession of this heavenly sight!
Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur! Wash me in steep-down gulfs
of liquid fire! O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead! 'Othello' (1602-4) act 5,

I have done the state some service, and they know 't; No more of that. I
pray you, in your letters, When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice:
then, must you speak Of one that loved not wisely but too well; Of one
not easily jealous, but, being wrought, Perplexed in the extreme; of one
whose hand, Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away Richer than all his
tribe; of one whose subdued eyes Albeit unuséd to the melting mood, Drop
tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their med'cinable gum. Set you down
this; And say besides, that in Aleppo once, Where a malignant and a
turbaned Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, I took by the
throat the circumcised dog, And smote him thus. 'Othello' (1602-4) act

The purest treasure mortal times afford Is spotless reputation; that
away, Men are but gilded loam or painted clay. A jewel in a
ten-times-barred-up chest Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast. Mine
honour is my life; both grow in one; Take honour from me, and my life is
done. 'Richard II' (1595) act 1, sc. 1, l. 177

We were not born to sue, but to command. 'Richard II' (1595) act 1, sc.

All places that the eye of heaven visits Are to a wise man ports and
happy havens. Teach thy necessity to reason thus; There is no virtue

O! who can hold a fire in his hand By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite, By bare imagination of a feast? Or

good Gives but the greater feeling to the worse. 'Richard II' (1595) act
1, sc. 3, l. 294

More are men's ends marked than their lives before: The setting sun, and
music at the close, As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last, Writ
in remembrance more than things long past. 'Richard II' (1595) act 2,
sc. 1, l. 11

Methinks I am a prophet new inspired, And thus expiring do foretell of
him: His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last, For violent fires soon
burn out themselves; Small showers last long, but sudden storms are
short; He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes. 'Richard II' (1595)
act 2, sc. 1, l. 31

This royal throne of kings, this sceptered isle, This earth of majesty,
this seat of Mars, This other Eden, demi-paradise, This fortress built
by Nature for herself Against infection and the hand of war, This happy
breed of men, this little world, This precious stone set in the silver
sea, Which serves it in the office of a wall, Or as a moat defensive to
a house, Against the envy of less happier lands, This blesséd plot, this
earth, this realm, this England, This nurse, this teeming womb of royal
kings, Feared by their breed and famous by their birth, Renownéd for
their deeds as far from home,--- For Christian service and true
chivalry,--- As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry Of the world's
ransom, blesséd Mary's Son: This land of such dear souls, this dear,
dear land, Dear for her reputation through the world, Is now leased
out,---I die pronouncing it,--- Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
England, bound in with the triumphant sea, Whose rocky shore beats back
the envious siege Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,

With inky blots, and rotten parchment bonds: That England, that was wont
to conquer others, Hath made a shameful conquest of itself. 'Richard II'

Eating the bitter bread of banishment. 'Richard II' (1595) act 3, sc. 1,
l. 21

Not all the water in the rough rude sea Can wash the balm from an
anointed king; The breath of worldly men cannot depose The deputy
elected by the Lord. For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressedd To
lift shrewd steel against our golden crown, God for his Richard hath in
heavenly pay A glorious angel; then, if angels fight, Weak men must
fall, for heaven still guards the right. 'Richard II' (1595) act 3, sc.

The worst is death, and death will have his day. 'Richard II' (1595) act
3, sc. 2, l. 103

Of comfort no man speak: Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes

Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth. Let's choose executors, and talk
of wills. 'Richard II' (1595) act 3, sc. 2, l. 144

For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground And tell sad stories of the
death of kings: How some have been deposed, some slain in war, Some
haunted by the ghosts they have deposed, Some poisoned by their wives,
some sleeping killed; All murdered: for within the hollow crown That
rounds the mortal temples of a king Keeps Death his court, and there the
antick sits, Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp; Allowing him a
breath, a little scene, To monarchize, be feared, and kill with looks,
Infusing him with self and vain conceit As if this flesh which walls
about our life Were brass impregnable; and humoured thus Comes at the
last, and with a little pin Bores through his castle wall, and farewell
king! 'Richard II' (1595) act 3, sc. 2, l. 155

See, see, King Richard doth himself appear, As doth the blushing
discontented sun From out the fiery portal of the east. 'Richard II'

O! that I were as great As is my grief, or lesser than my name, Or that
I could forget what I have been, Or not remember what I must be now.
'Richard II' (1595) act 3, sc. 3, l. 136

What must the king do now? Must he submit? The king shall do it: must he
be deposed? The king shall be contented: must he lose The name of king?
o' God's name, let it go. I'll give my jewels for a set of beads, My
gorgeous palace for a hermitage, My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
My figured goblets for a dish of wood, My sceptre for a palmer's walking
staff,

My subjects for a pair of carved saints, And my large kingdom for a
little grave, A little little grave, an obscure grave; Or I'll be buried
in the king's highway, Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
May hourly trample on their sovereign's head; For on my heart they tread
now whilst I live; And buried once, why not upon my head? 'Richard II'
(1595) act 3, sc. 3, l. 143

Shall we play the wantons with our woes, And make some pretty match with

Here did she fall a tear; here, in this place, I'll set a bank of rue,
sour herb of grace; Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen, In
the remembrance of a weeping queen. 'Richard II' (1595) act 3, sc. 4, l.
104

Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels, And in this seat of peace
tumultuous wars Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny Shall here inhabit, and this land be
called The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls. 'Richard II' (1595)

Well then, amen. 'Richard II' (1595) act 4, sc. 1, l. 172

Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown; Here cousin, On this
side my hand and on that side thine. Now is this golden crown like a
deep well That owes two buckets filling one another; The emptier ever
dancing in the air, The other down, unseen, and full of water:

That bucket down and full of tears am I, Drinking my griefs, whilst you
mount up on high. 'Richard II' (1595) act 4, sc. 1, l. 181

You may my glories and my state depose, But not my griefs; still am I
king of those. 'Richard II' (1595) act 4, sc. 1, l. 192

Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see: And yet salt water blinds
them not so much But they can see a sort of traitors here. Nay, if I
turn my eyes upon myself, I find myself a traitor with the rest.

In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire With good old folks, and let
them tell thee tales Of woeful ages, long ago betid; And ere thou bid
good night, to quit their grief, Tell thou the lamentable tale of me,
And send the hearers weeping to their beds. 'Richard II' (1595) act 5,
sc. 1, l. 40

That were some love but little policy. 'Richard II' (1595) act 5, sc. 1,
l. 84

As in a theatre, the eyes of men,

After a well-graced actor leaves the stage, Are idly bent on him that
enters next, Thinking his prattle to be tedious; Even so, or with much
more contempt, men's eyes Did scowl on Richard. 'Richard II' (1595) act
5, sc. 2, l. 23

7.66.28 Richard III

Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of
York. 'Richard III' (1591) act 1, sc. 1, l. 1

Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front; And now, instead of
mounting barbéd steeds, To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,---
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a
lute. But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, Nor made to court
an amorous looking-glass; I, that am rudely stamped, and want love's
majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; I, that am curtailed of
this fair proportion, Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time

Into this breathing world, scarce half made up, And that so lamely and
unfashionable That dogs bark at me, as I halt by them; Why, I, in this
weak piping time of peace, Have no delight to pass away the time.
'Richard III' (1591) act 1, sc. 1, l. 9

And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover, To entertain these fair
well-spoken days, I am determinéd to prove a villain, And hate the idle
pleasures of these days. 'Richard III' (1591) act 1, sc. 1, l. 28

Teach not thy lip such scorn, for it was made For kissing, lady, not for
such contempt. 'Richard III' (1591) act 1, sc. 2, l. 172

Was ever woman in this humour wooed? Was ever woman in this humour won?
'Richard III' (1591) act 1, sc. 2, l. 229

Cannot a plain man live and think no harm, But that his simple truth
must be abused By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks? 'Richard III' (1591)
act 1, sc. 3, l. 51

Since every Jack became a gentleman There's many a gentle person made a
Jack. 'Richard III' (1591) act 1, sc. 3, l. 72

And thus I clothe my naked villany With odd old ends stol'n forth of
holy writ, And seem a saint when most I play the devil. 'Richard III'
(1591) act 1, sc. 3, l. 336

Lord, Lord! methought what pain it was to drown: What dreadful noise of
water in mine ears! What sights of ugly death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wracks; A thousand men that fishes
gnawed upon; Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, Inestimable
stones, unvalued jewels, All scattered in the bottom of the sea. Some
lay in dead men's skulls; and in those holes Where eyes did once
inhabit, there were crept

As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems, That wooed the slimy bottom
of the deep, And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by. 'Richard
III' (1591) act 1, sc. 4, l. 21

Clarence is come,---false, fleeting, perjured Clarence. 'Richard III'

My Lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn, I saw good strawberries in
your garden there. 'Richard III' (1591) act 3, sc. 4, l. 31

Talk'st thou to me of 'ifs'? Thou art a traitor: Off with his head!
'Richard III' (1591) act 3, sc. 4, l. 74

I am not in the giving vein to-day. 'Richard III' (1591) act 4, sc. 2,
l. 115

The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom. 'Richard III' (1591) act 4,
sc. 3, l. 38

Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell. A grievous burden was
thy birth to me; Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy; Thy school-days
frightful, desperate, wild and furious; Thy prime of manhood daring,
bold, and venturous; Thy age confirmed, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred; What comfortable hour
canst thou name That ever graced me in thy company? 'Richard III' (1591)
act 4, sc. 4, l. 167

An honest tale speeds best being plainly told. 'Richard III' (1591) act

Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream. O coward conscience, how dost
thou afflict me! 'Richard III' (1591) act 5, sc. 3, l. 178

My conscience hath a thousand several tongues, And every tongue brings
in a several tale, And every tale condemns me for a villain. 'Richard
III' (1591) act 5, sc. 3, l. 194

I shall despair. There is no creature loves me; And if I die, no soul
will pity me: Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself Find in
myself no pity to myself? 'Richard III' (1591) act 5, sc. 3, l. 201

By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night Have struck more terror to the
soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers.
'Richard III' (1591) act 5, sc. 3, l. 217

Conscience is but a word that cowards use, Devised at first to keep the
strong in awe. 'Richard III' (1591) act 5, sc. 3, l. 310

A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! 'Richard III' (1591) act 5,
sc. 4, l. 7

Slave! I have set my life upon a cast, And I will stand the hazard of
the die. 'Richard III' (1591) act 5, sc. 4, l. 9

7.66.29 Romeo And Juliet

From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed
lovers take their life. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) prologue

The fearful passage of their death-marked love, And the continuance of
their parents' rage, Which, but their children's end, nought could
remove, Is now the two hours' traffick of our stage. 'Romeo And Juliet'
(1595) prologue

Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 1, sc.
1, l. \[50\]

I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir. 'Romeo And
Juliet' (1595) act 1, sc. 1, l. \[56\]

'Tis not hard, I think, For men so old as we to keep the peace.

'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 1, sc. 2, l. 2

Paris: Younger than she are happy mothers made. Capulet: And too soon
marred are those so early made. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 1, sc. 2,
l. 12

And then my husband---God be with his soul! A' was a merry man---took up
the child: 'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt
fall backward when thou hast more wit; Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my
halidom, The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay'... Pretty fool, it
stinted and said 'Ay.' 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 1, sc. 3, l. 39

O! then, I see, Queen Mab hath been with you... She is the fairies'
midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the
forefinger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Athwart
men's noses as they lie asleep: Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners'
legs; The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; The traces, of the
smallest spider's web; The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams; Her
whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film; Her waggoner, a small
grey-coated gnat, Not half so big as a round little worm Pricked from
the lazy finger of a maid; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut, Made by
the joiner squirrel or old grub, Time out o' mind the fairies'
coach-makers. And in this state she gallops night by night Through
lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er courtiers' knees, that
dream on curtsies straight; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on
fees; O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream; Which oft the
angry Mab with blisters plagues, Because their breaths with sweetmeats
tainted are. Sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, And then
dreams he of smelling out a suit; And sometimes comes she with a
tithe-pig's tail, Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,

Then dreams he of another benefice; Sometimes she driveth o'er a
soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, Of
breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, Of healths five fathom deep; and
then anon Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes; And, being
thus frighted, swears a prayer or two, And sleeps again. This is that
very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night; And bakes the
elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs, Which once untangled much misfortune
bodes; This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them
and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage.
'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 1, sc. 4, l. 53

You and I are past our dancing days. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 1,
sc. 5, l. \[35\]

O! she doth teach the torches to burn bright. It seems she hangs upon
the cheek of night Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear; Beauty too rich
for use, for earth too dear. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 1, sc. 5, l.
\[48\]

Gentlemen, prepare not to be gone; We have a trifling foolish banquet
towards. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 1, sc. 5, l. \[125\]

My only love sprung from my only hate! Too early seen unknown, and known
too late! 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 1, sc. 5, l. \[142\]

He jests at scars, that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light
through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 1

It is my lady; O! it is my love: O! that she knew she were. 'Romeo And
Juliet' (1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 10

See! how she leans her cheek upon her hand: O! that I were a glove upon
that hand, That I might touch that cheek. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act
2, sc. 2, l. 23

O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?

Deny thy father, and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn
my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act
2, sc. 2, l. 33

What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other name would
smell as sweet. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 43

With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits
cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt.
'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 66

Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush
bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. 'Romeo
And Juliet' (1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 85

Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but
farewell compliment! 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 88

At lovers' perjuries, They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo! If thou
dost love, pronounce it faithfully: Or if thou think'st I am too quickly
won, I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo; but
else, not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond. 'Romeo
And Juliet' (1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 92

I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 100

Romeo: Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all
these fruit-tree tops,--- Juliet: O! swear not by the moon, the
inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy
love prove likewise variable. Romeo: What shall I swear by? Juliet: Do
not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is
the god of my idolatry. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 107

It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;

Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say it
lightens. Sweet, good-night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening
breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. 'Romeo And
Juliet' (1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 118

My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep; the more I give
to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite. 'Romeo And Juliet'
(1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 133

Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books; But love from
love, toward school with heavy looks. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 2,
sc. 2, l. 156

Juliet: O! for a falconer's voice, To lure this tassel-gentle back
again. Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud, Else would I tear the
cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name. Romeo: It is my soul that calls upon
my name: How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest
music to attending ears! 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 158

Juliet: 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone; And yet no further
than a wanton's bird, Who lets it hop a little from her hand, Like a
poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silk thread plucks it
back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty. Romeo: I would I were thy
bird. Juliet: Sweet, so would I: Yet I should kill thee with much
cherishing. Good-night, good-night! parting is such sweet sorrow That I
shall say good-night till it be morrow. Romeo: Sleep dwell upon thine
eyes, peace in thy breast! Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to
rest! 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 2, sc. 2, l. 176

One, two, and the third in your bosom. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 2,

O! I am Fortune's fool. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 3, sc. 1, l.
\[142\]

Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, Towards Phoebus' lodging; such a
waggoner As Phaethon would whip you to the west, And bring in cloudy
night immediately. Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night! That
runaway's eyes may wink, and Romeo Leap to these arms, untalked of and
unseen! Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties;
or, if love be blind, It best agrees with night. Come, civil night, Thou
sober-suited matron, all in black. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 3, sc.
2, l. 1

Come, night! come, Romeo! come, thou day in night! For thou wilt lie
upon the wings of night, Whiter than new snow on a raven's back. Come,
gentle night; come, loving, black-browed night, Give me my Romeo: and,
when he shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will
make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with
night, And pay no worship to the garish sun. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595)
act 3, sc. 2, l. 17

He was not born to shame:

Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 3,

Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man: Affliction is enamoured
of thy parts, And thou art wedded to calamity. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595)
act 3, sc. 3, l. 1

Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe, And smil'st upon the stroke
that murders me. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 3, sc. 3, l. 22

Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 3, sc.

Hang up philosophy! Unless philosophy can make a Juliet. 'Romeo And

O Lord, I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel. O,
what learning is! 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 3, sc. 3, l. 159

Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day: It was the nightingale, and
not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear; Nightly she
sings on yon pomegranate tree: Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 3, sc. 5, l. 1

Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty

Is there no pity sitting in the clouds, That sees into the bottom of my
grief? 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 3, sc. 5, l. 198

Romeo's a dishclout to him. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 3, sc. 5, l.

Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act

Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.

I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins, That almost freezes
up the heat of life. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 4, sc. 3, l. 14

Out, alas! she's cold; Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
Life and these lips have long been separated: Death lies on her like an
untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. 'Romeo And
Juliet' (1595) act 4, sc. 5, l. 25

My bosom's lord sits lightly on his throne; And all this day an

Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. 56

Romeo: The world is not thy friend nor the world's law: The world

take this. Apothecary: My poverty, but not my will, consents. Romeo: I
pay thy poverty, and not thy will. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 5, sc.

How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry! which
their keepers call A lightning before death. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595)

Beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And
death's pale flag is not advancéd there. 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act
5, sc. 3, l. 94

Shall I believe That unsubstantial Death is amorous, And that the lean
abhorréd monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour? For fear of
that I still will stay with thee,

And never from this palace of dim night Depart again: here, here will I
remain With worms that are thy chambermaids; O! here Will I set up my
everlasting rest, And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this
world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your last embrace!
and, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A
dateless bargain to engrossing death! 'Romeo And Juliet' (1595) act 5,

morning roses newly washed with dew: Say she be mute and will not speak
a word; Then I'll commend her volubility, And say she uttereth piercing
eloquence.

She is a woman, therefore may be wooed; She is a woman, therefore may be

I have had my labour for my travail. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act
1, sc. 1, l. \[73\]

Women are angels, wooing: Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the
doing;

That she beloved knows nought that knows not this: Men prize the thing
ungained more than it is. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 1, sc. 2, l.
\[310\]

The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre Observe degree,
priority, and place, Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
Office, and custom, in all line of order. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602)
act 1, sc. 3, l. 85

O! when degree is shaked, Which is the ladder to all high designs, The
enterprise is sick. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 1, sc. 3, l. 101

Take but degree away, untune that string, And, hark! what discord
follows; each thing meets In mere oppugnancy. 'Troilus And Cressida'
(1602) act 1, sc. 3, l. 109

The general's disdained By him one step below, he by the next, That next
by him beneath; so every step, Exampled by the first pace that is sick
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever Of pale and bloodless
emulation. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 1, sc. 3, l. 129

We are soldiers; And may that soldier a mere recreant prove, That means

And in such indexes, although small pricks To their subsequent volumes,

Achilles...who wears his wit in his belly, and his guts in his head,

sc. 1, l. \[78\]

You have both said well; And on the cause and question now in hand Have
glozed but superficially; not much Unlike young men, whom Aristotle
thought

Unfit to hear moral philosophy. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 2, sc.
2, l. 163

Thus to persist In doing wrong extenuates not wrong, But makes it much
more heavy. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 2, sc. 2, l. 186

I am giddy, expectation whirls me round. The imaginary relish is so
sweet That it enchants my sense. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 3,
sc. 2, l. \[17\]

This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will is infinite, and
the execution confined; that the desire is boundless, and the act a
slave to limit. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[85\]

To be wise, and love, Exceeds man's might. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602)

I am as true as truth's simplicity, And simpler than the infancy of
truth. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 3, sc. 2, l. \[176\]

Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back, Wherein he puts alms for
oblivion, A great-sized monster of ingratitudes: Those scraps are good
deeds past; which are devoured As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
As done. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 3, sc. 3, l. 145

Perseverance, dear my lord, Keeps honour bright: to have done, is to
hang Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail In monumental mockery.
'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 3, sc. 3, l. 150

Time is like a fashionable host That slightly shakes his parting guest
by the hand, And with his arms outstretched, as he would fly, Grasps in
the comer: welcome ever smiles, And farewell goes out sighing. 'Troilus
And Cressida' (1602) act 3, sc. 3, l. 165

Beauty, wit, High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service, Love,
friendship, charity, are subjects all

To envious and calumniating time. One touch of nature makes the whole
world kin, That all with one consent praise new-born gawds, Though they
are made and moulded of things past, And give to dust that is a little
gilt More laud than gilt o'er-dusted. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act
3, sc. 3, l. 171

A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both sides, like a leather
jerkin. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 3, sc. 3, l. \[267\]

How my achievements mock me! 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 4, sc. 2,

What a pair of spectacles is here! 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 4,
sc. 4, l. \[13\] (Pandarus, of the lovers)

We two, that with so many thousand sighs Did buy each other, must poorly
sell ourselves With the rude brevity and discharge of one. Injurious
time now with a robber's haste Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not
how: As many farewells as be stars in heaven, With distinct breath and
consigned kisses to them, He fumbles up into a loose adieu, And scants
us with a single famished kiss, Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 4, sc. 4, l. \[39\]

Fie, fie upon her! There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip, Nay,
her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out At every joint and motive
of her body. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 4, sc. 5, l. 54

What's past, and what's to come is strewed with husks And formless ruin
of oblivion. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602) act 4, sc. 5, l. 165

The end crowns all, And that old common arbitrator, Time, Will one day

Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery: nothing else holds fashion.

Hector is dead; there is no more to say. 'Troilus And Cressida' (1602)

O world! world! world! thus is the poor agent despised. O traitors and
bawds, how earnestly are you set a-work, and how ill requited! why
should our endeavour be so loved, and the performance so loathed?

7.66.35 Twelfth Night

If music be the food of love, play on; Give me excess of it, that,
surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die. That strain again! it
had a dying fall: O! it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound That
breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odour! Enough! no
more: 'Tis not so sweet now as it was before. O spirit of love! how
quick and fresh art thou, That notwithstanding thy capacity Receiveth as
the sea, nought enters there, Of what validity and pitch soe'er, But
falls into abatement and low price, Even in a minute: so full of shapes
is fancy, That it alone is high fantastical. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act
1, sc. 1, l. 1

O! when mine eyes did see Olivia first, Methought she purged the air of
pestilence. That instant was I turned into a hart, And my desires, like
fell and cruel hounds, E'er since pursue me. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act

He plays o' the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word

Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary

Sir Andrew: I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have

Sir Toby: Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair. 'Twelfth Night'

Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have these gifts a curtain
before 'em? are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture?
why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a
coranto? My very walk should be a jig. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 1, sc.

Is it a world to hide virtues in? 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 1, sc. 3,

They shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man: Diana's
lip Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe Is as the maiden's
organ, shrill and sound; And all is semblative a woman's part. 'Twelfth

Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act

What says Quinapalus? 'Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.' 'Twelfth

Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that amends is

Good my mouse of virtue, answer me. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 1, sc. 5,

A plague o' these pickle herring! 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 1, sc. 5,

Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash is
before 'tis a peascod, or a codling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with

and he speaks very shrewishly: one would think his mother's milk were
scarce out of him. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 1, sc. 5, l. \[166\]

I would be loath to cast away my speech, for besides that it is
excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. 'Twelfth

Item, Two lips, indifferent red; Item, Two grey eyes with lids to them;
Item, One neck, one chin, and so forth. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 1,

Make me a willow cabin at your gate, And call upon my soul within the

the babbling gossip of the air Cry out, 'Olivia!' O! you should not rest
Between the elements of air and earth, But you should pity me! 'Twelfth

O mistress mine! where are you roaming? O! stay and hear; your true
love's coming, That can sing both high and low. Trip no further, pretty
sweeting; Journeys end in lovers meeting, Every wise man's son doth
know... What is love? 'tis not hereafter; Present mirth hath present
laughter; What's to come is still unsure: In delay there lies no plenty;
Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty, Youth's a stuff will not endure.

I thought that, I'd beat him like a dog! 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 2,
sc. 3, l. \[153\]

I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love; wherein by the
colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the
expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself
most feelingly personated. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 2, sc. 3, l.
\[171\]

I was adored once too. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 2, sc. 3, l. \[200\]

act 2, sc. 3, l. \[184\]

Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song, That old and antique song we
heard last night; Methought it did relieve my passion much, More than
light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy-paced
times: Come, but one verse. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 2, sc. 4, l. 2

Duke: If ever thou shalt love, In the sweet pangs of it remember me; For
such as I am all true lovers are: Unstaid and skittish in all motions
else, Save in the constant image of the creature That is beloved. How
dost thou like this tune? Viola: It gives a very echo to the seat Where
love is enthroned. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 2, sc. 4, l. 15

Let still the woman take An elder than herself, so wears she to him, So
sways she level in her husband's heart: For, boy, however we do praise
ourselves, Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, More longing,
wavering, sooner lost and worn,

Than women's are. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 2, sc. 4, l. 29

Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold
the bent. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 2, sc. 4, l. 36

Mark it, Cesario; it is old and plain. The spinsters and the knitters in
the sun And the free maids that weave their thread with bones Do use to
chant it: it is silly sooth, And dallies with the innocence of love,
Like the old age. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 2, sc. 4, l. 43

Come away, come away, death, And in sad cypress let me be laid; Fly
away, fly away, breath: I am slain by a fair cruel maid. My shroud of

true Did share it. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 2, sc. 4, l. 51

Now, the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of
changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. 'Twelfth Night' (1601)
act 2, sc. 4, l. \[74\]

There is no woman's sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As
love doth give my heart; no woman's heart So big, to hold so much; they
lack retention. Alas! their love may be called appetite, No motion of
the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;
But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest so much. 'Twelfth
Night' (1601) act 2, sc. 4, l. \[95\]

Viola: My father had a daughter loved a man, As it might be, perhaps,
were I a woman, I should your lordship. Duke: And what's her history?
Viola: A blank, my lord. She never told her love, But let concealment,
like a worm i' the bud,

Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought; And with a green and
yellow melancholy, She sat like patience on a monument, Smiling at
grief. Was not this love indeed? We men may say more, swear more; but,
indeed, Our shows are more than will; for still we prove Much in our
vows, but little in our love. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 2, sc. 4, l.

greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. 'Twelfth Night'

singularity. She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who
commended thy yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
cross-gartered. 'Twelfth Night' (1601) act 2, sc. 5, l. \[165\]

Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript. 'Twelfth Night'

him so. 'The Two Gentlemen Of Verona' (1592-3) act 1, sc. 2, l. 23

Fie, fie! how wayward is this foolish love That, like a testy babe, will
scratch the nurse And presently all humbled kiss the rod! 'The Two
Gentlemen Of Verona' (1592-3) act 1, sc. 2, l. 55

O! how this spring of love resembleth The uncertain glory of an April

former love Is by a newer object quite forgotten. 'The Two Gentlemen Of

admiréd be. Is she kind as she is fair? For beauty lives with kindness:
Love doth to her eyes repair, To help him of his blindness; And, being
helped, inhabits there. Then to Silvia let us sing, That Silvia is
excelling; She excels each mortal thing Upon the dull earth dwelling; To
her let us garlands bring. 'The Two Gentlemen Of Verona' (1592-3) act 4,

such a day to-morrow as to-day, And to be boy eternal. 'The Winter's
Tale' (1610-1) act 1, sc. 2, l. 62

winter's pale.

The white sheet bleaching on the hedge, With heigh! the sweet birds, O,
how they sing! Doth set my pugging tooth on edge; For a quart of ale is
a dish for a king. The lark, that tirra-lirra chants, With, heigh! with,
heigh! the thrush and the jay, Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
While we lie tumbling in the hay. 'The Winter's Tale' (1610-1) act 4,

O Proserpina! For the flowers now that frighted thou let'st fall From
Dis's waggon! daffodils, That come before the swallow dares, and take

The winds of March with beauty; violets dim, But sweeter than the lids
of Juno's eyes Or Cytherea's breath; pale prime-roses, That die
unmarried, ere they can behold Bright Phoebus in his strength,---a
malady Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and The crown imperial;
lilies of all kinds, The flower-de-luce being one. 'The Winter's Tale'

What you do Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet, I'd have
you do it ever: when you sing, I'd have you buy and sell so; so give
alms; Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs, To sing them too:
when you do dance, I wish you A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
Nothing but that; move still, still so, And own no other function: each
your doing, So singular in each particular, Crowns what you are doing in
the present deed, That all your acts are queens. 'The Winter's Tale'

Beauty itself doth of itself persuade The eyes of men without an orator.

certain ending. 'The Rape Of Lucrece' (1594) l. 1611

7.66.40 Sonnets

To the onlie begetter of these insuing sonnets, Mr. W.H. 'Sonnets'
(1609) dedication (also attributed to Thomas Thorpe)

From fairest creatures we desire increase, That thereby beauty's rose
might never die. Sonnet 1

When forty winters shall besiege thy brow, And dig deep trenches in thy
beauty's field. Sonnet 2

Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee Calls back the lovely April
of her prime. Sonnet 3

Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly? Sweets with sweets war not,
joy delights in joy: Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not
gladly, Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy? If the true concord
of well-tuned sounds, By unions married, do offend thine ear, They do
but sweetly chide thee. Sonnet 8

When lofty trees I see barren of leaves, Which erst from heat did canopy
the herd, And summer's green all girded up in sheaves, Borne on the bier
with white and bristly beard. Sonnet 12

If I could write the beauty of your eyes And in fresh numbers number all
your graces, The age to come would say, 'This poet lies; Such heavenly
touches ne'er touched earthly faces.' So should my papers, yellowed with
their age, Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue, And your
true rights be termed a poet's rage And stretchéd metre of an antique
song. Sonnet 17

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more
temperate:

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's lease hath
all too short a date: Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines, And
often is his gold complexion dimmed; And every fair from fair sometime
declines, By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed; But thy
eternal summer shall not fade, Nor lose possession of that fair thou
ow'st, Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade, When in eternal
lines to time thou grow'st; So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. Sonnet 18

My glass shall not persuade me I am old, So long as youth and thou are
of one date; But when in thee time's furrows I behold, Then look I death
my days should expiate. Sonnet 22

As an unperfect actor on the stage, Who with his fear is put beside his
part, Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage, Whose strength's
abundance weakens his own heart; So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
The perfect ceremony of love's rite. Sonnet 23

O! let my books be then the eloquence And dumb presagers of my speaking
breast. Sonnet 23

The painful warrior famouséd for fight, After a thousand victories once
foiled, Is from the book of honour razéd quite, And all the rest forgot
for which he toil'd. Sonnet 25

Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed, The dear repose for limbs with
travel tired; But then begins a journey in my head To work my mind, when
body's work's expired. Sonnet 27

When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes I all alone beweep my
outcast state,

And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon myself and
curse my fate, Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, Featured like
him, like him with friends possessed, Desiring this man's art, and that
man's scope, With what I most enjoy contented least; Yet in these
thoughts myself almost despising, Haply I think on thee,---and then my
state, Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth, sings
hymns at heaven's gate; For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings. Sonnet 29

When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of
things past, I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought, And with old woes
new wail my dear times' waste: Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night, And weep afresh
love's long since cancelled woe, And moan the expense of many a vanished
sight: Then can I grieve at grievances foregone, And heavily from woe to
woe tell o'er The sad account of fore-bemoanéd moan, Which I new pay as
if not paid before. But if the while I think on thee, dear friend, All
losses are restored and sorrows end. Sonnet 30

Full many a glorious morning have I seen Flatter the mountain-tops with
sovereign eye, Kissing with golden face the meadows green, Gilding pale
streams with heavenly alchemy. Sonnet 33

But, out! alack! he was but one hour mine, The region cloud hath masked
him from me now. Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth; Suns of
the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth. Sonnet 33

Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day, And make me travel forth
without my cloak

To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way, Hiding thy bravery in their
rotten smoke? Sonnet 34

Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud; Clouds and eclipses stain
both moon and sun, And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. All men
make faults. Sonnet 35

As a decrepit father takes delight To see his active child do deeds of
youth, So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite, Take all my comfort
of thy worth and truth. Sonnet 37

Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass, And scarely greet me
with that sun, thine eye, When love, converted from the thing it was,
Shall reasons find of settled gravity. Sonnet 49

What is your substance, whereof are you made, That millions of strange
shadows on you tend? Sonnet 53

O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which
truth doth give! Sonnet 54

Not marble, nor the gilded monuments Of princes, shall outlive this
powerful rime; But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than
unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time. Sonnet 55

Being your slave, what should I do but tend Upon the hours and times of
your desire? I have no precious time at all to spend, Nor services to
do, till you require. Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour Whilst
I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you, Nor think the bitterness of
absence sour When you have bid your servant once adieu; Nor dare I
question with my jealous thought Where you may be, or your affairs
suppose, But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought

Save, where you are, how happy you make those. So true a fool is love
that in your will, Though you do anything, he thinks no ill. Sonnet 57

Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, So do our minutes
hasten to their end. Sonnet 60

Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth And delves the parallels in
beauty's brow. Sonnet 60

Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye. Sonnet 62

When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced The rich-proud cost of
outworn buried age. Sonnet 64

When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the
shore. Sonnet 64

Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea, But sad mortality
o'ersways their power, How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
Whose action is no stronger than a flower? Sonnet 65

Tired with all these, for restful death I cry, As to behold desert a
beggar born, And needy nothing trimmed in jollity, And purest faith
unhappily forsworn, And gilded honour shamefully misplaced, And maiden
virtue rudely strumpeted, And right perfection wrongfully disgraced, And
strength by limping sway disabled, And art made tongue-tied by
authority, And folly---doctor-like---controlling skill, And simple truth
miscalled simplicity, And captive good attending captain ill: Tired with
all these, from these I would be gone, Save that, to die, I leave my
love alone. Sonnet 66

No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly
sullen bell

Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world, with
vilest worms to dwell. Sonnet 71

That time of year thou mayst in me behold When yellow leaves, or none,
or few, do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, Bare
ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. In me thou see'st the
twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in the west; Which by and by
black night doth take away, Death's second self, that seals up all in
rest. Sonnet 73

This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, To love that
well which thou must leave ere long. Sonnet 73

O! know, sweet love, I always write of you, And you and love are still
my argument; So all my best is dressing old words new, Spending again
what is already spent. Sonnet 76

Time's thievish progress to eternity. Sonnet 77

Was it the proud full sail of his great verse, Bound for the prize of
all too precious you, That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew? Sonnet 86

That affable familiar ghost Which nightly gulls him with intelligence.
Sonnet 86

Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing, And like enough thou
know'st thy estimate: The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing; My
bonds in thee are all determinate. For how do I hold thee but by thy
granting? And for that riches where is my deserving? The cause of this
fair gift in me is wanting, And so my patent back again is swerving.
Thyself thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing, Or me, to whom thou
gav'st it, else mistaking;

So thy great gift, upon misprision growing, Comes home again, on better
judgment making. Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter, In sleep
a king, but, waking, no such matter. Sonnet 87

Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow, Come in the rearward
of a conquered woe; Give not a windy night a rainy morrow, To linger out
a purposed overthrow. Sonnet 90

They that have power to hurt and will do none, That do not do the thing
they most do show, Who, moving others, are themselves as stone, Unmovéd,
cold, and to temptation slow; They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
And husband nature's riches from expense; They are the lords and owners
of their faces, Others but stewards of their excellence. The summer's
flower is to the summer sweet, Though to itself it only live and die,
But if that flower with base infection meet, The basest weed outbraves
his dignity: For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds; Lilies
that fester smell far worse than weeds. Sonnet 94

How like a winter hath my absence been From thee, the pleasure of the
fleeting year! What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen! What old
December's bareness every where! Sonnet 97

From you have I been absent in the spring, When proud-pied April,
dressed in all his trim, Hath put a spirit of youth in everything.
Sonnet 98

When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest
wights, And beauty making beautiful old rime, In praise of ladies dead
and lovely knights. Sonnet 106

For we, which now behold these present days,

Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise. Sonnet 106

Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world dreaming on
things to come, Sonnet 107

And thou in this shalt find thy monument, When tyrants' crests and tombs
of brass are spent. Sonnet 107

O! never say that I was false of heart, Though absence seemed my flame
to qualify. Sonnet 109

Alas! 'tis true I have gone here and there, And made myself a motley to
the view, Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear, Made
old offences of affections new; Most true it is that I have looked on
truth Askance and strangely; but, by all above, These blenches gave my
heart another youth, And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
Sonnet 110

My nature is subdued To what it works in, like the dyer's hand; Pity me,
then, and wish I were renewed. Sonnet 111

Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not
love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to
remove: O, no! it is an ever-fixéd mark, That looks on tempests and is
never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark, Whose worth's
unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though
rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; Love
alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the
edge of doom. If this be error, and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no
man ever loved. Sonnet 116

What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,

Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within, Applying fears to hopes,
and hopes to fears, Still losing when I saw myself to win! Sonnet 119

The expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action; and till
action, lust Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame, Savage,
extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust; Enjoyed no sooner but despiséd
straight; Past reason hunted; and no sooner had, Past reason hated, as a
swallowed bait, On purpose laid to make the taker mad: Mad in pursuit,
and in possession so; Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme; A
bliss in proof,---and proved, a very woe; Before, a joy proposed;
behind, a dream. All this the world well knows; yet none knows well: To
shun the heaven that leads men to this hell. Sonnet 129

My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than
her lips' red: If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs
be wires, black wires grow on her head. Sonnet 130

And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare As any she belied with false
compare. Sonnet 130

Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will, And Will to boot, and Will in
over-plus. Sonnet 135

When my love swears that she is made of truth, I do believe her, though
I know she lies. Sonnet 138

Two loves I have of comfort and despair, Which like two spirits do
suggest me still: The better angel is a man right fair, The worser
spirit a woman coloured ill. Sonnet 144

Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth, \[Fooled by\] these rebel
powers that thee array,

Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth, Painting thy outward walls
so costly gay? Why so large cost, having so short a lease, Dost thou
upon thy fading mansion spend? Sonnet 146

So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men, And Death once dead,
there's no more dying then. Sonnet 146

Past cure I am, now Reason is past care, And frantic-mad with evermore
unrest; My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are, At random from the
truth vainly expressed; For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee
bright, Who art as black as hell, as dark as night. Sonnet 147

7.66.42 Venus And Adonis

If the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I shall be sorry it
had so noble a godfather. 'Venus And Adonis' (1593) dedication

Hunting he loved, but love he laughed to scorn. 'Venus And Adonis'
(1593) l. 4

Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear, Or like a fairy trip upon
the green, Or, like a nymph, with long dishevelled hair, Dance on the
sands, and yet no footing seen: Love is a spirit all compact of fire,
Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire. 'Venus And Adonis' (1593)
l. 145

Round-hoofed, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long, Broad breast, full
eye, small head and nostril wide, High crest, short ears, straight legs
and passing strong, Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:
Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,

Save a proud rider on so proud a back. 'Venus And Adonis' (1593) l. 295

By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill, Stands on his hinder legs with
listening ear, To hearken if his foes pursue him still. 'Venus And
Adonis' (1593) l. 697

declares that it is his duty. 'Caesar and Cleopatra' (1901) act 3

A man of great common sense and good taste, meaning thereby a man
without originality or moral courage. 'Notes to Caesar and Cleopatra'

We have no more right to consume happiness without producing it than to
consume wealth without producing it. 'Candida' (1898) act 1

Do you think that the things people make fools of themselves about are
any less real and true than the things they behave sensibly about? They
are more true: they are the only things that are true. 'Candida' (1898)
act 1

It is easy---terribly easy---to shake a man's faith in himself. To take
advantage of that to break a man's spirit is devil's work. 'Candida'
(1898) act 1

I'm only a beer teetotaller, not a champagne teetotaller. 'Candida'

up to date. 'Fanny's First Play' (1914) 'Induction'

Home life as we understand it is no more natural to us than a cage is
natural to a cockatoo. 'Getting Married' (1911) preface 'Hearth and
Home'

The one point on which all women are in furious secret rebellion against
the existing law is the saddling of the right to a child with the
obligation to become the servant of a man. 'Getting Married' (1911)
preface 'The Right to Motherhood'

Physically there is nothing to distinguish human society from the
farm-yard except that children are more troublesome and costly than
chickens and calves, and that men and women are not so completely
enslaved as farm stock. 'Getting Married' (1911) preface 'The Personal
Sentimental Basis of Monogamy'

What God hath joined together no man ever shall put asunder: God will
take care of that. 'Getting Married' (1911) p. 216.

I am a woman of the world, Hector; and I can assure you that if you will
only take the trouble always to do the perfectly correct thing, and to

'Heartbreak House' (1919) act 1

Go anywhere in England where there are natural, wholesome, contented,
and really nice English people; and what do you always find? That the
stables are the real centre of the household. 'Heartbreak House' (1919)
act 3

The captain is in his bunk, drinking bottled ditch-water; and the crew
is gambling in the forecastle. She will strike and sink and split. Do
you think the laws of God will be suspended in favour of England because
you were born in it? 'Heartbreak House' (1919) act 3

Money is indeed the most important thing in the world; and all sound and
successful personal and national morality should have this fact for its
basis. 'The Irrational Knot' (1905) preface

Reminiscences make one feel so deliciously aged and sad. 'The Irrational
Knot' (1905) ch. 14

A man who has no office to go to---I don't care who he is---is a trial
of which you can have no conception. 'The Irrational Knot' (1905) ch. 18

An Irishman's heart is nothing but his imagination. 'John Bull's Other
Island' (1907) act 1

What really flatters a man is that you think him worth flattering. 'John
Bull's Other Island' (1907) act 4

There are only two qualities in the world: efficiency and inefficiency,
and only two sorts of people: the efficient and the inefficient.

'John Bull's Other Island' (1907) act 4

The greatest of evils and the worst of crimes is poverty...our first
duty---a duty to which every other consideration should be
sacrificed---is not to be poor. 'Major Barbara' (1907) preface

Nobody can say a word against Greek: it stamps a man at once as an
educated gentleman. 'Major Barbara' (1907) act 1

I am a Millionaire. That is my religion. 'Major Barbara' (1907) act 2

I can't talk religion to a man with bodily hunger in his eyes. 'Major

When the military man approaches, the world locks up its spoons and
packs off its womankind. 'Man and Superman' (1903) act 3

What is virtue but the Trade Unionism of the married? 'Man and Superman'
(1903) act 3

Those who talk most about the blessings of marriage and the constancy of
its vows are the very people who declare that if the chain were broken
and the prisoners were left free to choose, the whole social fabric
would fly asunder. You can't have the argument both ways. If the
prisoner is happy, why lock him in? If he is not, why pretend that he
is? 'Man and Superman' (1903) act 3

Beauty is all very well at first sight; but who ever looks at it when it

If you strike a child take care that you strike it in anger, even at the

Beware of the man whose god is in the skies. 'Man and Superman' (1903)
'Maxims: Religion'

Self-denial is not a virtue: it is only the effect of prudence on
rascality. 'Man and Superman' (1903) 'Maxims: Virtues and Vice'

A moderately honest man with a moderately faithful wife, moderate
drinkers both, in a moderately healthy house: that is the true middle
class unit. 'Man and Superman' (1903) 'Maxims: Moderation'

The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one
persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress

Self-sacrifice enables us to sacrifice other people without blushing.
'Man and Superman' (1903) 'Maxims: Self-Sacrifice'

There is nothing so bad or so good that you will not find Englishmen
doing it; but you will never find an Englishman in the wrong. He does
everything on principle. He fights you on

patriotic principles; he robs you on business principles; he enslaves
you on imperial principles; he bullies you on manly principles; he
supports his king on loyal principles and cuts off his king's head on
republican principles. 'The Man of Destiny' (1898) p. 201

There is only one religion, though there are a hundred versions of it.
'Plays Pleasant and Unpleasant' (1898) vol. 2, preface

The English have no respect for their language, and will not teach their
children to speak it. They spell it so abominably that no man can teach
himself what it sounds like. It is impossible for an Englishman to open
his mouth without making some other Englishman hate or despise him.

I weep for Adonais---he is dead! O, weep for Adonais! though our tears
Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head! 'Adonais' (1821) st. 1

He died, Who was the Sire of an immortal strain, Blind, old and lonely.

To that high Capital, where kingly Death Keeps his pale court in beauty
and decay, He came. 'Adonais' (1821) st. 7

Ah, woe is me! Winter is come and gone, But grief returns with the
revolving year. 'Adonais' (1821) st. 18

From the great morning of the world when first God dawned on Chaos.
'Adonais' (1821) st. 19

Alas! that all we loved of him should be, But for our grief, as if it
had not been, And grief itself be mortal! 'Adonais' (1821) st. 21

Whence are we, and why are we? Of what scene The actors or spectators?
'Adonais' (1821) st. 21

A pardlike Spirit, beautiful and swift--- A Love in desolation
masked;---a Power Girt round with weakness;---it can scarce uplift The
weight of the superincumbent hour; It is a dying lamp, a falling shower,
A breaking billow;---even whilst we speak Is it not broken? 'Adonais'
(1821) st. 32

He wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead; Thou canst not soar where he
is sitting now--- Dust to the dust! but the pure spirit shall flow Back
to the burning fountain whence it came, A portion of the Eternal.
'Adonais' (1821) st. 38

He hath awakened from the dream of life--- 'Tis we, who lost in stormy
visions, keep With phantoms an unprofitable strife, And in mad trance,
strike with our spirit's knife Invulnerable nothings. 'Adonais' (1821)
st. 39

He has out-soared the shadow of our night;

Envy and calumny and hate and pain, And that unrest which men miscall
delight, Can touch him not and torture not again; From the contagion of
the world's slow stain He is secure, and now can never mourn A heart
grown cold, a head grown grey in vain. 'Adonais' (1821) st. 40

He lives, he wakes,---'tis Death is dead, not he. 'Adonais' (1821) st.
41

He is a portion of the loveliness Which once he made more lovely.
'Adonais' (1821) st. 43

The One remains, the many change and pass; Heaven's light forever
shines, Earth's shadows fly; Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,
Stains the white radiance of Eternity, Until Death tramples it to
fragments. 'Adonais' (1821) st. 52

A widow bird sat mourning for her love Upon a wintry bough; The frozen

That orbéd maiden, with white fire laden, Whom mortals call the Moon.
'The Cloud' (1819)

I am the daughter of Earth and Water, And the nursling of the Sky; I
pass through the pores of the ocean and shores; I change, but I cannot
die, For after the rain when with never a stain The pavilion of Heaven
is bare, And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams Build up
the blue dome of air, I silently laugh at my own cenotaph, And out of
the caverns of rain, Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the
tomb, I arise and unbuild it again. 'The Cloud' (1819)

How wonderful is Death,

Death and his brother Sleep! One pale as yonder wan and hornéd moon,
With lips of lurid blue, The other glowing like the vital morn, When
throned on ocean's wave It breathes over the world: Yet both so passing
strange and wonderful! 'The Daemon of the World' part 1, l. 1 (a
revision of the opening lines of 'Queen Mab')

I never was attached to that great sect, Whose doctrine is that each one
should select Out of the crowd a mistress or a friend, And all the rest,
though fair and wise, commend To cold oblivion. 'Epipsychidion' (1821)

The beaten road Which those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread, Who
travel to their home among the dead By the broad highway of the world,
and so With one chained friend, perhaps a jealous foe, The dreariest and
the longest journey go. 'Epipsychidion' (1821) l. 154

Let there be light! said Liberty, And like sunrise from the sea, Athens
arose! 'Hellas' (1822) l. 682

The world's great age begins anew, The golden years return, The earth
doth like a snake renew Her winter weeds outworn; Heaven smiles, and
faiths and empires gleam,

Like wrecks of a dissolving dream. 'Hellas' (1822) l. 1060

O cease! must hate and death return? Cease! must men kill and die?
Cease! drain not to its dregs the urn Of bitter prophecy. The world is
weary of the past, Oh, might it die or rest at last! 'Hellas' (1822) l.

The day becomes more solemn and serene When noon is past---there is a
harmony In autumn, and a lustre in its sky, Which through the summer is
not heard or seen, As if it could not be, as if it had not been! 'Hymn

I love all waste And solitary places; where we taste The pleasure of

You will see Coleridge---he who sits obscure In the exceeding lustre and
the pure Intense irradiation of a mind, Which, with its own internal
lightning blind, Flags wearily through darkness and despair--- A
cloud-encircled meteor of the air, A hooded eagle among blinking owls---
You will see Hunt---one of those happy souls Which are the salt of the
earth, and without whom This world would smell like what it is---a tomb.

When the lamp is shattered The light in the dust lies dead--- When the
cloud is scattered The rainbow's glory is shed. When the lute is broken,
Sweet tones are remembered not; When the lips have spoken, Loved accents
are soon forgot. 'Lines: When the lamp'

Beneath is spread like a green sea The waveless plain of Lombardy,
Bounded by the vaporous air, Islanded by cities fair; Underneath Day's
azure eyes Ocean's nursling, Venice lies, A peopled labyrinth of walls,
Amphitrite's destined halls. 'Lines written amongst the Euganean Hills'
(1818) l. 90

Sun-girt city, thou hast been Ocean's child, and then his queen;

Now is come a darker day, And thou soon must be his prey. 'Lines written
amongst the Euganean Hills' (1818) l. 115 (on Venice)

The fountains mingle with the river, And the rivers with the ocean; The
winds of heaven mix for ever With a sweet emotion; Nothing in the world
is single; All things, by a law divine, In one spirit meet and mingle.
Why not I with thine? 'Love's Philosophy'

I met Murder on the way--- He had a mask like Castlereagh. 'The Mask of
Anarchy' (1819) st. 2

His big tears, for he wept full well, Turned to mill-stones as they
fell. And the little children, who Round his feet played to and fro,
Thinking every tear a gem, Had their brains knocked out by them. 'The
Mask of Anarchy' (1819) st. 4 (on 'Fraud' \[Lord Eldon\])

Nought may endure but Mutability. 'Mutability' (1816)

I stood within the City disinterred; And heard the autumnal leaves like
light footfalls Of spirits passing through the streets; and heard The
Mountain's slumberous voice at intervals Thrill through those roofless
halls. 'Ode to Naples' (1820) l. 1

O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being, Thou, from whose unseen
presence the leaves dead Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter
fleeing, Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou, Who chariotest to their dark
wintry bed The wingéd seeds, where they lie cold and low, Each like a
corpse within its grave, until Thine azure sister of the spring shall
blow

Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill (Driving sweet buds like
flocks to feed in air) With living hues and odours plain and hill: Wild
Spirit, which art moving everywhere; Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh,
hear! 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819) l. 1

There are spread On the blue suface of thine aëry surge, Like the bright
hair uplifted from the head Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim
verge Of the horizon to the zenith's height, The locks of the
approaching storm. 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819) l. 18

Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams The blue Mediterranean,
where he lay, Lulled by the coil of his crystálline streams Beside a
pumice isle in Baiae's bay, And saw in sleep old palaces and towers
Quivering within the wave's intenser day, All overgrown with azure moss
and flowers So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! 'Ode to the West
Wind' (1819) l. 29

The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear The sapless foliage of the
ocean, know Thy voice, and suddenly grow grey with fear, And tremble and
despoil themselves. 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819) l. 39

Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud! I fall upon the thorns of life!
I bleed! 'Ode to the West Wind' (1819) l. 53

Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is: What if my leaves are falling
like its own! The tumult of thy mighty harmonies Will take from both a
deep, autumnal tone, Sweet though in sadness. 'Ode to the West Wind'
(1819) l. 57

And, by the incantation of this verse, Scatter, as from an
unextinguished hearth Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!

Be through my lips to unawakened earth The trumpet of a prophecy! O,
Wind, If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind? 'Ode to the West Wind'
(1819) l. 65

Its horror and its beauty are divine. 'On the Medusa of Leonardo da

I met a traveller from an antique land Who said: Two vast and trunkless
legs of stone Stand in the desert. 'Ozymandias'

wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.

Hell is a city much like London--- A populous and smoky city. 'Peter
Bell the Third' (1819) pt. 3, st. 1

But from the first 'twas Peter's drift To be a kind of moral eunuch, He
touched the hem of Nature's shift, Felt faint---and never dared uplift
The closest, all-concealing tunic. 'Peter Bell the Third' (1819) pt. 4,

My soul is an enchanted boat, Which, like a sleeping swan, doth float
Upon the silver waves of thy sweet singing. 'Prometheus Unbound' (1820)
act 2, scene 5, l. 72.

The loathsome mask has fallen, the man remains Sceptreless, free,
uncircumscribed, but man Equal, unclassed, tribeless, and nationless,
Exempt from awe, worship, degree, the king Over himself; just, gentle,
wise: but man Passionless?---no, yet free from guilt or pain, Which
were, for his will made or suffered them, Nor yet exempt, though ruling
them like slaves, From chance, and death, and mutability, The clogs of
that which else might oversoar The loftiest star of unascended heaven,
Pinnacled dim in the intense inane. 'Prometheus Unbound' (1820) act 3,
sc. 4, l. 193

A traveller from the cradle to the grave Through the dim night of this
immortal day. 'Prometheus Unbound' (1820) act 4, l. 551

To suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite;

To forgive wrongs darker than death or night; To defy Power, which seems
omnipotent; To love, and bear; to hope till Hope creates From its own
wreck the thing it contemplates; Neither to change, nor falter, nor
repent; This, like thy glory, Titan, is to be Good, great and joyous,
beautiful and free; This is alone Life, Joy, Empire and Victory.
'Prometheus Unbound' (1820) act 4, l. 570

That sweet bondage which is freedom's self. 'Queen Mab' (1813) canto 9,
l. 76

I dreamed that, as I wandered by the way, Bare Winter suddenly was
changed to Spring, And gentle odours led my steps astray, Mixed with a
sound of water's murmuring Along a shelving bank of turf, which lay
Under a copse, and hardly dared to fling Its green arms round the bosom
of the stream, But kissed it and then fled, as thou mightst in dream.
'The Question'

Daisies, those pearled Arcturi of the earth, The constellated flower
that never sets. 'The Question'

And in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine, Green cowbind and the

of earthquake and eclipse. 'The Revolt of Islam' (1818) canto 5, st. 23

A Sensitive Plant in a garden grew. 'The Sensitive Plant' (1820) pt. 1,

depth of her glowing breast, Till, fold after fold, to the fainting air
The soul of her beauty and love lay bare. 'The Sensitive Plant' (1820)
pt. 1, l. 29

And the jessamine faint, and the sweet tuberose, The sweetest flower for

Lift not the painted veil which those who live Call Life. 'Sonnet'

Through the unheeding many he did move, A splendour among shadows, a

like the Preacher found it not. 'Sonnet'

An old, mad, blind, despised, and dying king. 'Sonnet: England in 1819'

Away! the moor is dark beneath the moon, Rapid clouds have drank the
last pale beam of even: Away! the gathering winds will call the darkness
soon, And profoundest midnight shroud the serene lights of heaven.
'Stanzas---April 1814'

I see the waves upon the shore, Like light dissolved in star-showers,

Hail to thee, blithe Spirit! Bird thou never wert, That from Heaven, or
near it, Pourest thy full heart In profuse strains of unpremeditated
art. 'To a Skylark' (1819)

And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest. 'To a Skylark'
(1819)

Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun. 'To a Skylark' (1819)

Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight. 'To a Skylark'
(1819)

Like a Poet hidden In the light of thought, Singing hymns unbidden, Till
the world is wrought To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not. 'To
a Skylark' (1819)

With thy clear keen joyance Languor cannot be: Shadow of annoyance Never
came near thee: Thou lovest---but ne'er knew love's sad satiety. 'To a
Skylark' (1819)

We look before and after, And pine for what is not: Our sincerest
laughter With some pain is fraught; Our sweetest songs are those that
tell of saddest thought. 'To a Skylark' (1819)

Teach me half the gladness That thy brain must know, Such harmonious
madness From my lips would flow The world should listen then---as I am
listening now. 'To a Skylark' (1819)

Less oft is peace in Shelley's mind,

Than calm in waters, seen. 'To Jane: The Recollection'

Swiftly walk o'er the western wave, Spirit of Night! Out of the misty
eastern cave, Where, all the long and lone daylight, Thou wovest dreams
of joy and fear, Which make thee terrible and dear,--- Swift be thy
flight! 'To Night'

Death will come when thou art dead, Soon, too soon--- Sleep will come
when thou art fled; Of neither would I ask the boon I ask of thee,
belovéd Night--- Swift be thine approaching flight, Come soon, soon! 'To
Night'

Art thou pale for weariness Of climbing heaven, and gazing on the earth,
Wandering companionless Among the stars that have a different birth,---
And ever changing, like a joyless eye That finds no object worth its
constancy? 'To the Moon'

In honoured poverty thy voice did weave Songs consecrate to truth and
liberty,--- Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve, Thus having
been, that thou shouldst cease to be. 'To Wordsworth'

And like a dying lady, lean and pale, Who totters forth, wrapped in a
gauzy veil. 'The Waning Moon'

A lovely lady, garmented in light From her own beauty. 'The Witch of

For she was beautiful---her beauty made The bright world dim, and
everything beside Seemed like the fleeting image of a shade. 'The Witch

The rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer; and the
vessel of the state is driven between the Scylla and Charybdis of
anarchy and despotism. 'A Defence of Poetry' (written 1821, published
1840)

Poetry is the record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest
and best minds. 'A Defence of Poetry' (written 1821, published 1840)

Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the mirrors
of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present; the words
which express what they understand not; the trumpets which sing to
battle, and feel not what they inspire; the influence which is moved
not, but moves. Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.

Middle class people are apt to live up to their incomes, if not beyond

effects upon society at large. 'Self-Help' (1859)

As respects the great contrivances and inventions which have conferred
so much power and wealth upon the nation, it is unquestionable that for
the greater part of them we have been indebted to men of the humblest
rank. Deduct what they have done in this particular line of action, and
it will be found that very little indeed remains for other men to have
accomplished. 'Self-Help' (1859)

Though our brother is on the rack, as long as we ourselves are at our

Consumption is the sole end and purpose of production; and the interest

bk. 4, ch. 8

People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and
diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public,
or in some contrivance to raise prices. 'Wealth of Nations' (1776)

With the greater part of rich people, the chief enjoyment of riches
consists in the parade of riches, which in their eyes is never so
complete as when they appear to possess those decisive marks of opulence
which nobody can possess but themselves. 'Wealth of Nations' (1776)

To found a great empire for the sole purpose of raising up a people of
customers, may at first sight appear a project fit only for a nation of
shopkeepers. It is, however, a project altogether unfit for a nation of
shopkeepers; but extremely fit for a nation whose government is
influenced by shopkeepers. 'Wealth of Nations' (1776).

The discipline of colleges and universities is in general contrived, not

of draining money

If any of the provinces of the British empire cannot be made to
contribute towards the support of the whole empire, it is surely time
that Great Britain should free herself from the expense of defending
those provinces in time of war, and of supporting any part of their
civil or military establishments in time of peace, and endeavour to
accommodate her future views and designs to the real mediocrity of her
circumstances. 'Wealth of Nations' (1776)

almost made for each other. 'Sketches of Moral Philosophy' Lecture 9

A man should feel confident concerning his soul, who has renounced those
pleasures and fineries that go with the body, as being alien to him, and
considering them to result more in harm than in good, but has pursued
the pleasures that go with learning and made the soul fine with no alien
but rather its own proper refinements, moderation and justice and
courage and freedom and truth; thus it is ready for the journey to the
world below. In Plato 'Phaedo' 114d

'What do you say about pouring a libation to some god from this cup? Is
it allowed or not?' 'We only prepare just the right amount to drink,

Illness is the night-side of life, a more onerous citizenship. Everyone
who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in
the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer to use only the good
passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell,
to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place. 'New York Review
of Books' 26 January 1978

The white race is the cancer of human history, it is the white race, and
it alone---its ideologies and inventions---which eradicates autonomous
civilizations wherever it spreads, which has upset the ecological
balance of the planet, which now threatens the very existence of life
itself. 'Partisan Review' Winter 1967, p. 57

And eke my name be wipéd out likewise. Not so, quoth I, let baser things
devise To die in dust, but you shall live by fame:

shall live, and later life renew. 'Amoretti' (1595) sonnet 75

It is the nature of an hypothesis, when once a man has conceived it,
that it assimilates every thing to itself, as proper nourishment; and,
from the first moment of your begetting it, it generally grows the

True Shandeism, think what you will against it, opens the heart and
lungs, and like all those affections which partake of its nature, it
forces the blood and other vital fluids of the body to run freely
through its channels, and makes the wheel of life run long and
cheerfully round. 'Tristram Shandy' (1759-67) bk. 4, ch. 32

'There is no terror, brother Toby, in its \[death's\] looks, but what it

it down, dropped a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for ever.
'Tristram Shandy' (1759-67) bk. 6, ch. 8

To say a man is fallen in love,---or that he is deeply in love,---or up
to the ears in love,---and sometimes even over head and ears in
it,---carries an idiomatical kind of implication, that love is a thing
below a man:---this is recurring again to Plato's opinion, which, with
all his divinityship, ---I hold to be damnable and heretical:---and so
much for that. Let love therefore be what it will, ---my uncle Toby fell
into it. 'Tristram Shandy' (1759-67) bk. 6, ch. 37

Just as my fingers on these keys Make music, so the self-same sounds On
my spirit make a music, too. Music is feeling, then, not sound; And thus
it is that what I feel, Here in this room, desiring you, Thinking of

Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings Of those white elders; but,

We live in an old chaos of the sun, Or old dependency of day and night,
Or island solitude, unsponsored, free, Of that wide water, inescapable.
Deers walk upon our mountains, and the quail Whistle about us their
spontaneous cries; Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness; And, in the
isolation of the sky, At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make
Ambiguous undulations as they sink, Downward to darkness, on extended
wings. 'Sunday Morning, I' (1923)

These are my politics: to change what we can; to better what we can; but

In winter I get up at night And dress by yellow candle-light. In summer,
quite the other way,--- I have to go to bed by day. I have to go to bed
and see The birds still hopping on the tree, Or hear the grown-up
people's feet Still going past me in the street. 'A Child's Garden of
Verses' (1885) 'Bed in Summmer'

The world is so full of a number of things, I'm sure we should all be as
happy as kings. 'A Child's Garden of Verses' (1885) 'Happy Thought'

plain, The pleasant land of counterpane. 'A Child's Garden of Verses'

Whenever the moon and stars are set, Whenever the wind is high, All

But all that I could think of, in the darkness and the cold, Was that I
was leaving home and my folks were growing old. 'Christmas at Sea'

Give to me the life I love, Let the lave go by me, Give the jolly heaven
above And the byway nigh me. Bed in the bush with stars to see, Bread I
dip in the river--- There's the life for a man like me, There's the life
for ever. 'Songs of Travel' (1896) 'The Vagabond'

Let the blow fall soon or late, Let what will be o'er me; Give the face

I will make you brooches and toys for your delight Of bird-song at
morning and star-shine at night. I will make a palace fit for you and me
Of green days in forests and blue days at sea. I will make my kitchen,

blows the broom, And you shall wash your linen and keep your body white
In rainfall at morning and dewfall at night. 'Songs of Travel' (1896) 'I

(1887) 'Requiem'

If I have faltered more or less In my great task of happiness; If I have
moved among my race And shown no glorious morning face; If beams from
happy human eyes Have moved me not; if morning skies, Books, and my
food, and summer rain Knocked on my sullen heart in vain:--- Lord, thy
most pointed pleasure take And stab my spirit broad awake; Or, Lord, if
too obdurate I, Choose thou, before that spirit die, A piercing pain, a
killing sin, And to my dead heart run them in! 'Underwoods' (1887) 'The

Was it he who had been supple and yielding? he who had won by art what
he could never have won by force, and who had managed, so to speak, to
be one of the leaders of the procession less through merit than through
a superior faculty for gliding adroitly to the front rank? 'Eminent

When Jesus came to Golgotha they hanged Him on a tree, They drave great
nails through hands and feet, and made a Calvary. They crowned Him with
a crown of thorns, red were His wounds and deep, For those were crude
and cruel days, and human flesh was cheap. When Jesus came to Birmingham
they simply passed Him by, They never hurt a hair of Him, they only let
Him die. For men had grown more tender and they would not give Him pain,
They only just passed down the street, and left Him in the rain. 'Peace

edge between windward and lee, Walled round with rocks as an inland
island, The ghost of a garden fronts the sea. 'A Forsaken Garden'

As a god self-slain on his own strange altar, Death lies dead. 'A
Forsaken Garden'

Pale, beyond porch and portal, Crowned with calm leaves, she stands Who
gathers all things mortal With cold immortal hands. 'The Garden of
Proserpine'

Yea, is not even Apollo, with hair and harpstring of gold, A bitter God

Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from Thy
breath; We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of
death. 'Hymn to Proserpine'.

Though these that were Gods are dead, and thou being dead art a God,
Though before thee the throned Cytherean be fallen, and hidden her head,
Yet thy kingdom shall pass, Galilean, thy dead shall go down to thee
dead. 'Hymn to Proserpine'

I remember the way we parted, The day and the way we met; You hoped we
were both broken-hearted, And knew we should both forget. 'An Interlude'

And the best and the worst of this is That neither is most to blame, If
you have forgotten my kisses And I have forgotten your name. 'An
Interlude'

Swallow, my sister, O sister swallow, How can thine heart be full of the
spring? A thousand summers are over and dead. What hast thou found in
the spring to follow? What hast thou found in thine heart to sing? What
wilt thou do when the summer is shed? 'Itylus' (1864)

Till life forget and death remember, Till thou remember and I forget.
'Itylus' (1864)

Ah, yet would God this flesh of mine might be Where air might wash and
long leaves cover me; Where tides of grass break into foam of flowers,
Or where the wind's feet shine along the sea. 'Laus Veneris' (1866)

If love were what the rose is, And I were like the leaf,

Our lives would grow together In sad or singing weather, Blown fields or
flowerful closes, Green pleasure or grey grief. 'A Match'

There was a poor poet named Clough, Whom his friends all united to puff,
But the public, though dull, Had not such a skull As belonged to

I shall sleep, and move with the moving ships, Change as the winds

Happiness is an imaginary condition, formerly often attributed by the

The characteristic virtue of Englishmen is power of sustained practical
activity and their characteristic vice a reluctance to test the quality
of that activity by reference to principles. 'The Acquisitive Society'
(1921)

Inequality, again, leads to misdirection of production. For, since the
demand of one income of £50,000 is as powerful a magnet as the demand of
500 incomes of £100, it diverts energy from the creation of wealth to
the multiplication of luxuries. 'The Acquisitive Society' (1921) ch. 4

Those who dread a dead-level of income or wealth...do not dread, it
seems, a dead-level of law and order, and of security of life and
property. 'Equality' (4th ed., 1931) p. 85

Both the existing economic order and too many of the projects advanced
for reconstructing it break down through their neglect of the truism
that, since even quite common men have souls, no increase in material
wealth will compensate them for arrangements which insult their
self-respect and impair their freedom. A reasonable estimate of economic
organisation must allow for the fact that, unless industry is to be
paralysed by recurrent revolts on the part of outraged human nature, it
must satisfy criteria which are not purely economic. 'Religion and the

faces, other minds. 'Idylls of the King' (1842-85) 'The Passing of
Arthur' (1869) l. 405

The old order changeth, yielding place to new, And God fulfils himself
in many ways, Lest one good custom should corrupt the world. 'Idylls of
the King' (1842-85) 'The Passing of Arthur' (1869) l. 408

If thou shouldst never see my face again, Pray for my soul. More things
are wrought by prayer Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy
voice Rise like a fountain for me night and day. For what are men better
than sheep or goats That nourish a blind life within the brain, If,
knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer Both for themselves and those
who call them friend? For so the whole round earth is every way Bound by
gold chains about the feet of God.

I am going a long way With these thou seëst---if indeed I go (For all my
mind is clouded with a doubt)--- To the island-valley of Avilion; Where
falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it
lies Deep-meadowed, happy, fair with orchard lawns And bowery hollows
crowned with summer sea, Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.
'Idylls of the King' (1842-85) 'The Passing of Arthur' (1869) l. 424

Our little systems have their day; They have their day and cease to be:
They are but broken lights of thee, And thou, O Lord, art more than
they. 'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) prologue

Let knowledge grow from more to more, But more of reverence in us dwell;
That mind and soul, according well, May make one music as before. 'In
Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) prologue

I held it truth, with him who sings To one clear harp in divers tones,
That men may rise on stepping-stones Of their dead selves to higher
things. 'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 1

For words, like Nature, half reveal And half conceal the Soul within.
'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 5

But, for the unquiet heart and brain, A use in measured language lies;

The sad mechanic exercise, Like dull narcotics, numbing pain. 'In

Doors, where my heart was used to beat So quickly, waiting for a hand.

And ghastly through the drizzling rain On the bald street breaks the
blank day. 'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 7

The last red leaf is whirled away, The rooks are blown about the skies.

away. 'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 48

Be near me when my light is low, When the blood creeps, and the nerves
prick And tingle; and the heart is sick, And all the wheels of Being
slow. Be near me when the sensuous frame Is racked with pains that
conquer trust; And Time, a maniac scattering dust, And Life, a Fury
slinging flame. 'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 50

Oh yet we trust that somehow good Will be the final goal of ill. 'In
Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 54

That nothing walks with aimless feet; That not one life shall be
destroyed, Or cast as rubbish to the void, When God hath made the pile
complete. 'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 54

Behold, we know not anything; I can but trust that good shall fall At
last---far off---at last, to all, And every winter change to spring. So
runs my dream: but what am I? An infant crying in the night: An infant
crying for the light: And with no language but a cry. 'In Memoriam A. H.
H.' (1850) canto 54

creed. 'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 56

come away: we do him wrong To sing so wildly: let us go. 'In Memoriam A.
H. H.' (1850) canto 57

O Sorrow, wilt thou live with me No casual mistress, but a wife. 'In
Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 59

As some divinely gifted man, Whose life in low estate began And on a
simple village green; Who breaks his birth's invidious bar, And grasps
the skirts of happy chance, And breasts the blows of circumstance, And
grapples with his evil star. 'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 64

So many worlds, so much to do, So little done, such things to be. 'In
Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 73

Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky, The flying cloud, the frosty
light: The year is dying in the night; Ring out, wild bells, and let him
die. Ring out the old, ring in the new, Ring, happy bells, across the
snow: The year is going, let him go; Ring out the false, ring in the
true. 'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 106

Ring out the want, the care, the sin, The faithless coldness of the
times; Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes, But ring the fuller
minstrel in. Ring out false pride in place and blood, The civic slander
and the spite; Ring in the love of truth and right, Ring in the common
love of good. Ring out old shapes of foul disease; Ring out the
narrowing lust of gold; Ring out the thousand wars of old, Ring in the
thousand years of peace. Ring in the valiant man and free, The larger
heart, the kindlier hand; Ring out the darkness of the land;

Ring in the Christ that is to be. 'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto
106

Not the schoolboy heat, The blind hysterics of the Celt. 'In Memoriam A.

About the flowering squares, and thick By ashen roots the violets blow.

And drowned in yonder living blue The lark becomes a sightless song. 'In
Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 115

There, where the long street roars, hath been The stillness of the
central sea. 'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 123

And thou art worthy; full of power; As gentle; liberal-minded, great,
Consistent; wearing all that weight Of learning lightly like a flower.
'In Memoriam A. H. H.' (1850) canto 131, st. 13

One God, one law, one element, And one far-off divine event, To which

The voice of the dead was a living voice to me. 'In the Valley of
Cauteretz' (1864)

Below the thunders of the upper deep; Far, far beneath in the abysmal
sea, His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep The Kraken sleepeth. 'The
Kraken' (1830)

There hath he lain for ages and will lie Battening upon huge seaworms in
his sleep, Until the latter fire shall heat the deep. 'The Kraken'

A bow-shot from her bower-eaves, He rode between the barley-sheaves, The
sun came dazzling through the leaves, And flamed upon the brazen greaves
Of bold Sir Lancelot. A red-cross knight for ever kneeled To a lady in
his shield, That sparkled on the yellow field, Beside remote Shalott.
'The Lady of Shalott' (1832, revised 1842) pt. 3

All in the blue unclouded weather

helmet-feather Burned like one burning flame together, As he rode down
to Camelot. 'The Lady of Shalott' (1832, revised 1842) pt. 3

She left the web, she left the loom, She made three paces through the
room, She saw the water-lily bloom, She saw the helmet and the plume,
She looked down to Camelot. Out flew the web and floated wide; The
mirror cracked from side to side; 'The curse is come upon me,' cried The
Lady of Shalott. 'The Lady of Shalott' (1832, revised 1842) pt. 3

Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new: That
which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do: For I
dipped into the future, far as human eye could see, Saw the vision of
the world, and all the wonder that would be; Saw the heavens fill with
commerce, argosies of magic sails,

Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales; Heard
the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained a ghastly dew From the
nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue; Far along the
world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm, With the standards of
the peoples plunging through the thunder-storm; Till the war-drum
throbbed no longer, and the battle-flags were furled In the Parliament
of man, the Federation of the world. 'Locksley Hall' (1842) l. 117

golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world. 'The Lotos-Eaters'
(1832) Choric Song, st. 8 (1842 revision)

Weeded and worn the ancient thatch Upon the lonely moated grange. She
only said, 'My life is dreary, He cometh not,' she said; She said, 'I am
aweary, aweary, I would that I were dead!' Her tears fell with the dews
at even; Her tears fell ere the dews were dried. 'Mariana' (1830) st. 1.

Come into the garden, Maud, For the black bat, night, has flown, Come
into the garden, Maud, I am here at the gate alone; And the woodbine
spices are wafted abroad, And the musk of the rose is blown. For a

faint in the light that she loves On a bed of daffodil sky. 'Maud'

There has fallen a splendid tear From the passion-flower at the gate.
She is coming, my dove, my dear; She is coming, my life, my fate; The
red rose cries, 'She is near, she is near;' And the white rose weeps,
'She is late;' The larkspur listens, 'I hear, I hear;' And the lily
whispers, 'I wait.' She is coming, my own, my sweet; Were it ever so
airy a tread, My heart would hear her and beat, Were it earth in an
earthy bed; My dust would hear her and beat; Had I lain for a century
dead; Would start and tremble under her feet, And blossom in purple and
red. 'Maud' (1855) pt. 1, sect. 22, st. 10

God, and the doom assigned. 'Maud' (1855) pt. 3, sect. 6, st. 5

Blow him again to me; While my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps.

And thinner, clearer, farther going! O sweet and far from cliff and scar
The horns of Elfland faintly blowing! 'The Princess' (1847) pt. 4, song

Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean, Tears from the depth of
some divine despair Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes, In
looking on the happy autumn-fields, And thinking of the days that are no
more. 'The Princess' (1847) pt. 4, l. 21, song (added 1850)

So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more. 'The Princess' (1847)
pt. 4, l. 30, song (added 1850)

Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns The earliest pipe of
half-awakened birds To dying ears, when unto dying eyes The casement
slowly grows a glimmering square; So sad, so strange, the days that are
no more. Dear as remembered kisses after death, And sweet as those by
hopeless fancy feigned On lips that are for others; deep as love,

Deep as first love, and wild with all regret; O Death in Life, the days
that are no more. 'The Princess' (1847) pt. 4, l. 31, song (added 1850)

O Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying South, Fly to her, and fall upon her
gilded eaves, And tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee. O tell her,
Swallow, thou that knowest each, That bright and fierce and fickle is
the South, And dark and true and tender is the North. 'The Princess'
(1847) pt. 4, l. 75, song (added 1850)

O tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is flown: Say to her, I do but
wanton in the South, But in the North long since my nest is made. 'The
Princess' (1847) pt. 4, l. 90, song (added 1850)

Man is the hunter; woman is his game: The sleek and shining creatures of
the chase, We hunt them for the beauty of their skins; They love us for
it, and we ride them down. 'The Princess' (1847) pt. 5, l. 147

Home they brought her warrior dead. She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:

Ask me no more: what answer should I give? I love not hollow cheek or
faded eye: Yet, O my friend, I will not have thee die! Ask me no more,
lest I should bid thee live. 'The Princess' (1847) pt. 7, song (added
1850)

Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white; Nor waves the cypress in
the palace walk; Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font:

The fire-fly wakens: waken thou with me. Now droops the milk white
peacock like a ghost, And like a ghost she glimmers on to me. Now lies
the Earth all Danaë to the stars, And all thy heart lies open unto me.
Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves A shining furrow, as thy
thoughts in me. Now folds the lily all her sweetness up, And slips into
the bosom of the lake: So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip Into
my bosom and be lost in me. 'The Princess' (1847) pt. 7, l. 161, song
(added 1850)

Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height: What pleasure lives in
height? 'The Princess' (1847) pt. 7, l. 177, song (added 1850)

For Love is of the valley, come thou down And find him; by the happy
threshold, he, Or hand in hand with Plenty in the maize, Or red with
spirted purple of the vats, Or foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk
With Death and Morning on the silver horns. 'The Princess' (1847) pt. 7,
l. 184, song (added 1850)

Sweet is every sound, Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;
Myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn, The moan of doves in
immemorial elms, And murmuring of innumerable bees. 'The Princess'
(1847) pt. 7, l. 203, song (added 1850)

No little lily-handed baronet he, A great broad-shouldered genial
Englishman, A lord of fat prize-oxen and of sheep, A raiser of huge
melons and of pine, A patron of some thirty charities, A pamphleteer on
guano and on grain. 'The Princess' (1847) 'Conclusion' l. 84

At Flores in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay, And a pinnace, like a
fluttered bird, came flying from far away: 'Spanish ships of war at sea!
we have sighted fifty-three!' Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: ''Fore God
I am no coward;

But I cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear, And the half
my men are sick. I must fly, but follow quick. We are six ships of the
line; can we fight with fifty-three?' Then spake Sir Richard Grenville:
'I know you are no coward; You fly them for a moment to fight with them
again. But I've ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore. I should
count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard, To these
Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain.' So Lord Howard passed away
with five ships of war that day, Till he melted like a cloud in the
silent summer heaven. 'The Revenge' (1878) st. 1

And Sir Richard said again: 'We be all good English men. Let us bang
these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil, For I never turned my
back upon Don or devil yet.' 'The Revenge' (1878) st. 4

And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,
But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three. 'The
Revenge' (1878) st. 9

'Sink me the ship, Master Gunner---sink her, split her in twain! Fall
into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!' And the gunner said
'Ay, ay,' but the seamen made reply: 'We have children we have wives,
And the Lord hath spared our lives.' 'The Revenge' (1878) st. 11

And they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace; But
he rose upon their decks, and he cried: 'I have fought for Queen and
Faith like a valiant man and true; I have only done my duty as a man is
bound to do: With a joyful spirit I Sir Richard Grenville die!' And he
fell upon their decks, and he died. 'The Revenge' (1878) st. 13

And the little Revenge herself went down by the island crags To be lost
evermore in the main. 'The Revenge' 1878) st. 14

My strength is as the strength of ten, Because my heart is pure. 'Sir

'Song---The Owl' (1830)

The woods decay, the woods decay and fall, The vapours weep their
burthen to the ground, Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath,
And after many a summer dies the swan. Me only cruel immortality
Consumes: I wither slowly in thine arms, Here at the quiet limit of the
world. 'Tithonus' (1860, revised 1864) l. 1

Why wilt thou ever scare me with thy tears, And make me tremble lest a

It little profits that an idle king,

By this still hearth, among these barren crags, Matched with an agéd
wife, I mete and dole Unequal laws unto a savage race. 'Ulysses' (1842)
l. 1

I will drink Life to the lees: all times I have enjoyed Greatly, have
suffered greatly, both with those That loved me, and alone; on shore,
and when Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades Vext the dim sea: I am
become a name; For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen
and known; cities of men And manners, climates, councils, governments,
Myself not least, but honoured of them all; And drunk delight of battle
with my peers, Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. I am a part of
all that I have met; Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough Gleams
that untravelled world, whose margin fades For ever and for ever when I
move. How dull it is to pause, to make an end, To rust unburnished, not
to shine in use! As though to breathe were life. 'Ulysses' (1842) l. 6

This grey spirit yearning in desire To follow knowledge like a sinking
star, Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. 'Ulysses' (1842) l. 30

There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail: There gloom the dark
broad seas. My mariners, Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and
thought with me--- That ever with a frolic welcome took The thunder and
the sunshine, and opposed Free hearts, free foreheads---you and I are
old; Old age hath yet his honour and his toil; Death closes all: but
something ere the end, Some work of noble note, may yet be done, Not
unbecoming men that strove with gods.

The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks: The long day wanes: the slow
moon climbs: the deep Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world. Push off, and sitting well in
order smite The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds To sail beyond
the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die. It may
be that the gulfs will wash us down: It may be we shall touch the Happy
Isles, And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. Though much is taken,
much abides; and though We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are; One equal temper of
heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive,
to seek, to find, and not to yield. 'Ulysses' (1842) l. 44

There is no expeditious road To pack and label men for God, And save

The angels keep their ancient places;--- Turn but a stone, and start a

sore loss Shall shine the traffic of Jacob's ladder Pitched betwixt
Heaven and Charing Cross. Yea, in the night, my Soul, my daughter,
Cry,---clinging Heaven by the hems; And lo, Christ walking on the water
Not of Gennesareth, but Thames! 'The Kingdom of God' (1913)

8.41 Henry David Thoreau 1817-62 I heartily accept the motto, 'That

governs not at all.' 'Civil Disobedience' (1849).

Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a
just man is also a prison. 'Civil Disobedience' (1849)

Some circumstantial evidence is very strong, as when you find a trout in

I do not perceive the poetic and dramatic capabilities of an anecdote or

do not enjoy poetry unless we know it to be poetry.

'Economy'

The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. 'Walden' (1854)
'Economy' (in Histoire da ma vie vol. 4 (1854) p. 438 George Sand
describes Chopin as being in a state of 'dèseperance tranquille' in the
period 1838-9)

It is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things. 'Walden'
(1854) 'Economy'

I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear
the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors.
'Walden' (1854) 'Economy'

There are now-a-days professors of philosophy but not philosophers.
'Walden' (1854) 'Economy'

I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on
their trail. 'Walden' (1854) 'Economy'

In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to
improve the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the
meeting of two eternities, the past and the future, which is precisely
the present moment; to toe that line. 'Walden' (1854) 'Economy'

It is true, I never assisted the sun materially in his rising, but,
doubt not, it was of the last importance only to be present at it.

Tall arrowy white pines. 'Walden' (1854) 'Economy'

The owner of the axe, as he released his hold on it, said that it was
the apple of his eye; but I returned it sharper than I received it.
'Walden' (1854) 'Economy'

For more than five years I maintained myself thus solely by the labor of
my hands, and I found, that by working about six weeks in a year, I
could meet all the expenses of living. 'Walden' (1854) 'Economy'

As for Doing-good, that is one of the professions which are full.
Moreover, I have tried it fairly, and, strange as it may seem, am
satisfied that it does not agree with my constitution. 'Walden' (1854)

The government of the world I live in was not framed, like that of
Britain, in after-dinner conversations over the wine. 'Walden' (1854)

the rarest. 'Walden' (1854) 'Sounds'.

Wherever a man goes, men will pursue him and paw him with their dirty
institutions, and, if they can, constrain him to belong to their
desperate oddfellow society. 'Walden' (1854) 'The Village'

I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life...to drive
life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved
to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and
publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by
experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next
excursion. 'Walden' (1854) 'Where I lived, and what I lived for'

Our life is frittered away by detail...Simplify, simplify. 'Walden'
(1854) 'Where I lived, and what I lived for'

I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep
an appointment with a beech-tree, or a yellow birch, or an old
acquaintance among the pines. 'Walden' (1854) 'Winter Visitors'

I once had a sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while I was
hoeing in a village garden, and I felt that I was more distinguished by
that circumstance than I should have been by any epaulet I could have
worn. 'Walden' (1854) 'Winter Visitors'

It has been proposed that the town should adopt for its coat of arms a
field verdant, with the Concord circling nine times round. 'A Week on

L'Anglais les baisse audessous de lui avec complaisance. C'est de part
et d'autre de l'orgueil, mais entendu de maniére diffèrente. The French
want no-one to be their superior. The English want inferiors. The
Frenchman constantly raises his eyes above him with anxiety. The
Englishman lowers his beneath him with satisfaction. On either side it
is pride, but understood in a different way. 'Voyage en Angleterre et en

C'est au milieu de ce cloaque infect que le plus grand fleuve de
l'industrie humaine prend sa source et va fèconder l'univers. De cet

perfectionne et s'abrutit; que la civilisation produit ses merveilles et
que l'homme civilisèe redevient presque sauvage. It is from the midst of
this putrid sewer that the greatest river of human industry springs up
and carries fertility to the whole world. From this foul drain pure gold
flows forth. Here it is that humanity achieves for itself both

The Men! O what venerable and reverend creatures did the aged seem!
Immortal Cherubims! And young men glittering and sparkling Angels, and

in any respect be wiser than ourselves. If any such point out to us our
follies, we at once claim those follies as the special evidences of our
wisdom. 'Orley Farm' (1862) ch. 18

It is because we put up with bad things that hotel-keepers continue to
give them to us. 'Orley Farm' (1862) ch. 18

As for conceit, what man will do any good who is not conceited? Nobody
holds a good opinion of a man who has a low opinion of himself. 'Orley
Farm' (1862) ch. 22

A fainèant government is not the worst government that England can have.
It has been the great fault of our politicians that they have all wanted
to do something. 'Phineas Finn' (1869) ch. 13

Mr Turnbull had predicted evil consequences...and was now doing the best
in his power to bring about the verification of his own prophecies.
'Phineas Finn' (1869) ch. 25

Perhaps there is no position more perilous to a man's honesty than
that...of knowing himself to be quite loved by a girl whom he almost
loves himself. 'Phineas Finn' (1869) ch. 50

She knew how to allure by denying, and to make the gift rich by delaying
it. 'Phineas Finn' (1869) ch. 57

Men are so seldom really good. They are so little sympathetic. What man
thinks of changing himself so as to suit his wife? And yet men expect
that women shall put on altogether new characters when they are married,
and girls think that they can do so. 'Phineas Redux' (1874) ch. 3

It is the necessary nature of a political party in this country to
avoid, as long as it can be avoided, the consideration of any question
which involves a great change...The best carriage horses are those which
can most steadily hold back against the coach as it trundles down the
hill. 'Phineas Redux' (1874) ch. 4

To think of one's absent love is very sweet; but it becomes monotonous
after a mile or two of a towing-path, and the mind will turn away to
Aunt Sally, the Cremorne Gardens, and financial questions. I doubt
whether any girl would be satisfied with her lover's mind if she knew
the whole of it. 'The Small House at Allington' (1864) ch. 4

Why is it that girls so constantly do this,---so frequently ask men who
have loved them to be present at their marriages with other men? There
is no triumph in it. It is done in sheer kindness and affection. They
intend to offer something which shall soften and not aggravate the
sorrow that they have caused...I fully appreciate the intention, but in
honest truth, I doubt the eligibility of the proffered entertainment.
'The Small House at Allington' (1864) ch. 9

It may almost be a question whether such wisdom as many of us have in
our mature years has not come from the dying out of the power of
temptation, rather than as the results of thought and resolution. 'The
Small House at Allington' (1864) ch. 14

And, above all things, never think that you're not good enough yourself.
A man should never think that. My belief is that in life people will
take you very much at your own reckoning. 'The Small House at Allington'
(1864) ch. 32

The tenth Muse, who now governs the periodical press. 'The Warden'
(1855) ch. 14

Is it not singular how some men continue to obtain the reputation of
popular authorship without adding a word to the literature of their
country worthy of note?...To puff and to get one's self puffed have
become different branches of a new profession. 'The Way We Live Now'

Love is like any other luxury. You have no right to it unless you can
afford it. 'The Way We Live Now' (1875) ch. 84

Where force is necessary, there it must be applied boldly, decisively

There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. 'The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' (1884) ch. 1

There was some books....One was 'Pilgrim's Progress', about a man that
left his family it didn't say why. I read considerable in it now and

Adam was but human---this explains it all. He did not want the apple for

There is a sumptuous variety about the New England weather that compels
the stranger's admiration---and regret. The weather is always doing
something there; always attending strictly to business; always getting
up new designs and trying them on the people to see how they will go.
But it gets through more business in spring than in any other season. In
the spring I have counted one hundred and thirty-six different kinds of
weather inside of four-and-twenty hours. Speech to New England Society,
22 December 1876, in 'Speeches' (1910) p. 59

There's plenty of boys that will come hankering and grovelling around

ain't-a-going to be no core. 'Tom Sawyer Abroad' (1894) ch. 1

An experienced, industrious, ambitious, and quite often picturesque
liar. 'Private History of a Campaign that Failed' in 'Century Magazine'
December 1885

The report of my death was an exaggeration. 'New York Journal' 2 June
1897 (often misquoted as 'Reports of my death have been greatly
exaggerated'). Twain was correcting newspaper reports to the effect that
he was ill or dead, and confusing him with his cousin, James Ross
Clemens, who had in fact been seriously ill in London.

He \[Thomas Carlyle\] said it in a moment of excitement, when chasing
Americans out of his backyard with brickbats. They used to go there and
worship. At bottom he was probably fond of them, but he was always able
to conceal it. 'Mark Twain's Christmas Book' in 'New York World' 10

This is our career and our triumph. Never in our full life could we hope

Wise Nicodemus saw such light As made him know his God by night. Most

expected healing wings could see When Thou didst rise! And, what can
never more be done, Did at midnight speak with the Sun! 'The Night' l. 5
from 'Silex Scintillans' (1650-5)

Dear Night! this world's defeat; The stop to busy fools; care's check
and curb; The day of spirits; my soul's calm retreat Which none disturb!
'The Night' l. 25 from 'Silex Scintillans' (1650-5)

My soul, there is a country Far beyond the stars, Where stands a wingéd
sentry All skilful in the wars; There, above noise and danger, Sweet
Peace is crowned with smiles, And One born in a manger Commands the
beauteous files. 'Peace' from 'Silex Scintillans' (1650-5)

Happy those early days, when I Shined in my angel-infancy. Before I
understood this place Appointed for my second race, Or taught my soul to
fancy aught But a white, celestial thought; When yet I had not walked
above A mile or two from my first love, And looking back---at that short
space--- Could see a glimpse of His bright face. 'The Retreat' l. 1 from
'Silex Scintillans' (1650-5)

And in those weaker glories spy Some shadows of eternity. 'The Retreat'

They are all gone into the world of light, And I alone sit lingering
here; Their very memory is fair and bright, And my sad thoughts doth
clear. 'They Are All Gone' from 'Silex Scintillans' (1650-5)

I see them walking in an air of glory, Whose light doth trample on my
days: My days, which are at best but dull and hoary, Mere glimmering and
decays. 'They Are All Gone' from 'Silex Scintillans' (1650-5)

Dear, beauteous death! the jewel of the just, Shining nowhere but in the
dark; What mysteries do lie beyond thy dust, Could man outlook that
mark! 'They Are All Gone' from 'Silex Scintillans' (1650-5)

And yet, as angels in some brighter dreams Call to the soul when man
doth sleep, So some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes, And
into glory peep. 'They Are All Gone' from 'Silex Scintillans' (1650-5)

I saw Eternity the other night, Like a great ring of pure and endless
light, All calm, as it was bright; And round beneath it, Time in hours,
days, years, Driv'n by the spheres Like a vast shadow moved; in which
the world And all her train were hurled. 'The World' from 'Silex

one who can speak or write to join in checking this mad, wicked folly of
'Woman's Rights', with all its attendant horrors, on which her poor

position. Letter to Sir Theodore Martin, 29 May 1870

Il est plaisant qu'on fait une vertu du vice de chastetè; et voilá
encore une drôle de chastetè que celle qui méne tout droit les hommes au
pèchè d'Onan, et les filles aux pâles couleurs! It is amusing that a
virtue is made of the vice of chastity; and it's a pretty odd sort of
chastity at that, which leads men straight into the sin of Onan, and
girls to the waning of their colour. Letter to M. Mariott, 28 March 1766

Je ne suis pas comme une dame de la cour de Versailles, qui disait:
c'est bien dommage que l'aventure de la tour de Babel ait produit la
confusion des langues; sans cela tout le monde aurait toujours parlè
français. I am not like a lady at the court of Versailles, who said:
'What a dreadful pity that the bother at the tower of Babel should have
got language all mixed up; but for that, everyone would always have
spoken French.'

It is more important that a proposition be interesting than that it be
true. This statement is almost a tautology. For the energy of operation
of a proposition in an occasion of experience is its interest, and is
its importance. But of course a true proposition is more apt to be
interesting than a false one. 'Adventures of Ideas' (1933) pt. 4, ch. 16

O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, The ship has weathered

hear, the people all exulting. 'O Captain! My Captain!'

The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done. From

Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be utterly
lost, That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly
wash again, and ever again, this soiled world; For my enemy is dead, a

still in the coffin---I draw near, Bend down and touch lightly with my
lips the white face in the coffin. 'Reconciliation'

A child said What is the grass? fetching it to one with full hands How
could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he. I
guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of the hopeful green
stuff woven. Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord, A scented
gift and remembrancer designedly dropt, Bearing the owner's name someway
in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say Whose?... And now it
seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves. 'Song of Myself' (1855)

I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,
And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of
the wren, And the tree toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest, And the
running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven. 'Song of Myself'
(1855) st. 31

I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and
self-contained, I stand and look at them long and long. They do not
sweat and whine about their condition, They do not lie awake in the dark
and weep for their sins, They do not make me sick discussing their duty
to God, Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of
owning things, Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived
thousands of years ago, Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole
earth. 'Song of Myself' (1855) st. 32

Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity, When I give I give
myself. 'Song of Myself' (1855) st. 39

My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain, The Lord will be there and
wait till I come on perfect terms, The great Camerado, the lover true
for whom I pine will be there. 'Song of Myself' (1855) st. 45

I have said that the soul is not more than the body, And I have said
that the body is not more than the soul, And nothing, not God, is
greater to one than one's self is. 'Song of Myself' (1855) st. 48

In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the
glass, I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is
signed by God's name, And I leave them where they are, for I know that
wheresoe'er I go, Others will punctually come for ever and ever. 'Song
of Myself' (1855) st. 48

Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself, (I am large,
I contain multitudes.) 'Song of Myself' (1855) st. 51

Where the populace rise at once against the never-ending audacity of
elected persons. 'Song of the Broad Axe' 5, l. 12

Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same as the
men, Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as
the men; Where the city of the faithfullest friends stands, Where the
city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands, Where the city of the
healthiest fathers stands, Where the city of the best-bodied mothers
stands, There the great city stands. 'Song of the Broad Axe' 5, l. 20

Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road, Healthy, free, the
world before me, The long brown path before me leading wherever I
choose. 'Song of the Open Road' 1, l. 1

The earth, that is sufficient, I do not want the constellations any
nearer, I know they are very well where they are, I know they suffice
for those who belong to them. 'Song of the Open Road' 1, l. 8

When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed, And the great star early
drooped in the western sky in the night, I mourned, and yet shall mourn
with ever-returning spring. 'When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed'
st. 1

Come lovely and soothing death, Undulate round the world, serenely
arriving, arriving, In the day, in the night, to all, to each, Sooner or
later, delicate death. Praised be the fathomless universe, For life and
joy, and for objects and knowledge curious, And for love, sweet
love---but praise! praise! praise! For the sure-enwinding arms of
cool-enfolding death. 'When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed' st. 14

No publisher should ever express an opinion of the value of what he
publishes. That is a matter entirely for the literary critic to

believed him. For them, 5th September---the day that the Trades Union
Congress unanimously rejected the policy of wage restraint---marked the
end of an era. And all these financiers, all the little gnomes in Zurich
and the other financial centres about whom we keep on hearing, started

Harold Wilson...was unable to remember when he first uttered his dictum
to the effect that: A week is a long time in politics....Inquiries among
political journalists led to the conclusion that in its present form the
phrase was probably first uttered at a meeting between Wilson and the
Parliamentary lobby in the wake of the Sterling crisis shortly after he
first took office as Prime Minister in 1964. However, Robert
Carvel...recalled Wilson at a Labour Party conference in 1960 saying
'Forty-eight hours is a long time in politics.' In Nigel Rees 'Sayings

11.108 Woodrow Wilson 1856-1924 Liberty has never come from the
government. Liberty has always come from the subjects of government. The
history of liberty is the history of resistance. The history of liberty

when Aunt is calling to Aunt like mastodons bellowing across primeval

is being shot round the family circle ('Please read this carefully and
send it on to Jane'), the clan has a tendency to ignore me. It's one of

we agree with the lady's maid that high birth is a form of congenital

11.133 Dorothy Wordsworth 1771-1855 When we were in the woods beyond
Gowbarrow park we saw a few daffodils close to the waterside...But as we
went along there were more and yet more and at last under the boughs of
the trees, we saw that there was a long belt of them along the shore,
about the breadth of a country turnpike road. I never saw daffodils so
beautiful they grew among the mossy stones about and about them, some
rested their heads upon these stones as on pillow for weariness and the
rest tossed and reeled and danced and seemed as if they verily laughed
with the wind that blew upon them over the lake. 'The Grasmere Journals'

11.134 Elizabeth Wordsworth 1840-1932 If all the good people were

clever, The clever so rude to the good! 'Good and Clever'

Action is transitory,---a step, a blow, The motion of a muscle, this way

like men betrayed: Suffering is permanent, obscure and dark, And shares
the nature of infinity. 'The Borderers' (1842) act 3, l. 1539

Who is the happy Warrior? Who is he That every man in arms should wish
to be? It is the generous spirit, who, when brought Among the tasks of
real life, hath wrought Upon the plan that pleased his childish thought:
Whose high endeavours are an inward light That makes the path before him
always bright: Who, with a natural instinct to discern What knowledge
can perform, is diligent to learn. 'Character of the Happy Warrior'
(1807)

Earth has not anything to show more fair; Dull would he be of soul who
could pass by A sight so touching in its majesty: This City now doth,
like a garment, wear The beauty of the morning; silent, bare, Ships,
towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie Open unto the fields, and to
the sky; All bright and glittering in the smokeless air. 'Composed upon
Westminster Bridge' (1807)

Dear God! the very houses seem asleep; And all that mighty heart is
lying still! 'Composed upon Westminster Bridge' (1807)

I have seen A curious child, who dwelt upon a tract Of inland ground
applying to his ear The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell; To which,
in silence hushed, his very soul Listened intensely; and his countenance
soon Brightened with joy; for from within were heard Murmurings, whereby
the monitor expressed Mysterious union with its native sea. 'The
Excursion' (1814) bk. 4, l. 1132

It is a beauteous evening, calm and free, The holy time is quiet as a
nun, Breathless with adoration. 'It is a beauteous evening' (1807)

Dear Child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here If thou appear
untouched by solemn thought, Thy nature is not therefore less divine.
Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year; And worshipp'st at the
temple's inner shrine, God being with thee when we know it not. 'It is a
beauteous evening' (1807)

It is not to be thought of that the Flood Of British freedom, which, to
the open sea Of the world's praise, from dark antiquity Hath flowed,
'with pomp of waters, unwithstood'... Should perish. 'It is not to be
thought of' (1807)

In our halls is hung

Armoury of the invincible Knights of old: We must be free or die, who
speak the tongue That Shakespeare spake; the faith and morals hold Which
Milton held.---In everything we are sprung Of Earth's first blood, have
titles manifold. 'It is not to be thought of' (1807)

I travelled among unknown men In lands beyond the sea; Nor, England! did
I know till then What love I bore to thee. 'I travelled among unknown
men' (1807)

I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the
lake, beneath the trees, Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. 'I
wandered lonely as a cloud' (1807).

A poet could not but be gay, In such a jocund company: I gazed---and
gazed---but little thought What wealth to me the show had brought: For
oft, when on my couch I lie In vacant or in pensive mood, They flash
upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart
with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils. 'I wandered lonely
as a cloud' (1807)

Jones! as from Calais southward you and I Went pacing side by side, this
public Way Streamed with the pomp of a too-credulous day. 'Jones! as

The gods approve The depth, and not the tumult, of the soul. 'Laodamia'
(1815) l. 74

Of all that is most beauteous---imaged there In happier beauty; more
pellucid streams, An ampler ether, a diviner air, And fields invested
with purpureal gleams.

'Laodamia' (1815) l. 103

I have owed to them, In hours of weariness, sensations sweet, Felt in
the blood, and felt along the heart; And passing even into my purer
mind, With tranquil restoration:---feelings too Of unremembered
pleasure: such, perhaps, As have no slight or trivial influence On that
best portion of a good man's life, His little, nameless, unremembered,
acts Of kindness and of love. 'Lines composed a few miles above Tintern
Abbey' (1798) l. 26

That blessed mood, In which the burthen of the mystery, In which the
heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world, Is
lightened. 'Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey' (1798) l. 37

For nature then (The coarser pleasures of my boyish days, And their glad
animal movements all gone by) To me was all in all.---I cannot paint
What then I was. The sounding cataract Haunted me like a passion: the
tall rock, The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, Their colours and
their forms, were then to me An appetite; a feeling and a love, That had
no need of a remoter charm, By thought supplied, nor any interest
Unborrowed from the eye. 'Lines composed a few miles above Tintern
Abbey' (1798) l. 72

I have learned To look on nature, not as in the hour Of thoughtless
youth; but hearing often-times The still, sad music of humanity, Nor
harsh nor grating, though of ample power To chasten and subdue. And I
have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts;
a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused,

Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean and the
living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man. 'Lines composed a
few miles above Tintern Abbey' (1798) l. 88

A power is passing from the earth To breathless Nature's dark abyss; But
when the great and good depart, What is it more than this--- That Man
who is from God sent forth, Doth yet again to God return?--- Such ebb
and flow must ever be, Then wherefore should we mourn? 'Lines on the
Expected Dissolution of Mr Fox' (1807)

And much it grieved my heart to think What man has made of man. 'Lines
Written in Early Spring' (1798)

I chanced to see at break of day The solitary child. 'Lucy Gray' (1800)

The good old rule Sufficeth them, the simple plan, That they should
take, who have the power, And they should keep who can. 'Rob Roy's
Grave' from 'Memorials of a Tour in Scotland, 1803'

Behold her, single in the field, Yon solitary Highland lass! 'The
Solitary Reaper' from 'Memorials of a Tour in Scotland, 1803'

Will no one tell me what she sings?--- Perhaps the plaintive numbers
flow For old, unhappy, far-off things, And battles long ago. 'The
Solitary Reaper' from 'Memorials of a Tour in Scotland, 1803'

Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain That has been, and may be again. 'The
Solitary Reaper' from 'Memorials of a Tour in Scotland, 1803'

The music in my heart I bore, Long after it was heard no more. 'The
Solitary Reaper' from 'Memorials of a Tour in Scotland, 1803'

Degenerate Douglas! Oh, the unworthy lord! 'Sonnet' from 'Memorials of a
Tour in Scotland, 1803'

What, you are stepping westward? 'Stepping Westward' from 'Memorials of
a Tour in Scotland, 1803'

Sweet Highland Girl, a very shower Of beauty is thy earthly dower. 'To a
Highland Girl' from 'Memorials of a Tour in Scotland, 1803'

Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour: England hath need of thee;
she is a fen Of stagnant waters: altar, sword, and pen, Fireside, the
heroic wealth of hall and bower, Have forfeited their ancient English
dower Of inward happiness. 'Milton! thou shouldst' (1807)

Some happy tone Of meditation, slipping in between The beauty coming and
the beauty gone. 'Most sweet it is' (1835)

My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky: So was it when my
life began; So is it now I am a man; So be it when I shall grow old, Or
let me die! The Child is fatehr of the Man; And I could wish my days to
be Bound each to each by natural piety. 'My heart leaps up' (1807)

Nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room; And hermits are contented
with their cells. 'Nuns fret not' (1807)

In sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound Within the Sonnet's scanty
plot of ground; Pleased if some souls (for such there needs must be) Who
have felt the weight of too much liberty, Should find some solace there,
as I have found. 'Nuns fret not' (1807)

Move along these shades In gentleness of heart; with gentle hand
Touch---for there is a spirit in the woods. 'Nutting' (1800)

But Thy most dreaded instrument

In working out a pure intent, Is man,---arrayed for mutual slaughter,
Yea, Carnage is Thy daughter. 'Ode, 1815' (Imagination---ne'er before
content, 1816)

There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream, The earth, and every
common sight, To me did seem Apparelled in celestial light, The glory
and the freshness of a dream. It is not now as it hath been of yore;---
Turn wheresoe'er I may, By night or day, The things which I have seen I
now can see no more. The rainbow comes and goes, And lovely is the rose,
The moon doth with delight Look round her when the heavens are bare,
Waters on a starry night Are beautiful and fair; The sunshine is a
glorious birth: But yet I know, where'er I go, That there hath passed
away a glory from the earth. 'Ode. Intimations of Immortality' (1807)
st. 1

A timely utterance gave that thought relief, And I again am strong.
'Ode. Intimations of Immortality' (1807) st. 3

The winds come to me from the fields of sleep. 'Ode. Intimations of
Immortality' (1807) st. 3

Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy. 'Ode.
Intimations of Immortality' (1807) st. 3

The sun shines warm, And the Babe leaps up on his Mother's arm. 'Ode.
Intimations of Immortality' (1807) st. 4

---But there's a tree of many, one, A single field which I have looked
upon, Both of them speak of something that is gone: The pansy at my feet
Doth the same tale repeat: Whither is fled the visionary gleam? Where is
it now, the glory and the dream?

Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting: The Soul that rises with us,
our life's Star, Hath had elsewhere its setting, And cometh from afar;
Not in entire forgetfulness, And not in utter nakedness, But trailing
clouds of glory do we come From God, who is our home: Heaven lies about
us in our infancy! Shades of the prison-house begin to close Upon the
growing boy, But he beholds the light, and whence it flows, He sees it
in his joy; The youth, who daily farther from the east Must travel,
still is Nature's priest, And by the vision splendid Is on his way
attended; At length the man perceives it die away, And fade into the
light of common day. 'Ode. Intimations of Immortality' (1807) st. 4

As if his whole vocation Were endless imitation. 'Ode. Intimations of
Immortality' (1807) st. 7

Thou Eye among the blind, That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal
deep Haunted for ever by the eternal mind. 'Ode. Intimations of
Immortality' (1807) st. 8

Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke The years to bring the
inevitable yoke, Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife? Full soon
thy Soul shall have her earthly freight, And custom lie upon thee with a
weight, Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life! 'Ode. Intimations of
Immortality' (1807) st. 8

O joy! that in our embers Is something that doth live, That nature yet
remembers What was so fugitive! The thought of our past years in me doth
breed Perpetual benediction.

'Ode. Intimations of Immortality' (1807) st. 9

Not for these I raise The song of thanks and praise; But for those
obstinate questionings Of sense and outward things, Fallings from us,
vanishings; Blank misgivings of a creature Moving about in worlds not
realised, High instincts before which our mortal nature Did tremble like
a guilty thing suprised. 'Ode. Intimations of Immortality' (1807) st. 9

Our noisy years seem moments in the being Of the eternal Silence: truths
that wake, To perish never. 'Ode. Intimations of Immortality' (1807) st.
9

Hence in a season of calm weather Though inland far we be, Our souls
have sight of that immortal sea Which brought us hither, Can in a moment
travel thither, And see the children sport upon the shore, And hear the
mighty waters rolling evermore. 'Ode. Intimations of Immortality' (1807)
st. 9

Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendour in the grass, of
glory in the flower; We will grieve not, rather find Strength in what
remains behind... In the faith that looks through death, In years that
bring the philosophic mind. And O, ye fountains, meadows, hills and
groves, Forbode not any severing of our loves! Yet in my heart of hearts
I feel your might; I only have relinquished one delight To live beneath
your more habitual sway. 'Ode. Intimations of Immortality' (1807) st. 10

Another race hath been, and other palms are won. Thanks to the human
heart by which we live, Thanks to its tenderness, its joys and fears, To
me the meanest flower that blows can give Thoughts that do often lie too
deep for tears.

'Ode. Intimations of Immortality' (1807) st. 11

Stern daughter of the voice of God! O Duty! if that name thou love Who
art a light to guide, a rod To check the erring and reprove. 'Ode to
Duty' (1807)

Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong; And the most ancient heavens,
through Thee, are fresh and strong. 'Ode to Duty' (1807)

Plain living and high thinking are no more: The homely beauty of the
good old cause Is gone; our peace, our fearful innocence, And pure
religion breathing household laws. 'O friend! I know not' (1807)

Once did she hold the gorgeous East in fee, And was the safeguard of the
West. 'Once did she hold'

Venice, the eldest Child of Liberty. She was a maiden City, bright and
free. 'Once did she hold'

Sweetest melodies Are those by distance made more sweet. 'Personal Talk'

There's something in a flying horse, There's something in a huge
balloon; But through the clouds I'll never float Until I have a little
Boat, Shaped like the crescent moon. 'Peter Bell' (1819) prologue, l. 1

A primrose by a river's brim A yellow primrose was to him, And it was
nothing more. 'Peter Bell' (1819) pt. 1, l. 249

He gave a groan, and then another, Of that which went before the
brother, And then he gave a third. 'Peter Bell' (1819) pt. 1, l. 443

Is it a party in a parlour?

Crammed just as they on earth were crammed--- Some sipping punch, some
sipping tea, But, as you by their faces see, All silent and all damned!
'Peter Bell' pt. 1, st. 66 in MS of 1819, later omitted

A Poet!---He hath put his heart to school, Nor dares to move unpropped
upon the staff Which Art hath lodged within his hand---must laugh By
precept only, and shed tears by rule. 'A Poet! He hath put his heart'
(1842)

Physician art thou?---one, all eyes, Philosopher!---a fingering slave,
One that would peep and botanize Upon his mother's grave? 'A Poet's
Epitaph' (1800)

A reasoning, self-sufficing thing, An intellectual All-in-all! 'A Poet's
Epitaph' (1800)

In common things that round us lie Some random truths he can impart,---
The harvest of a quiet eye, That broods and sleeps on his own heart. But
he is weak; both Man and Boy, Hath been an idler in the land; Contented
if he might enjoy The things which others understand. ---Come hither in
thy hour of strength; Come, weak as is a breaking wave. 'A Poet's
Epitaph' (1800)

I recoil and droop, and seek repose In listlessness from vain
perplexity, Unprofitably travelling toward the grave. 'The Prelude'
(1850) bk. 1, l. 265

Made one long bathing of a summer's day. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 1, l.

Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up Fostered alike by beauty and
by fear. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 1, l. 301

When the deed was done

I heard among the solitary hills Low breathings coming after me, and
sounds Of undistinguishable motion, steps Almost as silent as the turf
they trod. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 1, l. 321

Though mean Our object and inglorious, yet the end Was not ignoble. 'The
Prelude' (1850) bk. 1, l. 328

Dust as we are, the immortal spirit grows Like harmony in music; there
is a dark Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles Discordant elements,
makes them cling together In one society. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 1, l.
340

The grim shape Towered up between me and the stars, and still, For so it
seemed, with purpose of its own And measured motion like a living thing,
Strode after me. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 1, l. 382

For many days, my brain Worked with a dim and undetermined sense Of
unknown modes of being. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 1, l. 391

Huge and mighty forms that do not live Like living men, moved slowly
through the mind By day, and were a trouble to my dreams. 'The Prelude'
(1850) bk. 1, l. 398

I was taught to feel, perhaps too much, The self-sufficing power of
Solitude. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 2, l. 76

To thee Science appears but, what in truth she is, Not as our glory and
our absolute boast, But as a succedaneum, and a prop To our infirmity.
'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 2, l. 211

Where the statue stood Of Newton, with his prism and silent face,

The marble index of a mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of
Thought, alone. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 3, l. 61

Spirits overwrought Were making night do penance for a day Spent in a
round of strenuous idleness. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 4, l. 376

Even forms and substances are circumfused By that transparent veil with
light divine, And, through the turnings intricate of verse, Present
themselves as objects recognised, In flashes, and with glory not their
own. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 5, l. 601

We were brothers all In honour, as in one community, Scholars and
gentlemen. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 9, l. 227

Not in Utopia---subterranean fields,--- Or some secreted island, Heaven
knows where! But in the very world, which is the world Of all of
us,---the place where, in the end We find our happiness, or not at all!

There is One great society alone on earth: The noble Living and the
noble Dead. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 11, l. 393

presence stood, as now I stand, A sensitive being, a creative soul. 'The
Prelude' (1850) bk. 12, l. 204

Imagination, which, in truth, Is but another name for absolute power

And clearest insight, amplitude of mind, And Reason in her most exalted
mood. 'The Prelude' (1850) bk. 14, l. 190

There was a roaring in the wind all night; The rain came heavily and
fell in floods; But now the sun is rising, calm and bright. 'Resolution
and Independence' (1807) st. 1

I thought of Chatterton, the marvellous boy, The sleepless soul, that
perished in his pride; Of him who walked in glory and in joy, Following
his plough, along the mountain side: By our own spirits are we deified:
We poets in our youth begin in gladness; But thereof comes in the end
despondency and madness. 'Resolution and Independence' (1807) st. 7

His words came feebly, from a feeble chest, But each in solemn order
followed each, With something of a lofty utterance drest--- Choice
words, and measured phrase, above the reach Of ordinary men; a stately
speech; Such as grave Livers do in Scotland use. 'Resolution and
Independence' (1807) st. 14

The fear that kills; And hope that is unwilling to be fed; Cold, pain,
and labour, and all fleshly ills; And mighty Poets in their misery dead.
---Perplexed, and longing to be comforted, My question eagerly I did
renew. 'How is it that you live, and what is it you do?' 'Resolution and
Independence' (1807) st. 17

At the corner of Wood Street, when daylight appears, Hangs a thrush that
sings loud, it has sung for three years: Poor Susan has passed by the
spot, and has heard In the silence of morning the song of the bird. 'Tis
a note of enchantment; what ails her? She sees A mountain ascending, a
vision of trees; Bright volumes of vapour through Lothbury glide, And a
river flows on through the vale of Cheapside. 'The Reverie of Poor
Susan'

I thought of Thee, my partner and my guide,

As being past away---Vain sympathies! For, backward, Duddon! as I cast
my eyes, I see what was, and is, and will abide; Still glides the
Stream, and shall for ever glide; The Form remains, the Function never
dies. 'The River Duddon' (1820) st. 34 'After-Thought'

Enough, if something from our hands have power To live, and act, and
serve the future hour; And if, as toward the silent tomb we go, Through
love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower, We feel that we are
greater than we know. 'The River Duddon' (1820) st. 34 'After-Thought'

Scorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frowned, Mindless of its just
honours; with this key Shakespeare unlocked his heart. 'Scorn not the
Sonnet' (1827)

She dwelt among the untrodden ways Beside the springs of Dove, A maid
whom there were none to praise And very few to love: A violet by a mossy
stone Half hidden from the eye! Fair as a star, when only one Is shining
in the sky. She lived unknown, and few could know When Lucy ceased to
be; But she is in her grave, and, oh, The difference to me! 'She dwelt
among the untrodden ways' (1800)

She was a phantom of delight When first she gleamed upon my sight. 'She
was a phantom of delight' (1807)

I saw her upon nearer view, A spirit, yet a woman too! Her household
motions light and free, And steps of virgin liberty; A countenance in
which did meet Sweet records, promises as sweet; A creature not too
bright or good For human nature's daily food;

For transient sorrows, simple wiles, Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears,
and smiles. And now I see with eye serene, The very pulse of the
machine; A being breathing thoughtful breath, A traveller betwixt life
and death; The reason firm, the temperate will, Endurance, foresight,
strength, and skill; A perfect woman, nobly planned, To warn, to
comfort, and command; And yet a spirit still, and bright With something
of angelic light. 'She was a phantom of delight' (1807)

For still, the more he works, the more Do his weak ankles swell. 'Simon
Lee' (1798)

A slumber did my spirit seal; I had no human fears: She seemed a thing
that could not feel The touch of earthly years. No motion has she now,
no force; She neither hears nor sees; Rolled round in earth's diurnal
course, With rocks, and stones, and trees. 'A slumber did my spirit
seal' (1800)

Love had he found in huts where poor men lie; His daily teachers had
been woods and rills, The silence that is in the starry sky, The sleep
that is among the lonely hills. 'Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle'
(1807)

O Man, that from thy fair and shining youth Age might but take the
things Youth needed not! 'The Small Celandine' (There is a flower, 1807)

What fond and wayward thoughts will slide Into a Lover's head! 'O
mercy!' to myself I cried, 'If Lucy should be dead!' 'Strange Fits of
Passion' (1800)

Surprised by joy---impatient as the Wind I turned to share the
transport---Oh! with whom

But Thee, deep buried in the silent tomb. 'Surprised by joy' (1815)

Up! up! my friend, and quit your books; Or surely you'll grow double.
'The Tables Turned' (1798)

Our meddling intellect Misshapes the beauteous forms of things:--- We
murder to dissect. Enough of science and of art; Close up these barren
leaves. Come forth, and bring with you a heart That watches and
receives. 'The Tables Turned' (1798)

Tax not the royal Saint with vain expense, With ill-matched aims the
Architect who planned--- Albeit labouring for a scanty band Of
white-robed Scholars only---this immense And glorious work of fine
intelligence! Give all thou canst; high Heaven rejects the lore Of
nicely-calculated less or more. 'Tax not the royal Saint' (1822)
(referring to King's College Chapel, Cambridge)

I've measured it from side to side: 'Tis three feet long and two feet
wide. 'The Thorn' (1798) st. 3 (early reading)

O blithe new-comer! I have heard, I hear thee and rejoice. O Cuckoo!
Shall I call thee bird, Or but a wandering voice? 'To the Cuckoo' (O
blithe new-comer!, 1807)

Oft on the dappled turf at ease I sit, and play with similes, Loose
types of things through all degrees. 'To the Same Flower \[Daisy\]'
(With little here to do, 1807)

Type of the wise who soar, but never roam; True to the kindred points of
heaven and home! 'To a Skylark' (Ethereal minstrel!, 1827)

There's a flower that shall be mine, 'Tis the little celandine. 'To the
Small Celandine' (Pansies, lilies, 1807)

Spade! with which Wilkinson hath tilled his lands,

And shaped these pleasant walks by Emont's side, Thou art a tool of
honour in my hands; I press thee, through the yielding soil, with pride.
'To the Spade of a Friend' (1807)

But an old age, serene and bright, And lovely as a Lapland night, Shall
lead thee to thy grave. 'To a Young Lady' (1802)

Though fallen thyself, never to rise again, Live, and take comfort. Thou
hast left behind Powers that will work for thee; air, earth, and skies;
There's not a breathing of the common wind That will forget thee; thou
hast great allies; Thy friends are exultations, agonies, And love, and
man's unconquerable mind. 'Toussaint, the most unhappy man' (1803)

Two Voices are there; one is of the sea, One of the mountains; each a
mighty Voice, In both from age to age thou didst rejoice, They were thy
chosen music, Liberty! 'Two Voices are there' (1807)

A simple child, dear brother Jim That lightly draws its breath, And
feels its life in every limb, What should it know of death? 'We are
Seven' (1798) (the words 'dear brother Jim' were omitted in the 1815
edition of his poems)

I take my little porringer And eat my supper there. 'We are Seven'
(1798)

'But they are dead; those two are dead! Their spirits are in Heaven!'
'Twas throwing words away; for still The little Maid would have her
will, And said, 'Nay, we are seven!' 'We are Seven' (1798)

The world is too much with us; late and soon, Getting and spending, we
lay waste our powers: Little we see in Nature that is ours. 'The world
is too much with us' (1807)

Great God! I'd rather be

A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn, So might I, standing on this
pleasant lea, Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; Have sight
of Proteus rising from the sea, Or hear old Triton blow his wreathéd
horn. 'The world is too much with us' (1807).

The Poet writes under one restriction only, namely, that of the
necessity of giving pleasure to a human Being possessed of that
information which may be expected from him, not as a lawyer, a
physician, a mariner, an astronomer or a natural philosopher, but as a
Man. 'Lyrical Ballads' (2nd ed., 1802) preface

Poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge; it is the
impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all science.
'Lyrical Ballads' (2nd ed., 1802) preface

Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its
origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity. 'Lyrical Ballads' (2nd
ed., 1802) preface

simple truth his utmost skill! 'The Character of a Happy Life'

Who God doth late and early pray More of his grace than gifts to lend;
And entertains the harmless day With a religious book, or friend. This

Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths, Enwrought with golden and silver
light, The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and

Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. 'Aedh Wishes for the Cloths

Wore it in the world's eye As though they'd wrought it. Song, let them
take it For there's more enterprise In walking naked. 'A Coat'

We were the last romantics---chose for theme Traditional sanctity and
loveliness; Whatever's written in what poets name The book of the
people; whatever most can bless The mind of man or elevate a rhyme; But
all is changed, that high horse riderless, Though mounted in that saddle
Homer rode Where the swan drifts upon a darkening flood. 'Coole and
Ballylee, 1931'

Down by the salley gardens my love and I did meet; She passed the salley
gardens with little snow-white feet. She bid me take love easy, as the
leaves grow on the tree; But I, being young and foolish, with her would
not agree. In a field by the river my love and I did stand, And on my
leaning shoulder she laid her snow-white hand. She bid me take life
easy, as the grass grows on the weirs; But I was young and foolish, and
now am full of tears. 'Down by the Salley Gardens'

I have met them at close of day Coming with vivid faces From counter or
desk among grey Eighteenth-century houses. I have passed with a nod of
the head Or polite meaningless words, Or have lingered awhile and said
Polite meaningless words, And thought before I had done Of a mocking
tale or a gibe To please a companion Around the fire at the club, Being
certain that they and I But lived where motley is worn: All changed,
changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born. 'Easter, 1916'

Too long a sacrifice Can make a stone of the heart. O when may it
suffice? 'Easter, 1916'

I write it out in a verse--- MacDonagh and MacBride And Connolly and
Pearse Now and in time to be,

Wherever green is worn, Are changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty
is born. 'Easter, 1916'

I see a schoolboy when I think of him With face and nose pressed to a
sweet-shop window, For certainly he sank into his grave His senses and
his heart unsatisfied, And made---being poor, ailing and ignorant, Shut
out from all the luxury of the world, The ill-bred son of a livery
stable-keeper--- Luxuriant song. 'Ego Dominus Tuus' (referring to Keats)

The fascination of what's difficult Has dried the sap out of my veins,
and rent Spontaneous joy and natural content Out of my heart. 'The

Never to have lived is best, ancient writers say; Never to have drawn

Out-worn heart, in a time out-worn, Come clear of the nets of wrong and
right; Laugh, heart, again in the gray twilight; Sigh, heart, again in
the dew of morn.

'Into the Twilight'

Nor law, nor duty bade me fight, Nor public man, nor angry crowds, A
lonely impulse of delight Drove to this tumult in the clouds; I balanced
all, brought all to mind, The years to come seemed waste of breath, A
waste of breath the years behind In balance with this life, this death.
'An Irish Airman Foresees his Death'

I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree, And a small cabin build
there, of clay and wattles made; Nine bean rows will I have there, a
hive for the honey bee, And live alone in the bee-loud glade. And I
shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow, Dropping
from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings; There
midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow, And evening full of
the linnet's wings. I will arise and go now, for always night and day I
hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore; While I stand on
the roadway or on the pavements gray, I hear it in the deep heart's
core. 'The Lake Isle of Innisfree'

A sudden blow: the great wings beating still Above the staggering girl,
her thighs caressed By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill, He

A shudder in the loins engenders there The broken wall, the burning roof

I think it better that at times like these We poets keep our mouths
shut, for in truth We have no gift to set a statesman right; He's had
enough of meddling who can please A young girl in the indolence of her

That is no country for old men. The young In one another's arms, birds

music all neglect Monuments of unageing intellect. 'Sailing to

Turning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the
falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is
loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction,
while the worst Are full of passionate intensity. 'The Second Coming'

The darkness drops again but now I know That twenty centuries of stony
sleep Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, And what rough beast,
its hour come round at last, Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? 'The
Second Coming'

Was it for this the wild geese spread The grey wing upon every tide; For
this that all that blood was shed, For this Edward Fitzgerald died, And
Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone, All that delirium of the brave; Romantic
Ireland's dead and gone, It's with O'Leary in the grave. 'September,

Pythagoras planned it. Why did the people stare? His numbers, though
they moved or seemed to move In marble or in bronze, lacked character.
But boys and girls, pale from the imagined love Of solitary beds, knew
what they were, That passion could bring character enough, And pressed
at midnight in some public place Live lips upon a plummet-measured face.
No! Greater than Pythagoras, for the men That with a mallet or a chisel
modelled these Calculations that look but casual flesh, put down All
Asiatic vague immensities, And not the banks of oars that swam upon The
many-headed foam at Salamis. Europe put off that foam when Phidias Gave
women dreams and dreams their looking glass. 'The Statues'

When Pearse summoned Cuchulain to his side What stalked through the Post
Office? What intellect, What calculation, number, measurement, replied?
We Irish, born into that ancient sect But thrown upon this filthy modern
tide And by its formless spawning, fury wrecked, Climb to our proper
dark, that we may trace The lineaments of a plummet-measured face. 'The
Statues'

Swift has sailed into his rest; Savage indignation there Cannot lacerate
his breast. Imitate him if you dare,

World-besotted traveller; he Served human liberty. 'Swift's Epitaph'.

But where's the wild dog that has praised his fleas? 'To a Poet, Who
would have Me Praise certain bad Poets, Imitators of His and of Mine'

Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days! Come near me, while I
sing the ancient ways. 'To the Rose upon the Rood of Time'

A woman of so shining loveliness That men threshed corn at midnight by a
tress, A little stolen tress. 'To the Secret Rose'

When shall the stars be blown about the sky, Like the sparks blown out
of a smithy, and die? Surely thine hour has come, thy great wind blows,
Far off, most secret, and inviolate Rose? 'To the Secret Rose'

Does the imagination dwell the most Upon a woman won or woman lost? If
on the lost, admit you turned aside From a great labyrinth out of pride.
'The Tower' pt. 2

Measurement began our might: Forms a stark Egyptian thought, Forms that
gentler Phidias wrought. Michaelangelo left a proof On the Sistine
Chapel roof, Where but half-awakened Adam Can disturb globe-trotting
Madam Till her bowels are in heat, Proof that there's a purpose set
Before the secret working mind: Profane perfection of mankind. 'Under
Ben Bulben' pt. 4

Irish poets, learn your trade, Sing whatever is well made, Scorn the
sort now growing up All out of shape from toe to top, Their
unremembering hearts and heads Base-born products of base beds.

Sing the peasantry, and then Hard-riding country gentlemen, The holiness
of monks, and after Porter-drinkers' randy laughter. 'Under Ben Bulben'
pt. 5

Cast your mind on other days That we in coming days may be Still the
indomitable Irishry. 'Under Ben Bulben' pt. 5

Under bare Ben Bulben's head In Drumcliffe churchyard Yeats is laid. An
ancestor was rector there Long years ago, a church stands near, By the
road an ancient cross. No marble, no conventional phrase; On limestone
quarried near the spot By his command these words are cut: Cast a cold
eye On life, on death. Horseman pass by! 'Under Ben Bulben' pt. 6

While on the shop and street I gazed My body of a sudden blazed; And
twenty minutes more or less It seemed, so great my happiness, That I was
blesséd and could bless. 'Vacillation'

When you are old and grey and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire,
take down this book And slowly read and dream of the soft look Your eyes
had once, and of their shadows deep. How many loved your moments of glad
grace, And loved your beauty with love false or true, But one man loved
the pilgrim soul in you, And loved the sorrows of your changing face.
And bending down beside the glowing bars Murmur, a little sad, 'From us
fled Love. He paced upon the mountains far above, And hid his face amid
a crowd of stars.' 'When You Are Old'

What lively lad most pleasured me Of all that with me lay? I answer that
I gave my soul And loved in misery, But had great pleasure with a lad
That I loved bodily. Flinging from his arms I laughed To think his
passion such He fancied that I gave a soul Did but our bodies touch, And
laughed upon his breast to think Beast gave beast as much. 'A Woman
Young and Old' pt. 9
