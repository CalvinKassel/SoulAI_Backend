Strength of Individual Traits 

13 COMMENTS 

Upon completing our personality test, you will receive a list of five scales, each one with a value in percentages. You may wonder what those mean. 

Here is a quick guide. 

These percentages show how strongly your test responses support a particular personality trait when compared with its opposite trait. The five trait pairs include: 

Mind – Introverted or Extraverted 

Energy – Intuitive or Observant 

Nature – Thinking or Feeling 

Tactics – Judging or Prospecting 

Identity – Assertive or Turbulent 

It’s important to remember that this scale is not a comparison to other people. It’s all about you and your answers to the test. Scoring “65% Extraverted” on the scale does not mean that you are more Extraverted than 65% of all test takers. The percentages are based on your answers, alone, as an individual. 

The two opposing poles of each of the five scales represent endorsing 100% of the statements for each trait. For example, using the Mind scale, one end would be “100% Introverted” and, at the other end, “100% Extraverted.”

The midpoint between the two opposing traits in the pair is 50%. The percentage values show your position on all five scales – the higher the percentage, the stronger you likely express the trait on the side of the high percentage. The closer the score is to 50%, the weaker the trait. Theoretically, and for purposes of illustration, if the score passes below 50% for one trait, it starts increasing the percentage and describing the strength of the other trait in the pair. 

**6 5%** 

**Int rov e rted** 

**35 %** 

**Ext rave rted** 

If you score “65% Introverted,” theoretically, you could reverse the scale by subtracting 65% from 100% to show that you endorsed about 35% of the statements for Extraversion. Scoring “35% Extraverted” will not affect your five letter personality type. You’re still an Introvert. But there may be some useful information in knowing the amount of influence the opposite trait might exert on your personality. There will likely be some differences between people who score “10% Extraverted” and “45% Extraverted.” For a more refined look at where you land on the trait scales, we suggest you visit the Trait Scholar tool. 

While your main expression of the trait rests on the side with the highest percentage, you may still express enough of the other trait to take on some characteristics that are not typically a part of your type profile in its purest form. For instance, a very Extraverted person may, on occasion, read a book rather than go to a party. Or a very Introverted person may feel compelled to publicly voice their opinion at a rally instead of staying quietly at home.

Adaptation is also a factor to consider. No personality is immune to outside influences. We all adapt to survive in the world. After a while, our adaptive behaviors can become a habit and seem like a “natural” part of our personality. So, in that one area, you may not fit the profile exactly because you’ve adapted to something different. But again, you’re likely to find that most of the profile remains an accurate description of your personality. 

For these reasons, you may find that sometimes, when reading a description of your personality type or trait, you may not feel that it applies to you. That’s fine. It would probably be unusual if you didn’t occasionally find something that doesn’t fit. 

People who answer 100% of a trait’s statements positively are rare indeed. Similarly, less than 100% alignment with the characteristics described in your profile doesn’t mean that you’re not the type or trait you’re reading about. It just means that there is room for balance – and your personality has space for more than just the specialized characteristics of a single trait. You still belong to the same club. And you’re likely to find that, for the most part, the rest of the profile fits with remarkable precision. For a more thorough picture of the way your traits balance, visit the Trait Scholar tool. 

Which trait should you claim if it’s somewhere between 55% and 50% and so close to the divide between the two traits? You’ll find some guidance on how to handle that in our Core Theory article, “Unsure About Your Personality Type?”

ROMANCE 

How to Ask Out an Advocate (INFJ) 

LAURA 51 COMMENTS 

So you want to ask an Advocate (INFJ) out on a date – are you sure about that? Just kidding: Advocates are known for being caring and compassionate, and they’re always looking for ways to support and uplift other people. This may be a rare personality type, but it’s one that leaves the world a better place. 

Make no mistake, however – Advocates are 

kind, but they can be downright choosy. 

People with this personality type tend to 

have dreamed up clear ideals of what 

they’re looking for in a partner and a 

relationship. Those ideals can be quite lofty 

– and surprisingly specific. So if an 

Advocate turns you down, respect their 

decision, but try not to take it too 

personally. 

The good news is that, with a little know 

how, you can ask out that super-special 

Advocate in a way that’s more likely to 

resonate with them. What we’re offering 

here isn’t a guaranteed recipe for success, nor is it some kind of personality based manipulation tactic. It’s just a few guiding insights about what matters to Advocates in romance and in life – and about what gets on their nerves. 

©20112025 NERIS Analytics Limited. https://www.16personalities.com   
16/07/2025, 18:50 How to Ask Out an Advocate (INFJ) | 16PersonalitiesSo without further ado, here are our top tips for asking someone with the Advocate personality type out on a date. 

Tip \#1: Don’t Invade Their Privacy 

Advocates may be kind and friendly, but they’re not open books. In fact, they can be quite private. When someone with this personality type chooses to open up, they do so on their own terms – and in their own time. If you push too hard, chances are they’ll just clam up. 

Ideally, you’d want to take some time to establish familiarity with an Advocate before asking them out. Some personality types are flattered by the whole “I saw you across the room and couldn’t resist” thing, but that tactic rarely works with Advocates. People with this personality type want to be appreciated for who they are and not just how they look. And they can find it challenging to let down their guard with someone they’ve just met. 

You may need to chat with Advocates casually a few different times before they feel comfortable enough to relax around you. 

Finally, make sure that you choose the right moment to ask out an Advocate. You might look at them quietly reading or enjoying a cup of coffee and think, “Oh good, they’re not doing anything\! This is the perfect time to ask them out.” But alone time is incredibly important to people with the Advocate personality type – it’s when they process their thoughts, consult their intuition, and restore their energy. So before you invite yourself to sit down with them, ask, “Hey, is this an okay time to talk?” And if the Advocate in question seems annoyed or distracted, give them space and leave the conversation for another time. 

Tip \#2: Be Real. Be Really Real. 

It’s human nature to want to impress someone you’re interested in. But phoniness and pretenses are major turnoffs for Advocates, and people with this personality type usually have a finely honed ability to detect when you’re being even the least bit fake. 

In short, asking out an Advocate is not a good time to pretend. Don’t worry about acting cool, don’t dress in a style that doesn’t feel natural to you, don’t play games, and for the love of all that is good in this world, don’t stretch the truth about your interests or hobbies in an effort to establish common ground. Avoid the temptation, for example, to act as if you love their favorite book if

16/07/2025, 18:50 How to Ask Out an Advocate (INFJ) | 16Personalitiesyou’ve never read it. Lying to an Advocate is one of the surest ways to lose their respect entirely. 

Advocates are drawn to authenticity and vulnerability, not attempts to be cool or impressive. 

So, how do you earn an Advocate’s respect? That’s a big question, but one key is vulnerability. Advocates tend to admire people who embrace their full selves – including the parts that aren’t cool or enviable or mainstream. So tell them what you’re passionate about, even if it’s nerdy. Tell them a funny story, even if it’s about something awkward that you did. Most Advocates would rather spend time with people who share real, distinctive things about themselves than with people who posture and try to seem cool. 

Tip \#3: Suggest an Advocate-Friendly Date 

Here at 16Personalities, we conduct a lot of surveys to refine our understanding of different personality types. And one of those surveys is our “Ideal Date” survey. Here are some survey findings that might help you come up with an Advocate-friendly date idea: 

Nearly 91% of Advocates say they prefer a date that’s inexpensive or free, so steer away from anything that’s too extravagant. 

Close to 96% of Advocates say their ideal date includes deep conversation, so don’t suggest a loud venue where you wouldn’t be able to hear each other. 

More than 85% of Advocates express a preference for doing only one or two activities on a date, so don’t plan an all-day extravaganza with many different activities. 

Conclusions 

Asking someone out always comes with the risk of being rejected – no matter how perfectly you tailor your approach to their personality type. That said, we hope that these tips have given you some insight into what may or may not work when asking an Advocate out on a date. 

So, readers: Have you ever asked out an Advocate? If you’re an Advocate, what would make you want to go on a date with someone? Tell us in the comments below\!

ROMANCE 

Different Ways to Say “I Love You”:   
Love Language and Personality Type TRACI 49 COMMENTS 

“The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in.” 

Morrie Schwartz, Tuesdays with Morrie 

Some people wear their heart on their sleeve. When they love someone, that someone knows it. 

These are people who dote on their romantic partners, are generous with their affection, and never hesitate to say “I love you.” They make their appreciation obvious through words and actions, leaving no doubt as to their devotion. For 

these personality types, expressing love comes naturally – it’s a fundamental part of their nature. 

For others, well…you might need to read between the lines to find reassurance of their feelings. It’s not that they don’t feel love, it’s just not characteristic for some folks to express those feelings through physical displays of affection, let alone romantic words or lavish praise. 

The theory that different people have different ways of communicating love is not new. The challenge is in learning to recognize our differences, appreciate them for what they are, and communicate more effectively by taking them into consideration. 

Love makes the world go round, right?

16/07/2025, 18:48 Different Ways to Say “I Love You”: Love Language and Personality Type | 16PersonalitiesWe love our romantic partners, our children, our parents, and our pets, and many of us deeply love our friends. It can be argued that love is the vital undercurrent of our most important relationships. 

Despite the undeniable influence of environmental, social, and cultural factors, personality type is an excellent predictor of how someone communicates love and appreciation. By analyzing the different personality traits, we can get a fairly reliable sense of how a person prefers to say, or show, “I love you.” At the same time, we can get a solid idea of how they prefer to hear that message from someone else. 

How we receive love is just as important to understand as how we show it. 

Taking the time to explore this aspect of your personality will help you more clearly understand your wants and needs when it comes to emotional expression in your closest relationships. It may also help you identify those modes of communication that might cause misunderstandings with your loved ones. 

7 Ways to Say “I Love You” 

After analyzing our research and carefully reviewing multiple surveys completed by 16Personalities members, we came up with a comprehensive list of ways that people show their love. 

1\. Thoughtful Actions 

Some people feel most loved and appreciated when their partner steps in to help with practical matters, without being asked. For others, helping those they love is a heartfelt manifestation of their feelings. If they can be of service and lighten another’s load, it’s their pleasure to do so. 

2\. Economic Priority 

Some personality types feel most seen, loved, and appreciated when their partner puts them on top of their economic priorities list. While this could be as simple as giving gifts, economic displays of love aren’t always superficial. For example, someone may offer financial support while a loved one pursues a life goal. 

When a person shows their love this way, it is a source of great pleasure for them to prioritize and support their loved ones through economical means. 

3\. Recognition and Appreciation 

©20112025 NERIS Analytics Limited. https://www.16personalities.com   
16/07/2025, 18:48 Different Ways to Say “I Love You”: Love Language and Personality Type | 16PersonalitiesWhen someone shows their love through recognition and appreciation, you can expect them to be generous with their compliments. It’s easy for them to say those magic words: “I love you.” They see what their loved ones do and are never shy to call attention to it in the most loving of ways. 

For certain people, in order to know they are loved, it is fundamental that they feel seen and appreciated. When their efforts go unnoticed, it can be devastating. 

4\. Time and Attention 

Many personality types feel most loved when they receive plenty of one-on-one time and focused attention. For others, there’s no need to say the words “I love you” when they can show it by prioritizing time to focus on the people they love. 

5\. Physical Closeness 

Love can be expressed physically through a variety of ways: a hug, a soft caress, holding hands, or simply sitting in close proximity. In an intimate relationship, sex is often the epitome of love through physical expression. 

The only bona fide way for some people to know they are loved is through physical closeness with their loved ones. For others, the easiest way to show their affection is through physical touch. 

6\. Psychological Support 

Certain personality types are deeply connected with their emotions. When they feel psychologically supported and heard, and when they are given the freedom to fully express themselves, they know they are loved. At the same time, they find deep fulfillment and personal satisfaction expressing their love by emotionally supporting others. 

7\. Cerebral Stimulation 

While some people are all about emotional support, others thrive on intellectual connection. They feel most loved when they know their minds are valued and appreciated. For these personality types, there is nothing quite like intensely engaging with the mind of another person. 

If your loved one asks you probing questions and wants to know the ins and outs of your big ideas, they are showing their love through cerebral stimulation. 

How Different Roles Express Their Love 

©20112025 NERIS Analytics Limited. https://www.16personalities.com   
16/07/2025, 18:48 Different Ways to Say “I Love You”: Love Language and Personality Type | 16Personalities“Love is friendship that has caught fire. It is quiet understanding, mutual confidence, sharing and forgiving. It is loyalty through good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses.” 

Ann Landers 

So, how do different personalities prefer to express themselves when it comes to love? 

As mentioned earlier, there are a myriad of factors that influence how a person expresses themselves outside the scope of their personality type. At the same time, certain personality traits play an undeniably strong role in how someone expresses their love and appreciation for other people. 

Because there are 16 distinct personality types, we’re not going to go into each one in great detail in this article. Instead, we’re going to look at the similarities found within the groups of personality types that make up the four different Roles: Analysts, Diplomats, Sentinels, and Explorers. 

Analysts: The Key to Their Heart Is in Their Mind 

Analysts, with their shared Intuitive and Thinking traits, are highly rational people who don’t mind their alone time. Architects (INTJ), Logicians (INTP), Commanders (ENTJ), and Debaters (ENTP) certainly have their differences in personality. But one thing that they have in common is that they’re not particularly sophisticated when it comes to expressing subtle emotions. Don’t expect them to be overly showy when it comes to love and affection. 

In general, Analysts have little need for traditional, ritual expressions of love. They aren’t big on giving gifts – even receiving them can be an uncomfortable experience. Hugging or other physical displays of affection are not exactly in the comfort zone for most of them. 

Analysts are strongly intellectual. So, while each individual will vary, you can expect nearly every Analyst to really light up with vigorous cerebral stimulation. Showing their love through intellectual engagement, they connect with loved ones through lively discussions driven by genuine interest and curiosity. 

Analysts want to be with people who fundamentally get them. So if you want an Analyst to know you love them, challenge that mind of theirs with some thought provoking conversation. Throw in some recognition and appreciation for all that

16/07/2025, 18:48 Different Ways to Say “I Love You”: Love Language and Personality Type | 16Personalitiesthey do and are – especially the ways they challenge themselves – and you’ll surely work your way into their hearts. 

Diplomats: See Them for Who They Are 

Diplomat personality types, on the other hand, tend to be highly affectionate and expressive with their emotions – especially when that emotion is love. Defined by their shared Intuitive and Feeling traits, Advocates (INFJ), Mediators (INFP), Protagonists (ENFJ), and Campaigners (ENFP) intrinsically value personal connection and forge deep bonds with the people they love. 

Diplomats show their love in a variety of ways – there’s no single “love language” that these personalities prefer. They help the people they love through thoughtful actions. If they are able to economically prioritize their loved ones, they do so with an open heart. They love giving gifts, even if there is no special occasion. 

Seeking connection through mind, body, and soul, they value physical closeness and offering psychological support. They even love cerebral stimulation – nothing says “I love you” quite like discussing altruistic principles and deep-rooted ideals. 

To let a Diplomat know you love them, start with recognition and appreciation. See what they do and who they are. Tell them just how much all their effort means to you. Reveal your affection through words, be generous with your time and attention, and offer plenty of psychological support. 

Sentinels: It’s What They Do, Not What They Say 

As a group, Sentinel personality types (who share the Observant and Judging traits) are practical traditionalists when it comes to showing love and affection. 

Because they are “doers,” expect the Logisticians (ISTJ), Defenders (ISFJ), Executives (ESTJ), and Consuls (ESFJ) in your life to show their love through thoughtful actions of every kind. They are always looking to put their productive powers to good use. 

Sentinels may not be prone to dramatic gestures of love, but you might be pleased by a thoughtfully selected gift on the appropriate holiday or a well timed gesture of gratitude. Recognizing the importance of one-on-one time, they’ll gladly dedicate time and attention to loved ones. 

If you want to tell a Sentinel “I love you,” start with recognition and appreciation. Make sure that they know you value their contributions. They

16/07/2025, 18:48 Different Ways to Say “I Love You”: Love Language and Personality Type | 16Personalitiesthrive when they feel needed. While not exactly the most overtly sensitive group of personality types, Sentinels generally appreciate having their feelings recognized, and they value being seen. 

Explorers: Hang On for the Ride 

Virtuoso (ISTP), Adventurer (ISFP), Entrepreneur (ESTP), and Entertainer (ESFP) personality types are true pleasure-seekers in life, craving physical affection, novelty, and adventure. 

When it comes to their love, Explorer types have a talent for making the object of their affection feel special. They’ll often dedicate undivided time and attention to the ones they love, giving that person economic priority when it comes to gifts or spontaneous adventures (even if they don’t have the means). They have a way of making a loved one feel special with words of recognition and appreciation. 

Because they share the Observant and Prospecting traits, it’s hard to generalize Explorer personality types – especially when it comes to how they like to receive shows of love. So we’ll leave you with these simple words of advice: match their 

stride. Physical closeness, recognition and appreciation, and showing them economic priority all reach straight to their heart.

Getting on the Same Page: Foundational Definitions 

Boundaries are loosely a way of saying, “This is mine. I value it because I respect myself.” Brené Brown defines boundaries simply, and probably more accurately, as, “What’s okay and what’s not okay.” 

Our topic is personality types and boundaries in romance. So, keeping in mind that personality theory is the target that we’re ultimately aiming for, let’s first set a foundation so that we know we’re talking about the same thing. 

“Wait a minute. Are boundaries necessary in a romantic relationship?” you might ask. “I mean, doesn’t love dissolve the need for barriers?” It’s a fanciful notion to believe that two people meet, fall in love, and blend seamlessly – two become one, literally. 

Boundaries are fluid things that change depending on who we are with. We would expect that two people in a romantic relationship would have more open “borders” than, for example, acquaintances at work. Connection and compromise are part of a love relationship, more so than what might be expected with any other relationship. However, individuality remains throughout a love relationship. So, while there may be fewer places that one partner would insist on maintaining boundaries, having boundaries is still important to the growth of the individual partner. How skillfully each partner negotiates boundaries is often where the shared growth of a relationship occurs. 

Most of us understand that, while common interests are important, there are still two distinct individuals involved, each possessing individual concerns. In relationships, things between two people can sometimes overlap where perhaps they shouldn’t. Tensions can rise and cause unnecessary bumps in the road for a couple if boundaries aren’t clear. Learning to navigate the borders of individuality in a relationship is essential for harmony. 

Let’s speculate about how boundaries might work according to personality types. 

If you don’t know your personality type, please take our free test and find out which traits you possess. 

The numbers may vary depending on who is talking about the subject, but there are basically six ways that people can violate an individual’s boundaries: 

©20112025 NERIS Analytics Limited. https://www.16personalities.com   
16/07/2025, 18:48 I Love You, but You Can’t Do That: Boundaries, Love, and Personality Types | 16Personalities Emotional or feelings: This happens when someone invades a person’s emotional space by either pressing them to share their feelings before they’re ready to talk about the issue at hand or by causing emotional pain through unwarranted disapproval or some other insult to the person.  Physical: You know that person who keeps touching your shoulder and standing so close that you become uncomfortable? Yeah. That’s a physical boundary violation. It can be as simple as getting into someone’s personal space or as extreme as unwanted physical contact of any sort (whether affectionate, violent, or anything else). 

 Intellectual: This violation occurs when people are demeaned or rejected disrespectfully for their ideas and thoughts. A healthy and welcome critique is not a boundary violation, although one might want to be careful if it feels like there’s some power play involved. That could be a sneaky violation.  Schedule or time: This violation is about one person insisting on wasting another person’s time. 

 Sexual: Any unwanted contact of a sexual nature, including suggestive comments, ogling, or touching, is a sign of this boundary violation.  Material: A material violation happens when someone touches an individual’s belongings without their permission. Extreme material boundary violations can include damaging personal property and theft. 

While any of these boundary violations can occur in a romantic relationship, the emotional and intellectual infringements are more likely to be the culprits that bring about the most trouble. (See Romantic Conflicts: Four Horsemen and Four Personality Type Groups.) 

To further refine the topic, we can categorize boundaries in three ways: 

A healthy boundary is when an individual controls their personal space and has strong enough boundaries where needed, yet is flexible enough to let others in when appropriate. They feel comfortable saying no when they want to deny a request. They are assertive enough to protect and preserve that which belongs to them on all levels. They remain flexible and easily move their boundaries when it works in their favor wholesomely, but this should reflect growth rather than surrender. 

A porous boundary is when someone “leaks” too many of the things that they should cherish and protect or lets too many things in that may not benefit them. Metaphorically, they open their doors to too many people too freely. If they are sharing something that needs to stay private, even one person who receives too

16/07/2025, 18:48 I Love You, but You Can’t Do That: Boundaries, Love, and Personality Types | 16Personalitiesmuch information becomes “too many people.” Someone who overshares on social media is a good example. 

People with porous boundaries often do things not because they want to but because they don’t want to hurt somebody’s feelings by declining a request. They might find themselves almost incapacitated because a friend is going through rough times – it’s almost like they can’t distinguish between their feelings and desires and those of someone else. 

A rigid boundary is all about control and not wanting anyone to see one’s flaws and weaknesses. Consequently, people with rigid boundaries profoundly limit the number of other people they “let in.” In a romantic relationship, they may not let their partner in enough. The fear of showing vulnerability can prevent growth and healthy relationships. Black-and-white thinking is sometimes a side effect of keeping control: control is easier to keep if it’s broken down into good and bad or some other simplistic set of choices. There is no middle ground. 

Nobody sits in only one of the three categories without ever venturing into the other two. A lot depends on the situation and the other people involved. 

A person might put up rigid boundaries in a new dating situation and curate what the potential romantic partner sees. (For example, saying they have no opinion on a subject when they do, but they fear revealing their position because it might not be what their date wants to hear.) Simultaneously, their boundary may have a few porous spots if they are people pleasers and feel that they want to gratify their date. (For instance, agreeing to go for sushi when they hate sushi, but their new date loves it.) 

The Interplay of Traits and Boundaries 

With personality study, some sweeping generalizations about traits might be reasonably made. For example, people with the Introverted and Judging personality traits might be more susceptible to rigid boundaries. On the other hand, those with the Extraverted and Prospecting personality traits may be more susceptible to the more open, porous boundaries. These tendencies spring out of too much or too little of something and are determined by degrees. Here are a few thoughts on how traits may sometimes play a role with boundaries: 

Introverted people may be more comfortable closing themselves off from others, and if this tendency is excessive, they may do so rigidly. 

Judging personality types may regard too much feedback from others as endangering their sense of a set order to things – best to close the gates rather than let disruptors in.

16/07/2025, 18:48 I Love You, but You Can’t Do That: Boundaries, Love, and Personality Types | 16PersonalitiesExtraverts draw energy from others, and if this gets too extreme, they may let too many other people into places where privacy might be more appropriate. 

Prospecting personality types are open to many things, including the ideas or attitudes of others, and they may be less concerned about others disrupting the order of things. The reverse can also be true when Prospecting types overshare the many things happening in their lives. 

This doesn’t mean that each trait is confined to only one type of boundary. Extraverts can possess rigid boundaries in their own fashion, for example. But the fundamental characteristics of the trait suggest that those who possess it might lean one way or another. 

What about You? 

But that’s enough foundation building. Let’s talk about you. 

This article aims to explore the various boundary issues that might be bothersome for each personality type. We’ll briefly examine what healthy, porous, and rigid boundaries for each type might look like when a loving relationship is present. 

As with many things, personality may have a significant influence on boundaries, but other factors are also at play. Life is more complex, and that complexity doesn’t allow putting all the weight of boundaries on personality alone. So, if a description doesn’t resonate, no worries – these are generalizations based solely on what influence might come from a particular constellation of personality traits. So, as they say, your mileage may vary. 

Love, Boundaries, and Boundary Issues 

Analyst Personality Types 

Architect (INTJ) 

Healthy: Individual Architects with healthy boundaries are strong enough in their many opinions not only to stand firm when their partner may not understand or approve – but also to respect their significant other even when they disagree. They’re comfortable standing on their own and being part of a couple simultaneously. They are also flexible enough to change their plans if their partner makes a compelling case against a direction that they are headed in.

16/07/2025, 18:48 I Love You, but You Can’t Do That: Boundaries, Love, and Personality Types | 16PersonalitiesPorous: Architects’ boundaries are likely to be most porous when it comes to offering advice that their partner hasn’t asked for or providing insights too readily. Also, playing with various ideas, Architects may offer their thoughts freely without telling their significant other that their musings are not a real option but simply an intellectual exercise. 

Rigid: Like their healthy boundaries, Architects’ more rigid boundaries also have them standing on their own, not so much from a confident and assertive place but more from a defensive place. They are likely to hold their cards extremely close to avoid anybody questioning their hand. Collaboration is avoided at all costs when their borders are closed. 

Logician (INTP) 

Healthy: Logicians’ boundaries are healthiest when people with this personality type protect their right to explore without apology, even when their partner doesn’t understand them. And yet, if their significant other requires a more structured direction in their life, Logicians with healthy boundaries remain respectful of their partner’s needs. They also understand that not everything needs to be said and choose their words with attention to the feelings and interests of the person they love. 

Porous: Logician personalities’ boundaries are most porous when they shoot their discoveries and knowledge at their partner in rapid-fire succession. This flooding of information is especially grievous if their goal is to get their loved one to appreciate how clever they are. They may also have trouble deciding on or sticking to any boundaries at all. Such vacillation can cause confusion and anxiety as their partner struggles to find their way around the Logician’s borders. 

Rigid: Boundaries are most rigid when Logicians live up to their reputation of being eccentric loners. When they go into themselves and don’t let others into their world, they are likely missing out on valuable stuff. That reality is probably multiplied when what they are missing out on are the gifts brought by a loving relationship. 

Commander (ENTJ) 

Healthy: Commanders’ boundaries are healthiest when they allow people with this personality type to interact with others in an intelligent and organized manner. This also permits them to be flexible and respectful enough of others. There may be a “take charge” mindset, but it’s reasonable and welcomes ample input from their partner. 

©20112025 NERIS Analytics Limited. https://www.16personalities.com   
16/07/2025, 18:48 I Love You, but You Can’t Do That: Boundaries, Love, and Personality Types | 16PersonalitiesPorous: The word “overbearing” may best describe Commanders with porous boundaries. If they are leaking their imperatives all over the relationship, it can be overwhelming for their partner – especially if their partner isn’t feeling heard. 

Rigid: Commanders with rigid boundaries won’t have the flexibility necessary for a relationship where a healthy give-and-take is valued by the other partner. With rigid boundaries, the “take charge” mindset leaves a reasonable attitude behind in favor of dictatorial and demanding stances. Such a stance is likely to turn off all but the most passive partner. 

Debater (ENTP) 

Healthy: Debaters with healthy boundaries share their best ideas with their partner and remain open to their partner’s ideas. They can regulate their impulse to deconstruct and “fix” any ideas that their partner shares, showing respect and love instead. 

Porous: “Unrelenting” is the word that comes to mind for Debaters with porous boundaries. Expressing an opinion about everything can exhaust a partner who is virtually a captive audience. 

Rigid: Debaters with rigid boundaries have little tolerance for anything that doesn’t align with their opinions. The give-and-take of a romantic relationship can become either tense or nonexistent. 

Diplomat Personality Types 

Advocate (INFJ) 

Healthy: Individual Advocates who possess healthy boundaries live up to the tolerance that they like to believe is an essential part of who they are. When boundaries are well balanced, Advocate personalities maintain and 

protect their convictions. They are also careful with their opinions and voice them judiciously, and they listen carefully to their partner’s thoughts. They respect their significant other regardless of whether they agree or disagree. 

Porous: Advocate personality types can be preachy when their boundary floodgates are open, and a partner may have limited capacity to listen to nonstop sermons. Advocates may leave little space for their significant other’s voice among the many moral lectures. 

Rigid: Individual Advocates who maintain unyielding boundaries may close themselves off from their partner and ponder solitary thoughts instead of speaking their mind. When they decide to share their convictions, they may

16/07/2025, 18:48 I Love You, but You Can’t Do That: Boundaries, Love, and Personality Types | 16Personalitiesprovide little room for debate, leaving their significant other believing that their own ideas and actions are insignificant. 

Mediator (INFP) 

Healthy: A Mediator with healthy boundaries knows what keeps them feeling safe. When these personalities are in a strong space, they are assertive enough to draw a line when something feels overwhelming or potentially painful. They know how to send their partner clear messages about the things to which they may be sensitive. They share enough to create an intense bond but not so much that they monopolize the conversation with the things that trigger them. 

Porous: The word that comes to mind for Mediators with porous boundaries is “unedited.” All their sensitivities and emotions live near the surface when their boundaries lack rigor. They become so reactive that their partner may feel like they have no choice but to walk on eggshells constantly. 

Rigid: Mediator personalities are likely more rigid when they withdraw rather than sharing their concerns and sensitivities in an appropriate manner. They may choose to suffer in silence rather than confide in their partner. A Mediator’s silence can cause a bigger rift than this caring type would ever want. 

Protagonist (ENFJ) 

Healthy: Protagonists with healthy boundaries share in the truest sense of the word. They not only give of themselves but they also reasonably expect that their significant other will return the favor. However, their expectations of their partner are realistic, and Protagonists strive to ensure that both partners are clear about what they can expect from each other. 

Porous: Protagonist personality types have porous boundaries when they can’t separate their partner’s problems and feelings from their own, and they may fail to protect their own interests or preserve their energy and well-being. Or, on the other side of the same coin, a Protagonist with weak boundaries may sometimes be too pushy trying to be helpful. They may not know when to back down. They may also be unable to let their significant other solve their problems in their own way. 

Rigid: Unilaterally formed assumptions could be the brick and mortar of a Protagonist’s rigid border wall. If their Judging personality trait is too dominant, they may assume that they hold the key to what is real and right and expect their partner to fall in line, presuming that there’s no need for a discussion.

16/07/2025, 18:48 I Love You, but You Can’t Do That: Boundaries, Love, and Personality Types | 16PersonalitiesCampaigner (ENFP) 

Healthy: Healthy boundaries for Campaigner individuals might include creating clearly defined borders that still honor their flexible and somewhat freewheeling nature. These personalities can enjoy and connect with their partner through their adventurous spirit and have a sense of when to put the lid on their expectations and people-pleasing. 

Porous: Campaigners may sometimes be too quick to give in to the whims and wishes of their partner. They may wish to please them or avoid making waves. Their own criteria for boundaries may change too often to communicate accurately and consistently to their partner what they will and will not allow in their lives. 

Rigid: Campaigners have a complex balance between their need and want for independence and their sensitivity. Rigidity can look like extreme independence one moment and, paradoxically, a perfectionism designed to try to be all that they believe (rightly or wrongly) that their partner wants and needs them to be the next. Either one of these can take on an uncompromising flavor and leave the person they love outside of the decision-making. 

Sentinel Personality Types 

Logistician (ISTJ) 

Healthy: Logisticians with healthy boundaries recognize how to protect their need for privacy and are assertive about this need. However, their need for being on their own is likely balanced with respect for their partner’s need to be aware of what is happening and their need to have the Logistician’s attention and presence. Logisticians’ healthy boundaries are flexible enough to enable them to realize when to stand firm and when to compromise in their interactions with their significant other. 

Porous: The key phrase here is “unsolicited and unnecessary opinions.” Sometimes saying less is the most effective response in life, but Logisticians likely abandon that principle with porous boundaries. An old self-help phrase goes, “Do you want to be right, or do you want to be loved?” This saying may come in handy for Logisticians who are in relationships and are prone to porous boundaries. 

Rigid: Logisticians may be one of the personality types most susceptible to rigid boundaries. Their Introverted, Thinking, and Judging traits may make it hard for them to let others in or to let much of themselves out. A romantic

16/07/2025, 18:48 I Love You, but You Can’t Do That: Boundaries, Love, and Personality Types | 16Personalitiespartner may not feel welcome to make suggestions or express opinions in a relationship where the Logistician maintains strict boundaries. 

Defender (ISFJ) 

Healthy: Healthy boundaries for Defenders protect these personalities while also protecting the values and people important to them. Defenders with well-adjusted boundaries resist their tendency to be internal, and they promote the idea that each partner contributes to the decision-making and direction of the relationship. Values are also mutually explored with their partner. By the same token, when necessary, Defenders stand firm on their principled diligence for themselves as individuals, without necessarily demanding that their partner mimic them. 

Porous: When Defender personalities are sold on something or someone outside of their relationship, they can become overly passionate and loyal. If their partner is not of the same mind, the Defender may vigorously defend the object of their fidelity, whether or not the defense is necessary. Such a defense can cause tension for no reason at all. For example: harping on a political candidate despite knowing that their partner isn’t a supporter. 

Rigid: Defenders’ boundaries may become rigid when they try to make a partner with a different temperament align with their own. They’re not likely to do this in an aggressive or assertive manner, but they may telegraph their intolerance for anything other than their own style in a passive way. Whether Defender personalities discuss their expectations with their partner or not, those expectations will likely be present all the same. 

Executive (ESTJ) 

Healthy: For an Executive in love, healthy boundaries allow them to be honest with their partner while keeping an eye on their significant other’s feelings. Executive personality types will respect their partner’s independent thoughts and ideas. A healthy boundary would likely involve an Executive who is willing to compromise and consider their partner’s input. 

Porous: Executives with porous boundaries require control over everything in their relationship. Every opinion comes without much thought about the opinions or needs of their partner. As a result, every expression may be something of an imperative, and it may appear as though they are trying to rob their significant other of their power. 

Rigid: The rallying cry for Executives with rigid boundaries may be, “I’ve got this.” But such a declaration is more than an expression of confidence here. 

©20112025 NERIS Analytics Limited. https://www.16personalities.com   
16/07/2025, 18:48 I Love You, but You Can’t Do That: Boundaries, Love, and Personality Types | 16PersonalitiesThe assertion is more of a cry of exclusive control that might leave their partner with a sense of being irrelevant and underappreciated. 

Consul (ESFJ) 

Healthy: Consuls are the personality type most likely to seek a long-term commitment. A healthy boundary would be honoring Consuls’ need for stability with the person they love while not overwhelming that person with affection and attention. Despite their need for closeness, Consuls can remain individuals and allow the person they love the same latitude. 

Porous: Consuls may have porous boundaries when everything becomes about the object of the Consul’s love, to the exclusion of their own wants and needs being met. Taken to the extreme, their boundaries may virtually disappear in a misguided attempt to nail down a permanent link with their partner. 

Rigid: For Consuls, a rigid boundary may happen when their need for commitment becomes a need for control, and too much of their motivation involves making sure that they and their significant other remain together. They may try to glue their relationship together in a pressured and adamant way, rather than letting the relationship blossom of its own accord. 

Explorer Personality Types 

Virtuoso (ISTP) 

Healthy: Healthy boundaries for Virtuosos who are part of a couple might involve standing firm in their need to focus on what matters to them. But Virtuoso personalities with clear boundaries can regulate their more self indulgent impulses in favor of maintaining their commitment to their significant other. They are flexible enough not to leave their partner hanging alone too long while they pursue their own interests. 

Porous: Porous boundaries for Virtuosos are likely expressed when their need to break their boredom gets the best of them. Their own interests likely dictate their actions rather than a shared agreement with their partner. 

Rigid: According to our research, Virtuosos are the least likely personality type to say they are used to caring for others to the extent that they forget about their own needs. Rigid, for Virtuosos, may mean solidifying their boundaries to take care of themselves to the exclusion of their significant other. Care, in a relationship with such boundaries, would be mostly self care.

16/07/2025, 18:48 I Love You, but You Can’t Do That: Boundaries, Love, and Personality Types | 16PersonalitiesAdventurer (ISFP) 

Healthy: Adventurers with healthy boundaries in a relationship can hold their own with decisions and conflicts. Boundaries defining their wants and needs dictate their autonomy during such interactions, and their self-doubts are contained enough to not be the determining factor. Still, they would be free to explore any sensitivities that they have with their partner without allowing their fears to become the central topic of all discussions. 

Porous: As we telegraphed in the healthy boundaries section, Adventurers with more porous boundaries tend to leak any self-esteem issues into too many aspects of their time with their partner. Being honest about self-doubt is important, but when such discussions become unrelenting, they can potentially take over and replace other wholesome interactions. 

Rigid: Rigid boundaries might let Adventurers’ sensitivities rule to the extent that these personalities become afraid to be honest with their partner. Adventurers are more likely to shut down and not share with such boundaries, leaving their significant other wondering about many aspects of the Adventurer’s experience. 

Entrepreneur (ESTP) 

Healthy: Entrepreneur personality types perceive themselves as bold risk takers. When they have healthy boundaries in a romantic relationship, they can exercise their need to step out and try new things. But they also balance that need against the needs of their partner. They are open to their loved one sharing their excitement but don’t demand that they do so. These Entrepreneurs preserve their relationship as one of the highest priorities among their cavalcade of constant change. 

Porous: In our research, Entrepreneurs report feeling impulsive and having a low tolerance for boredom more than any other personality type. Porous boundaries for them might be when they can’t contain those qualities and, as a result, push for things to be more novel and spontaneous, even when their partner (and life) may require something more routine and stable. 

Rigid: Entrepreneurs are often consumed by the bold, new, and exciting. Being so locked into these shiny objects, they may project the importance of these things to their partner in some form of, “This is what counts to me. So it’s my way or the highway.” This, of course, leaves their partner on the outside looking in, with no sense of power in the relationship. 

Entertainer (ESFP) 

©20112025 NERIS Analytics Limited. https://www.16personalities.com   
16/07/2025, 18:48 I Love You, but You Can’t Do That: Boundaries, Love, and Personality Types | 16PersonalitiesHealthy: Entertainers typically view themselves as generous. For example, they are the personality type least likely to say they dislike lending things to others. Healthy boundaries for them in a relationship may involve balancing that self-concept against their own needs. Entertainers with well-adjusted boundaries will express their giving nature toward their partner without falling into the trap of people-pleasing. 

Porous: The key phrase for Entertainers with porous boundaries may be “people-pleasing.” They may feel that their identity and worth are connected to what they can give others. Their boundaries may not contain ample self-interest. While that may sound noble, a romantic relationship is more promising when both individuals get enough of their needs met. 

Rigid: Is there such a thing as stubbornly giving too much? Perhaps for Entertainer personalities, a rigid boundary does not allow their partner to be the magnanimous one often enough. This may be especially true if the Entertainer holds on to a self-concept and sense of worth that says that they are the one who brings all the gifts and good times. 

Opening and Closing the Gates 

“Don’t go changing, 

To try and please me, 

You never let me down before…” 

BILLY JOEL, “JUST THE WAY YOU ARE” 

The value of healthy boundaries is not so much about keeping people out of one’s life – especially if it’s the person who has become closer to you than any other. That thinking is the negative, rigid approach. It’s more about preserving the individuality that each person brings to the relationship to begin with. It’s continuing to cherish the unique characteristics, both large and small, and the sensibilities that caused the sparks to fly when each partner finally realized that they were in love. 

A boundary is when one partner insists on keeping some area of their life as something that they own and that defines them. Loving that which defines the other is the romantic part. 

Letting someone be who they are in a love relationship is probably among the most generous acts that can be gifted to a romantic partner.

RESEARCH AND INSIGHTS 

I’m the Humblest Person I Know:   
Personality Type and Humility 

8 COMMENTS 

Anyone who ever listened to Garrison Keillor’s recurring “News from Lake Wobegon” monologue on the radio show A Prairie Home Companion knows the familiar refrain that described his fictional Minnesota hometown: “Where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.” 

And they’re all humble too\! Well, not exactly. 

What Keillor captured in the fictional characters of Lake Wobegon was the natural, and very real, human tendency to overestimate our own capabilities, achievements, and positive attributes. He portrayed this phenomenon so well, in fact, that a professor of psychology at Hope College coined it “the Lake Wobegon effect.” Our tendency to consider ourselves better than the average person is also known as the “self-enhancement effect.” 

It is particularly interesting to explore this effect as it relates to our perception of our own humility. We asked our readers to agree or disagree with the statement, “You are a very humble person.” At first, that statement might give you pause: Would truly humble people be comfortable describing themselves as “very humble”? 

The short answer is yes. The fact that 78% of our readers agreed with the statement – with certain personality types agreeing at rates approaching 100% – doesn’t seem nearly as surprising (or ironic) in light of the Lake Wobegon effect.

16/07/2025, 20:37 I’m the Humblest Person I Know: Personality Type and Humility | 16PersonalitiesThe results of our survey can actually tell us a lot about how genuine modesty may be determined by personality type. Self-inflation aside, our readers proved to be reasonably self-aware when it came to understanding their own humility, and the results indicated that how humble we are hinges mainly on one aspect of our personality: our Nature. 

Let’s dive into the data below. 

Agreement with “You are a very humble person.”

Diplomats (84% agreeing) 

Being humble means not being proud or arrogant, and not thinking you’re better than other people. Rather than focusing on yourself – on your own accomplishments or your own self-interest – you put other people’s needs and feelings first. And that’s just what personality types with the Feeling trait do. Readers who fell on the Feeling end of the Nature scale (85% agreeing) were 21% more likely than Thinking types (64%) to agree that they are very humble. 

Diplomats, who all share the Feeling trait, agreed the most. Far more interested in empathy and harmony than in superiority and competition, Diplomat personalities recognize that showing humility in their social interactions will contribute to positive group dynamics and set others at ease. 

Of course, humility is not just a sound strategy for communication and diplomacy – for many people, it is also a personal virtue to which they consciously aspire. This is perhaps most true of Advocates, who, as their name suggests, devote themselves to helping others and serving a greater good. Assertive Advocates were the personality type that agreed with our statement at the highest rate: 94%. 

©20112025 NERIS Analytics Limited. https://www.16personalities.com   
16/07/2025, 20:37 I’m the Humblest Person I Know: Personality Type and Humility | 16PersonalitiesIt’s natural that most Advocates, as idealistic and perceptive personality types, would not only frown on vanity and boastfulness but also have the self awareness to recognize and avoid those traits in themselves. Mother Teresa is the perfect example of a humble Advocate, as she both embodied humility and urged others to do the same. As she once wrote, “Very humble work, that is where you and I must be. For there are many people who can do big things. But there are very few people who will do the small things.” 

Sentinels (81%) 

Sentinels’ and Explorers’ responses were significantly divided around the Nature aspect, with Feeling types agreeing at much higher rates. But on average, Sentinels were slightly more likely than Explorers to agree that they are very humble because of their Judging trait, which motivates these personalities to put their duties and obligations first; focused on their personal responsibilities, they often have little time for bragging about their accomplishments. 

Assertive Defenders (91%) were almost as likely as Advocates to agree with our statement. But for this personality type in particular, humility, when taken too far, can become a weakness. Often shy, self-effacing, and hesitant to take credit for 

their achievements, even when it is due, Defenders are always at risk of being taken advantage of by other, more ambitious types, and of missing out on well deserved opportunities. For them, a little boasting may be a good thing. 

Interestingly, the least likely personality type of all to agree was also a Sentinel: Turbulent Executives agreed at a rate of just 57%. An important aspect of humility is understanding that you don’t know everything and being willing to learn and grow. Executives, however, because they are so grounded in traditions and values, are very confident in their own concept of right and wrong, in their own knowledge, and in their own way of doing things, to the point that they can exclude all other ideas. 

Frank Sinatra was an Executive personality type, and the lyrics to his famous song “My Way” illustrate this tendency well. It’s difficult for Executives to feel empathy and express their emotions, which can make them judgmental of others. Executives are often model citizens (not too unlike the “above-average” fictional residents of Lake Wobegon), and they take a lot of pride in their status within the communities to which they belong. Pride, of course, is the opposite of humility, and Executives must guard against becoming too proud and self righteous. 

Explorers (77%) 

©20112025 NERIS Analytics Limited. https://www.16personalities.com   
16/07/2025, 20:37 I’m the Humblest Person I Know: Personality Type and Humility | 16PersonalitiesExplorers showed a lower rate of agreement because of their Prospecting trait. Always seeking out the best, most exciting opportunities, Explorer personality types tend to make personal satisfaction their first priority. That’s not to say that they don’t help others, just that they won’t necessarily put others’ needs first all of the time. Explorers like to live in the moment and generally don’t put much stock into behaving in the traditional ways expected of them, so if a situation seems to call for a little bragging, they’ll run with it. 

As with Sentinels, the more emotionally sensitive Explorers – Adventurers (85%) and Entertainers (81%) – agreed at much higher rates than those with the Thinking personality trait – Virtuosos (62%) and Entrepreneurs (60%). 

Analysts (64%) 

“Humility” probably isn’t a word that you would instantly associate with Analysts, and indeed, Analysts were the least likely to regard themselves as very humble people. With their shared Thinking trait, Analyst personality types value their own intellect a great deal, much more than they do other people’s emotional sensitivities, and they tend to be dismissive of those who can’t keep pace with their ideas. Analysts (especially Extraverted ones) must be careful, because if they don’t rein in their ego and apply their intellect to a worthy cause, they’re liable to be seen as blowhards. 

Turbulent Debaters (58%) were just behind Turbulent Executives in acknowledging that they tend not to be very humble. Unlike Executives, Debater personalities don’t believe that they have all the answers – that’s why they love engaging in debate in the first place, to learn new things and find new answers. 

The trouble is that Debaters do tend to believe that they are the ones most capable of figuring those answers out. People with this personality type make no effort to hide their conviction that they’re the smartest person in the room, and if you think otherwise, they’ll demand that you prove it to them. Debaters like to surround themselves with people who can match them intellectually, but their outspoken self-confidence can easily verge into arrogance.

Confident Individualism and Constant Improvement (82% and 81% agreeing) 

Compared to the Roles, we saw little variation among the four Strategies. Although there was virtually no difference between Assertive personality types (79%) and Turbulent types (78%), Introverts (81%) were slightly more likely than Extraverts (76%) to agree that they are very humble. Thus, we saw the two Introverted Strategies, Confident Individualism and Constant Improvement, at the top of the results. 

For some personality types, confidence can be a slippery slope to conceitedness; these types may not realize that truly humble people are actually very confident too – they just use that confidence quietly, to help others, rather than to assert their own importance. Confident Individualists are often quite humble because they are highly confident in their own abilities, but as Introverts, they feel little need to brag about them. 

Constant Improvers are also averse to the social spotlight, but they tend to have lower self-esteem and a strong inner critic. Although that can often be a weakness, when it comes to humility, it’s a strength. Constant Improvers are genuinely interested in asking questions, receiving feedback, learning new things, and working to improve themselves – and that makes them humble.

16/07/2025, 20:37 I’m the Humblest Person I Know: Personality Type and Humility | 16PersonalitiesPeople Mastery and Social Engagement (78% and 75%) 

The Extraverted personality types who belong to the People Mastery and Social Engagement Strategies love to immerse themselves in social experiences. Wrapping themselves in the energy and excitement of the moment, Extraverts can sometimes go too far, and their slightly lower responses indicate that they’re aware of this tendency. People Masters are confident and unafraid to speak their mind, and since they have a certain disregard for what other people think of them, they don’t worry too much if they sometimes come across as arrogant. 

Social Engagers, like Constant Improvers, tend to be insecure, and they’re especially concerned with the opinions of others. So while these personality types may put energy into improving themselves and trying to be humble, they can easily fall into a trap of boasting about their accomplishments or showing off their abilities, in the hopes of getting the positive feedback that they crave. 

Conclusion 

For many personality types, particularly Feeling types like Advocates and Defenders, humility is a way of life. It enables them to do good in the world, and to constantly grow and evolve for the better. 

Thinking types like Executives and Debaters, on the other hand, can often get too caught up in what they see as the superiority of their own abilities or ideas, putting their own interests ahead of others’, whether intentionally or not. These personality types may even misinterpret humility as a sign of meekness and passivity, assuming that modest people have little self-confidence or self respect. But as we’ve seen, that couldn’t be further from the truth. And while even the most modest and gracious among us can occasionally be guilty of too much pride, humility is certainly a worthy virtue, and we could all benefit from trying to be a bit more humble. 

Do you see yourself as a humble person? Maybe you think humility is overrated, or is best in moderation? Go ahead and share your thoughts below\!

Because people with the ESFJ personality type (Consuls) prize social validation and a sense of belonging so highly, romantic relationships hold a special level of importance for them. No other kind of relationship provides them with the same 

level of support and devotion. Consequently, the feelings of security and stability that come with strong romantic relationships are extremely fulfilling for ESFJs. 

ESFJ personalities don’t typically do casual flings. They need to know that their partner will always be by their side offering unwavering support – marriage and family are often the ultimate goal. 

ESFJs take each stage of a developing relationship, from dating to everything thereafter, very seriously. Everything about their relationships is based on satisfying mutual needs. They set out to create understanding early on and to build mutual respect and support for each other’s opinions and goals as time goes on. Knowing that they are loved and appreciated can have a huge effect on ESFJ personalities’ mood and self-esteem. 

A Tender Heart 

If they feel like the support that they crave isn’t there, such as when their partner delivers criticism, ESFJs can feel extremely hurt. People with this personality type dislike conflict and criticism, which can make it challenging to address any problems that come up. Nothing is more hurtful or depressing to them than to realize that their partner doesn’t respect their dreams or opinions. They can be

16/07/2025, 18:25 Romantic Relationships | ESFJ Personality (Consul) | INTP Personality (Logician) | 16Personalitiessurprisingly tough and tireless in the face of hardship, but they need to know without a doubt that their partner is behind them 100%. 

Unfortunately, less mature ESFJ personalities may lack the inner strength and wisdom to attract this in healthy ways. They can feel very lost without validation, compromising their own principles and values in exchange for their partner’s approval. This is a terrible trap – not only does it result in them losing touch with themselves but it can also too easily lead to being taken advantage of, which can further reduce their self-esteem. Another snare is their fixation on social status and approval – it’s not uncommon for their social circles and relatives to play a bigger part in their choice of dating partner than even their own values. 

Cultivating Trust 

ESFJs are warm, loyal people who want to feel trusted and valued. They feel very at peace when they are involved in a secure, steady, and loving relationship and have no problem with the dedication that monogamous relationships require. In fact, people with the ESFJ personality type tend to be particularly great with practical matters like money management and household tasks and are happy to take on such responsibilities in the name of taking care of the people they care about – a wonderful quality. 

ESFJs just need to make sure that they work to build relationships that also allow them to satisfy their own needs and dreams with a partner who appreciates their care and generosity fully and who reciprocates it in kind. While their natural disposition to care for others is commendable, they must remember not to neglect their own desires and aspirations in the process.

ROMANCE 

Self-Expression, Boundaries,   
and Love: Advocates (INFJ) and   
the Discomfort of Speaking Up 

TRACI 24 COMMENTS 

Advocates (INFJ) are sensitive and romantic types who usually look to partner up with someone who really gets them. True love – and a healthy relationship – includes being able to let down their guard and be vulnerable as their unfiltered and authentic self. 

But to be their authentic self, people with this personality type must become comfortable with one crucial aspect of relationship building – speaking up for their own interests. Sometimes it can be easier for these types to speak up for other people than it can be to voice their own needs, defend their beliefs, or communicate personal boundaries to their significant other. Unfortunately, by holding back, it’s more difficult to achieve the deep sense of intimacy that they crave in their romantic relationships. 

In the article “Self-Expression, Boundaries, and Love: Speaking Up When It Matters,” we briefly review how different personality Roles might face common stumbling blocks in their self-expression. Most Diplomats (the Role to which Advocates belong) have a distinctly lopsided approach. They are among the types most likely to encourage their partner to open up but often struggle to do so themselves. 

This has a lot to do with Diplomats’ shared Intuitive and Feeling traits. If we zoom in specifically on Advocates, we’ll find that these peacekeeping tendencies are uniquely shaped by the added influence of the Introverted and Judging traits.

16/07/2025, 18:39 Self-Expression, Boundaries, and Love: Advocates (INFJ) and the Discomfort of Speaking Up | 16PersonalitiesUnderstanding Advocates’ Hesitancy to Speak Up 

As Introverts, Advocates face particular challenges when it comes to speaking up. Doing so requires them to muster up the courage to take the reins in a conversation that they know could become uncomfortable. While most people with this personality type agree that vulnerability is essential for emotional closeness, there’s a good chance that opening up about what they need will result in heightened anxiety rather than relief. 

These personalities are also known to have high standards and expectations, which they may end up projecting outward onto their partner – often without that person ever knowing it. But rather than staying focused on the disappointment that their significant other’s behaviors may cause, Advocates often try to understand their partner’s feelings or motivations. This often results in tolerating actions and attitudes that, in reality, rub them the wrong way. 

Advocates are generally clear on what’s bothering them, are usually in tune with their emotions, and often know why they feel the way that they do – but their high threshold for tolerance, combined with their protective emotional reserve, may, unfortunately, manifest in a tendency to be somewhat defensive and guarded. 

Getting Behind the Defenses 

To understand this facet of Advocate personality types a little better, let’s explore certain personality-related characteristics that may contribute to their potentially self-limiting reserve. 

The tendencies that we discuss in this section tend to be true for this personality type as a whole – however, some Advocates may experience them more intensely than others. For Assertive types, these issues may be subtle or absent altogether, while more Turbulent personalities might immediately recognize themselves in these descriptions. Like every aspect of personality, these tendencies manifest on a spectrum. 

Fear of Rejection 

One reason why Advocates might hold back on speaking up is because doing so opens up the possibility of rejection. In a new relationship, their significant other could react by breaking things off or giving them the cold shoulder. In a more established relationship, Advocates’ fear of rejection might manifest in the 

©20112025 NERIS Analytics Limited. https://www.16personalities.com   
16/07/2025, 18:39 Self-Expression, Boundaries, and Love: Advocates (INFJ) and the Discomfort of Speaking Up | 16Personalitiesexpectation that what they have to say will be brushed off, misunderstood, or questioned to the point of dismissal. 

This issue with rejection can – and often does – flow both ways. It’s likely that Advocates also feel discomfort with the idea (or act) of rejecting something that their partner says or does. Chances are they would never want to risk making their partner feel as though they were being rejected, and speaking up or enforcing a boundary might feel like doing exactly that. 

Aversion to Selfishness 

Advocates’ emotional reserve may also be influenced, at least in some respects, by their strong aversion to selfishness – more specifically, to the fact that they generally do not want to be seen as selfish people. Unfortunately, it’s an all-too common and limiting belief that speaking up for yourself and defining boundaries is selfish. Even if someone knows on an intellectual level that this is not true, it can still feel like a selfish act. 

Advocates are among the most self-aware personalities when it comes to acting selfishly in a relationship, and consequently, they’re one of the personality types least likely to report doing so. They tend to feel pretty bad if they think they’ve made a selfish transgression against their partner by exerting their needs. 

Heightened Sensitivity 

The same perceptive sensitivity that makes Advocates such emotionally supportive partners can also hinder them in their self-expression. More so than many other personalities, they can become deeply affected by their partner’s mood and overall energy, possibly to the point of becoming overwhelmed. Rather than feeling the need to speak up, there’s a chance that they’ll feel the need to withdraw. 

This tendency to retreat emotionally can also happen if their own emotions become too much for them to process at once. If their feelings get too intense, it can become hard for Advocates to think clearly – so speaking up in the moment may feel risky in the sense that they might not be able to fully articulate what they are thinking or might say something that they’ll regret later. 

Final Thoughts 

So what can Advocates do with this information? 

Well, you can use it to build self-awareness. If you find yourself pulling back from or walling in your honest thoughts, feelings, and opinions, check in with

16/07/2025, 18:39 Self-Expression, Boundaries, and Love: Advocates (INFJ) and the Discomfort of Speaking Up | 16Personalitiesyourself. What’s holding you back from authentic self-expression? Learn to recognize when your patience and understanding are stretched past the point of tolerance or when you are dancing around your fear of rejection. Tune in to those moments when you feel selfish for advocating for yourself or when your heightened sensitivity fuels your need to retreat. This self-awareness will help you notice when your defenses are up, so that you can intentionally work on lowering them. 

And remember that speaking your mind is one of the best ways to be generous with your partner. It certainly saves them the chore of having to guess what you are thinking or what you need. It might be uncomfortable, but each time you discuss your needs, thoughts, or boundaries, you reveal more of yourself to the person who loves you. In doing so, you create opportunities for the vulnerability and connection that you crave. 

If you’re an Advocate or if you love one, what might you add? What other personality-based tendencies do you think contribute to the emotional reserve that is so common among people with this personality type? Feel free to leave your observations in the comments section below.

Michael Scott vs. Jim Halpert: What   
“The Office” Can Teach Us about   
Comedy and Personality Type 

12 COMMENTS 

“I don’t think of myself as funny – I don’t fill a room with my humor… I would fail miserably as a stand-up comedian.” – Steve Carrell 

Isn’t it funny how some of the most hilarious people we know don’t think of themselves that way? Yet many people who tell lame, offensive, or otherwise awful jokes consider themselves real comedians, ready to go pro? 

Just take actor Steve Carrell, whose comedic talents have graced films ranging from The 40-Year-Old Virgin to Despicable Me, and the fictional office manager who Carrell played in his most famous role – Michael Scott from the mockumentary sitcom The Office. They demonstrate that, in the right hands, a joke can be a work of art and a thing of genius, but in the wrong ones, it can be nothing short of disaster – and there can sometimes be quite a gap between how funny we think we are and how funny other people think we are. 

When we asked our readers to agree or disagree with the statement, “You are good at making others laugh,” we found that 85% of them agreed. Such a strong majority suggests that most of us feel pretty confident in our ability to make people laugh – a broad skill that doesn’t necessarily require delivering stand-up routines on stage or clever one-liners at work. Making someone laugh is often as simple as setting up a silly prank or pulling a funny face at just the right moment. Still, the results show that some personality types are clearly more comfortable with comedy than others.

Which personality types are natural comedians, and which prefer to let others do the joking? Let’s take a look at the data below.

16/07/2025, 20:37 Michael Scott vs. Jim Halpert: What “The Office” Can Teach Us about Comedy and Personality Type | 16Personalities

Diplomats and Analysts (90% and 86% agreeing) 

The Intuitive trait, shared by all Diplomats and Analysts, was a key factor in how likely our readers were to agree that they’re good at making people laugh. Intuitive personality types (89% agreeing) were 8% more likely than Observant types (81%) to agree. Imaginative and creative, Intuitive types are always finding connections that others don’t see, a habit that can lend itself to improvisation and humor. 

Knowing your audience is an essential requirement of effective comedy, and Diplomats, as Feeling personality types, are good at picking up on the emotional dynamics of a situation and reading the moods of those around them. They may love the way laughter can quickly deflate tensions and smooth over disagreements, making Diplomats as quick to tell a joke as they are to offer a shoulder to cry on. 

Of all the personality types, Campaigners were the most likely to agree with our statement, at 97%. Campaigners are always looking on the bright side and wouldn’t hesitate to use humor to cheer up a friend or to bring people together, because they thrive on connecting with others socially and emotionally.

16/07/2025, 20:37 Michael Scott vs. Jim Halpert: What “The Office” Can Teach Us about Comedy and Personality Type | 16PersonalitiesInterestingly, Michael Scott, the bumbling, fictional manager of The Office known for his beloved “That’s what she said” zinger, is a Campaigner personality type. Michael dreams of being a comedian, and while he thinks he’s hilarious, no one else does. Michael seems to be incapable of telling a joke without confusing key details, forgetting the punch line, or offending his audience, and the harder he tries to make people like him, the more disastrous his comedic efforts become. 

He somehow always misses (or chooses to ignore) the awkward silences, rolling eyes, exasperated groans, and HR complaints that his jokes inspire. But at the heart of his many blunders is a genuine desire to build meaningful, personal connections with others and to motivate and entertain his employees. 

Analysts, as Thinking types, are not likely to approach humor as a means of connecting emotionally with others, but rather as a mental exercise. Analysts’ unorthodox but rigorously logical thinking can make them very well-suited to humor. Jokes often draw their power from the mismatch between expectation and reality and serve to highlight the logical flaws in other people’s thinking, or in systems and processes, by making them seem absurd. Sarcasm, satire, and parody are all excellent forms of humor for Analyst personality types. 

Debaters (96%) fell just slightly behind Campaigners in showing the highest rate of agreement in our survey. The same talents that make Debater personalities naturally adept at selling an argument may serve them equally well when it comes time to sell a punch line, especially their flexible, quick wit and their charismatic style. Debaters also love to take positions they don’t actually believe in, just to test a theory, prove a point, or get a laugh. 

This may sound like another character from The Office – Jim Halpert, the bright young salesman who, unchallenged in a job he doesn’t care about, spends most of his energy cracking jokes, making goofy faces, and playing elaborate pranks 

on his coworker Dwight. Like the time he convinced Dwight it was Friday instead of Thursday, or the time he impersonated Dwight for a day, or the time he stole Dwight’s stationery and sent him faxes from his “future self.” Jim is a Debater through and through. 

Explorers and Sentinels (83% and 80%) 

Thanks to their shared Observant trait, Explorers and Sentinels are more down to-earth than Diplomats and Analysts, and they are often more interested in getting practical things done than in creative pursuits like crafting the perfect joke. Although it would be a mistake to characterize these personality types, who also agreed with our statement at high rates overall, as humorless, it may

16/07/2025, 20:37 Michael Scott vs. Jim Halpert: What “The Office” Can Teach Us about Comedy and Personality Type | 16Personalitiesbe true that their thinking is not as conducive to joke telling than their less conventional counterparts. 

Explorers, with their spontaneous Prospecting trait, may excel more at one liners, witty retorts, and other extemporaneous types of humor. Sentinel personality types, for their part, may find comedy to be too frivolous for their tastes more often than not. After all, even the tamest humor has an element of mischief, of poking fun at norms or disrupting order, and Sentinels have a harder time than most in pushing against the lines that they usually work to protect. 

Logisticians (66%) were the least likely personality type to say that they are good at making others laugh. Logisticians take a no-nonsense approach to life, and even among friends and family, they tend not to be playful or spontaneous. That’s not to say they won’t use humor effectively to comfort or entertain those closest to them when a situation calls for it, but most of the time, Logisticians are more interested in practical, logical matters and in living up to their responsibilities. 

Returning to The Office, the one character who never seems to have any sense of humor is Angela Martin, an accountant and a Logistician personality if ever there was one. A laconic stickler for rules who takes everything too seriously, we never see Angela laugh at other peoples’ jokes, let alone tell jokes of her own. The closest she comes to acknowledging some slight appreciation for comedy is during a three-line dinner conversation with Dwight that goes like this: 

Angela: I heard a joke today. 

Dwight: Oh, that’s funny\! 

Angela: Yes. It was.

People Mastery and Social Engagement (93% each agreeing) 

As seems only natural, the Extravert personality trait was the single most influential trait in our survey: Extraverts (93%) were 16% more likely than Introverts (78%) to agree that they’re good at making people laugh. More surprising is that personal self-confidence, as determined by the Identity aspect, had little impact on the results: Assertive types (87%) were just 3% 

more likely than Turbulent types (84%) to agree. 

Thus, we see the People Mastery and Social Engagement Strategies tied for the highest rate of agreement. Sociable and outgoing, Extraverted personality types often feel more comfortable in the spotlight than out of it, which is a vital quality in an entertainer – after all, if a comedian doesn’t appear to enjoy a joke, why 

would their audience? Even in more intimate settings, People Masters and Social Engagers enjoy lifting others’ spirits with their enthusiastic humor, and they are energized in turn by the laughter of those around them. 

Confident Individualism and Constant Improvement (78% and 77%) 

Members of the Confident Individualism and Constant Improvement Strategies were nearly tied in their responses, which are still high, but notably lower than

16/07/2025, 20:37 Michael Scott vs. Jim Halpert: What “The Office” Can Teach Us about Comedy and Personality Type | 16Personalitiestheir Extraverted counterparts. Introverts are certainly more than capable of cracking witty jokes, but they have to work at it more than Extraverts do. Introverted personalities must first get out of their own heads to consider what would make their audience laugh, then they must overcome their hesitation, however strong or slight, to engage with comedy in a social setting. Confident Individualists and Constant Improvers are much more likely to be found sharing their unique sense of humor with a small group of friends than up on a stage in an overstimulating environment with bright lights and noisy crowds. 

Conclusions 

Michael Scott can teach us all something about comedy: it’s a lot harder than it looks. Judging just how far one can push an audience – whether one person or a thousand – without crossing the line between genuine humor and cheesy, absurd, or offensive dreck takes great skill. That’s why personality types who are energetic, creative, and capable of reading others’ emotions, like Extraverted, Intuitive, and Feeling types, tend to be the most comedically inclined – even if they’re not always good at it. 

Of course, making people laugh doesn’t have to be such a high-pressure endeavor. Casual jokes and small, silly moments in our everyday interactions can often be the most meaningful and enjoyable form of humor. Laughter is good for the soul, and even more reserved and serious personality types, like Introverts and Sentinels, can find their own space to relax, feel comfortable joking around, and leave people wanting more. (Cuing Michael Scott: “That’s what she said.”)

Love and Discord: Understanding the ESFJ Approach to Relationship Conflict 

MADISON 0 COMMENTS 

For people with the ESFJ personality type (Consuls), few things are more important than maintaining harmony and stability in their closest relationships. But here’s the thing: no matter how much ESFJs may wish otherwise, conflict is a normal, unavoidable part of relationships. And this is especially true for romantic relationships. 

It’s simply impossible for two people who spend so much time together to be in complete alignment 100% of the time. Differing opinions, needs, and communication styles are bound to create some friction – even in the most successful relationships. So how can ESFJs better navigate relationship conflict in a way that allows them and their relationships to thrive? 

In this article, we’ll unpack how ESFJs tend to approach resolving conflict. We will explore unhealthy ways that these personalities might react to relationship conflict as well as empathetic conflict resolution strategies that they can employ instead. 

To deepen your understanding of healthy and unhealthy responses to conflict, check out our in-depth article “Exploring Relationship Conflict through the Lens of Personality Type.” 

Whether you’re an ESFJ who is seeking to understand your own patterns, someone who is in a relationship with an ESFJ, or someone who is simply curious about how different personality types handle relationship conflict, this

16/07/2025, 18:38 Love and Discord: Understanding the ESFJ Approach to Relationship Conflict | 16Personalitiesexploration promises fresh insights and practical strategies for putting your best foot forward during relationship conflict. 

Harmony Seekers in Conflict 

For ESFJs, relationship conflict is anything but straightforward. Their innate desire for harmony often collides with their practical need to address issues, and this creates a distinct approach to romantic disagreements. This approach is largely shaped by one of their defining characteristics: an acute sensitivity to other people’s emotions. 

Because they are naturally attuned to the emotions of others, ESFJs often pick up on subtle cues and anticipate their partner’s needs before they’re even expressed. However, this sensitivity can also lead to discomfort when their significant other is upset with them. The idea of disappointing or hurting their loved one can be deeply distressing for an ESFJ. 

As a result, ESFJs might downplay their own concerns or avoid bringing up potentially contentious topics in hopes that minor problems will simply resolve themselves without confrontation. However, this peacekeeping tendency can sometimes backfire by causing conflicts to grow more serious and more complicated until they eventually bubble up to the surface – and they always do. 

That said, despite their inclination toward peacekeeping, it’s crucial to note that ESFJs are not completely conflict-averse by nature. In fact, about 76% of ESFJs say they prefer to confront conflicts directly rather than avoiding them, according to our “Relationship Conflict” survey. This statistic reveals an important aspect of ESFJ personalities: when they deem an issue important enough, they are willing and able to address it head-on. 

In essence, ESFJs approach conflicts with a delicate balance of harmony seeking and problem-solving. Their sensitivity to others’ emotions and their desire for peace can sometimes lead to temporary conflict suppression, but their practical nature and deep commitment to their relationships often drive them to confront issues when absolutely necessary. 

Unhealthy Patterns for ESFJs 

While ESFJs are known for their desire for harmony, they can sometimes respond in unhealthy ways when faced with relationship conflict. According to our survey data, people with the ESFJ personality type are especially prone to two such responses: defensiveness and criticism. Both of these responses are 

©20112025 NERIS Analytics Limited. https://www.16personalities.com   
16/07/2025, 18:38 Love and Discord: Understanding the ESFJ Approach to Relationship Conflict | 16Personalitiescommon across the personality spectrum, and they are known to perpetuate problems in romantic relationships. 

For ESFJs in particular, their strong desire for harmony and approval can make conflict feel particularly threatening. As a result, they may use defensiveness as a protective mechanism to shield themselves from perceived attacks on their character or accusations about their efforts in their relationship – which people with this personality type take very seriously. On the other hand, ESFJs might use criticism in an attempt to regain control in a situation that feels too unpredictable or to deflect attention from their own insecurities. 

Ready to take control of your relationships and create healthier dynamics? Discover the power of setting boundaries with our premium e-book Consul Guide to Boundaries. It’s full of insights and advice just for ESFJs like you. 

It is important to note that, even though defensiveness and criticism are natural responses to relationship conflict, they don’t normally help couples reach mutually satisfying conflict resolutions. Defensiveness can shut down open communication and real understanding if one or both parties are not willing to take the time to listen to their partner’s point of view and take responsibility for their part in the conflict. And criticism, especially when it’s habitual, can create a negative atmosphere where one or both partners feel undervalued or constantly under scrutiny. 

One thing that’s particularly interesting about ESFJs is the emotional aftermath that comes from their responses to conflict. After the heat of the moment passes, people with the ESFJ personality type might experience guilt over their defensive or critical behavior. Then, because of their natural inclination to put other people’s needs before their own, they might overcompensate for this guilt by just agreeing with their partner without reaching a mutually beneficial resolution. 

This cycle of conflict, unhealthy responses, guilt, and overcompensation can be exhausting and unproductive when it comes to developing a resilient romantic relationship. It’s key for ESFJs to work on finding a balance, to remember that both points of view in a conflict are usually valid, and to lean into their natural empathy during conflict rather than going on the defensive. 

ESFJ Strengths in Relationship Conflict 

Despite the bad reactions that ESFJs might exhibit from time to time – we are all only human, after all – people with this personality type are equipped with many

16/07/2025, 18:38 Love and Discord: Understanding the ESFJ Approach to Relationship Conflict | 16Personalitiesnatural strengths that often help them respond to conflict in a more empathetic, understanding manner. 

For one thing, ESFJs are usually good communicators. That means that they are able to both express their feelings openly and listen to what their partner has to say. This is hugely important for healthy conflict resolution, as it enables both parties to explain where they are coming from, identify the root causes of a conflict, and reach lasting solutions. 

ESFJs also tend to excel at both meeting their partner halfway and taking responsibility for any part that they’ve played in a conflict. As a matter of fact, ESFJs are the most likely personality type to say they normally take responsibility in some way when conflict arises (at 87%). 

When conflict arises in your relationships, do you usually try to take responsibility for the at hand in some way?

16/07/2025, 18:38 Love and Discord: Understanding the ESFJ Approach to Relationship Conflict | 16PersonalitiesPeople with this personality type have a strong sense of accountability, which often motivates them to acknowledge their own role in the issue at hand. They also tend to be empathetic and deeply committed to their significant other, making it easier for them to readily take responsibility in order to restore peace and strengthen their bonds. 

All in all, ESFJs are the type of people who will do what it takes to create harmony with the people they love, and this definitely comes into play in their responses to conflict. Even in the most heated moments, they are able to remind themselves of why they love the person they’re with, which can help them center themselves, find middle ground, and reach a solution that gets their relationship back on track. 

Final Words 

While ESFJs may sometimes struggle with unhealthy reactions like defensiveness or criticism, their innate strengths often prevail during conflict. The challenge for ESFJs lies in striking a balance between their peacekeeping instincts and their need to address issues directly. By leveraging their natural empathy and dedication to their relationships, while also paying attention to the ways that they can improve, ESFJs can navigate conflicts more effectively and use conflict resolution to foster satisfying, healthy relationships.

How to Move On from a   
Breakup You Didn’t Want 

MADISON 2 COMMENTS 

Most people can agree that going through a breakup really sucks – especially if you didn’t want the breakup in the first place. 

When you lose the person you fell in love with, the person who became one of your best friends and your biggest supporters, it can feel like the whole world loses a bit of its color. It can feel like you’ve somehow been punched in the gut and grabbed by the heart at the same time. And for some people, these feelings can linger much longer than anyone would desire. 

Coming to terms with the grief, the sadness, the anger, the confusion, and all of the other heavy emotions that are likely to bubble up when dealing with a tough breakup is no easy feat. It’s a journey that takes courage, patience, and a whole lot of self-love. And, surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, depending on 

what you already know about the complexities of human personalities, recovering after a breakup is a journey that some personality types report navigating more slowly than others. 

When it comes to moving on after a breakup, to my dismay and the dismay of millions of others around the world, there is no magic spell that we can cast that will take away all of the hurt. So how do people do it? Is it by taking time to heal your broken heart? Is it by finding someone new? Is it by going no contact with your ex and falling in love with yourself? Or maybe it’s by shutting down the part of yourself that feels the pain of the loss? 

In this article, we will explore how different personalities navigate breakups, rejection, letting go, and moving on. And for the people out there who are all up

Keep in mind, this isn’t a process to be rushed by us or anyone else. This is about you healing on your own terms and on your own timeline. 

Why Is It Harder for Some People to Move On? 

There are so many different ways to go about getting over a breakup, and there are also a variety of factors that influence why it’s harder for some people to move on than it is for others. 

For starters, different personalities have different expectations when it comes to how they let other people into their lives. According to our “Relying On Others” survey, where we ask about whether people make conscious efforts to avoid being dependent on others, about 83% of respondents say they generally do try to avoid it. However, only 77% of Feeling personalities try to avoid it, compared to 89% of Thinking personalities. 

Similarly, when responding to the question, “Do you believe life is much easier when you always have someone by your side?” we see that significantly more Feeling types (75% agreeing) report that they do find life easier when they have someone to share it with, compared to Thinking types (just 46% agreeing). 

Thinking and Feeling personalities tend to respond to their relationships and emotions differently. Thinking types might try to view heavy emotions or attachments as things that they can control, while Feeling types might give in to their emotional states with more ease. That’s not to say that Thinking types don’t let themselves fall in love, but they might be more hesitant to let their emotions pull them in one direction or another. 

Thinking and Feeling personality types might also have different innate emotional responses to breakups, separations, and rejections of any kind, and those different responses impact how they perceive a breakup. 

In our “Rejection” survey, we ask whether people typically feel more sad or angry after a rejection. Out of the Feeling personalities who have responded, 84% report feeling more sad, compared to only 16% who feel angry. Out of the Thinking personalities, 57% report that they feel sad, compared to 43% who feel angry. 

That means that Thinking types are significantly more likely than Feeling types to turn to anger when it comes to a breakup. And while it is likely that everyone feels both emotions to some extent when processing a breakup, turning more to anger rather than sadness might just impact whether someone internalizes a

Speaking of moving on, when responding to a question from our “Breakups” survey, 70% of Feeling personalities report that they usually take a long time to recover from a breakup, compared to 43% of Thinking personalities. We see a similar trend with Turbulent and Assertive personalities, with 67% of Turbulent personalities reporting that they take a while to recover from a breakup, compared to 47% of Assertive personalities. 

As someone who is both a Feeling and a Turbulent personality type, I can attest to these statistics. To be more specific, I am a Turbulent Advocate (INFJ-T). And interestingly enough, Advocates are the most likely personality type to report that they take a long time to recover from a breakup, at a whopping 75%. (Lucky us, right?\!) 

Does it usually take you a long time to recover from a breakup?

16/07/2025, 18:40 How to Move On from a Breakup You Didn’t Want | 16PersonalitiesWe see many distinctions in how different personalities respond to breakups. Regardless of your personality type, however, if you happen to find yourself struggling to get over a heartbreak, I am here to remind you to give yourself some grace. 

Moving on after a breakup is really hard\! It can seem like a constant battle between your head and your heart. It might be full of many sleepless nights, intrusive thoughts, unanswered questions, and a wide array of draining emotions that, if you’re anything like me, can weigh heavily on the soul. But hard moments like these are also great opportunities to slow down, reflect on who you are, and show up for yourself with love and compassion as you move through the healing process. 

Letting Go and Moving Forward: 6 Tips for How to Heal from a Breakup 

So, in the spirit of embracing the suck, here are six tips for how to move forward after a breakup that you didn’t want. 

1\. Take It One Day at a Time 

When you’re trying to get over a breakup, it’s important to be patient with yourself. It can be frustrating when you can’t get your ex off your mind or when you aren’t moving on as quickly as you want to. But despite what popular culture might lead you to believe, there is no perfect timeline that can define how long you grieve the relationship that, at one point in time, you wanted with all of your heart. 

It takes time and effort to process the grief that comes from the loss of a relationship that you cherished. It takes time and effort to heal a broken heart and let go of what life used to look like – and what the future could have looked like, had things worked out the way that you wanted them to. This is why you have to take things one day at a time as you try to move forward. In your lowest moments, you might even have to take things one breath at a time. 

In our “Grieving” survey, we ask whether people usually try to speed up the process of grieving as much as they can. Interestingly, 65% of Thinking personalities say they do try to speed up the process, compared to 41% of Feeling personalities. 

This makes sense, considering that Thinking types tend to be more task oriented when it comes to people and emotions. They might view their emotions

16/07/2025, 18:40 How to Move On from a Breakup You Didn’t Want | 16Personalitiesas problems that they can solve through simple steps, rather than as a state of being. And, sometimes, this functions as a very effective strategy. 

However, just because you might try to rush through the grieving process does not mean that you will rid yourself of these emotions completely. Grief has a way of popping back up, whether you like it or not, if you haven’t taken the steps needed to heal. 

2\. Try Not to Internalize the Breakup 

After a breakup, if you’re anything like me, you might start to wonder why you weren’t good enough for the person who ended things with you. This is normal. Not being chosen back is a really hard truth to come to terms with. It can trigger so much doubt and insecurity. It can make you question whether the love that you felt in the relationship was ever real to begin with. But these are feelings and ideas – not facts. 

In our “Breakups” survey, we ask whether people usually consider themselves to be the reason for a breakup. We see that Turbulent personalities are the most likely to say they do, at 65%, followed by Feeling personalities at 63%. Comparatively, 47% of Assertive personalities and 52% of Thinking personalities say they assume the breakup is their fault. 

Across the board, 59% of the people who have responded to this question agree that they think they were at fault for their relationships ending. That’s a lot of people who are blaming themselves for their breakups\! 

And while you have to assume some responsibility for the parts that you played in your breakup, when it comes to romantic relationships, it still takes two to tango. It takes two people who are willing to be honest, communicate with each other, and actively choose each other every day to make a relationship work. If someone decides that they can no longer put in the hard work – or if they take the connection that you have for granted – that has nothing to do with your worth as a person. You are innately worthy. 

3\. Be Honest with Yourself 

Breakups are extremely challenging, but they are also an opportunity to be honest with yourself about the roles that you play in your own suffering and to prioritize your peace. So if you are struggling to move on, it might be time to take a long, hard look in the mirror and ask yourself, “Why?” 

Of course, readjusting to life without the person you love can feel like an uphill battle. But that said, are you doing everything that you can to let go? Are you

16/07/2025, 18:40 How to Move On from a Breakup You Didn’t Want | 16Personalitiesdoing everything that you can to stay rooted in the present? Are you being honest with yourself about both your former relationship and your ex? Are you learning the hard lessons that may come from this experience? Are you showing up for yourself and loving yourself through all of these difficult thoughts and feelings? 

In our “Giving Up and Letting Go” survey, we ask whether it usually takes people a long time to quit something after they realize that they should quit it. Nearly 69% of Feeling personalities report that they do take a long time, compared to 49% of Thinking personalities. In this same survey, we also ask whether people find it easy to accept that they cannot change someone or something. Only 39% of Feeling types think that being unable to change something is easy to accept, compared to 47% of Thinking types. 

The data shows that, in general, Feeling personalities have a harder time letting go and accepting something that they cannot change – even if they know they should. As a Feeling type, I can admit that I’ve always had a hard time letting go of the people I let into my heart, and I can also admit that I haven’t always taken the necessary steps to move on, even when I’m otherwise ready. 

It can be easy to get caught up in the nostalgia of a relationship that meant a lot to you. People tend to look back on the good times and the special moments that made their heart sing, but at the end of the day, no relationship is perfect. And if the relationship ended, it ended for a reason. Taking off the rose-colored glasses and radically accepting the relationship for what it was – the good, the bad, and the ugly – is a very necessary step in moving forward after a breakup. 

4\. Do What You Can to Lift Your Mood 

When you’re going through a breakup, it is imperative that you do what you can to lift your mood and feed your soul when you just cannot stand to live in the hurt any longer. That’s not to say that you should ignore your feelings. There might be days when you don’t want to get out of bed. There might be moments when you aren’t sure if you will ever feel whole again. And that is okay. 

But you are not your emotions, and you are not your thoughts either\! Don’t forget to give yourself a chance to experience the good things that are available to you in your life. 

Listen to the music that you love right when you start your day. Do whatever physical activity you enjoy to get yourself out of your head and into your body. Go for a walk outside. Feel the light from the sun against your skin. Listen to your favorite podcast. Go watch the sunset. Read that book that’s been sitting

16/07/2025, 18:40 How to Move On from a Breakup You Didn’t Want | 16Personalitieson your nightstand forever. Fully invest yourself in a project that inspires you. Spend time with your friends, your parents, your siblings – anyone you love who can remind you that your life is so much bigger than any one relationship. 

Lean into your emotions when you need to and when it feels right. But don’t lose yourself in the past. Every day that you wake up is an opportunity to appreciate the little things that make life so beautiful. 

5\. Invest in Your Other Relationships 

After a breakup, it’s normal to feel lonely. When you lose someone who took up so much space in your day – whether it was the person you woke up next to every morning or the person who asked you how your day was when you got home from work or the person you would call when something went wrong – it can feel like a huge piece of your life is missing. But you have to remember that your life is full of other people who care about you. 

As you try to move forward, you can use the extra free time in your life as an opportunity to work on your other relationships. It’s possible that you’ve invested less attention into your relationships with your friends or your family or your coworkers because you’ve been so caught up in your love story. But there is more to life than being in a romantic relationship. 

Your other relationships deserve just as much time and effort, and your ex isn’t the only person you have to lean on. Breakups are a great time to zoom out and focus on the people who do show up for you and the people who love and accept you unconditionally. 

6\. Work on Your Relationship with Yourself 

Last but not least, one of the best things that you can do after a breakup is take all of that time and energy and attention and love that you put into another person and give it back to yourself. 

This is your time to focus on your hopes and your dreams. It is your chance to explore your inner world, unpack any feelings of unworthiness, and address any unconscious patterns that continue to play out in your relationships with others and your relationship with yourself. It is also your chance to show yourself the same love and compassion that you would have shown to your partner. What small acts of love and kindness can you give to yourself every day as you try to move on? 

Societies so often place an enormous amount of value on being in a romantic relationship. Under that pressure, combined with the pain of the heartbreak, it

16/07/2025, 18:40 How to Move On from a Breakup You Didn’t Want | 16Personalitiescan sometimes feel like being single again is the worst thing in the world. 

But being single gives you the chance to live your life for you again. It gives you the chance to be your own rock and your own safe place, and that is a beautiful thing. After all, the most important relationship that you will ever have is the one that you have with yourself. 

The High Stakes of Love: Embracing Vulnerability and Uncertainty 

Regardless of your personality type, if you’re going through a breakup that you didn’t want, it is safe to say that your heart might be tender for a while. Disappointments in love can be absolutely excruciating. Do what you have to do to take care of yourself, and don’t be afraid to do it at your own pace. 

And as you move forward on your healing journey, always remember that it’s okay that you fell deeply in love. It’s a beautiful thing to fully give your heart to someone, but ultimately, love will always be a risk. It comes and goes. That’s the nature of everything. But love is also all around you and within you. No one can ever take that away from you, if you don’t let them. 

Are you a Feeling or a Turbulent personality type who is having a hard time moving on from a breakup? Or maybe you’re a Thinking or Assertive personality type who just made it to the other side of your heartbreak. Comment below and let us know about your experiences with breakups – the highs, the lows, and everything in between.

RESEARCH AND INSIGHTS 

Self-Interest and Personality   
Type Part II: The Guilt Factor 

8 COMMENTS 

In the first article in this two-part series on self-interest, we examined which personality types are most likely to look after themselves first and put others second. We found that personality types with the Thinking trait – especially Architects (INTJ) – were significantly more likely to do so than those with the Feeling trait – especially Consuls (ESFJ) and Entertainers (ESFP). 

Seeking to explore this topic on a deeper level, we asked our community to agree or disagree with the statement, “You feel guilty whenever you put yourself first.” About two-thirds agreed overall and, as might be expected, the Nature personality aspect was still the most significant in this survey, with a 24% difference between Feeling and Thinking types (76% vs. 52% agreeing, respectively). 

When we introduced emotion – specifically, guilt – into the discussion of self interest, things got more complicated and nuanced, as demonstrated in the chart below.

16/07/2025, 20:24 Self-Interest and Personality Type Part II: The Guilt Factor | 16Personalities

Architects, for example, may be the most likely of all personality types to put themselves first, but they’re also the most likely of all Thinking types to feel guilty about it. What’s going on here? The Mind and Identity personality aspects may hold the key. Let’s take a closer look at the data below.

Diplomats (78% agreeing) 

For Diplomats, making a conscious decision to put themselves first may feel in direct conflict with their values of harmony, cooperation, and equality, not to mention their natural motivation to make others happy. As deeply empathetic, Feeling personality types, Diplomats can’t help thinking about the negative impacts that putting themselves first might have on other people, leading to frequent feelings of guilt. 

This is especially true of Advocates (INFJ), who agreed with our statement more than any other personality type (84%). Advocates care deeply for the welfare of others. These selfless personalities are always working to make a positive difference in the lives of others, and any time they put themselves before their cause, they’re likely to feel guilty, sometimes to an extreme degree. 

Explorers and Sentinels (67% and 66%) 

Just like in our previous study on self-interest, Explorers and Sentinels were strongly divided by the Feeling and Thinking personality traits, but they showed similar overall rates of agreement.

16/07/2025, 20:24 Self-Interest and Personality Type Part II: The Guilt Factor | 16PersonalitiesFor Sentinels, responsibilities to their family and friends, their job, and their community come first. Putting themselves first instead can feel uncomfortable, but these Observant personalities tend to be more realistic than Diplomats about the fact that sometimes it’s simply necessary – even if the majority still feel guilty about it. 

Explorers also tend to be pragmatic about putting themselves first, and they usually don’t get too wrapped up in feelings of regret about the past. But these spontaneous, Prospecting personalities like to live in the moment and are prone to acting first and apologizing later. That instinct may lead to situations where they do come to feel guilty about putting their own interests first. 

Entrepreneurs (ESTP) were the least likely personality type to agree that they feel guilty whenever they put themselves first (47%). Energetic and creative, Entrepreneurs are often focused on bringing their own ideas to fruition. They 

also tend to be risk-takers and thrill-seekers who act without much concern for others’ emotions. It can be easy for Entrepreneurs to take things too far and, as a result, be perceived by others as selfish, and when that happens, guilt may set in. 

Analysts (53%) 

A slight majority of Analysts agreed with our statement. With their core Thinking trait, Analysts make deliberate, rational decisions about when to put themselves first based on what is logical and effective, and they usually see little reason to feel guilty about it. As the least empathetic personalities, Analysts generally feel the least amount of guilt about putting themselves first. 

Architects (INTJ), as previously mentioned, agreed at the highest rate among Thinking personality types (59%), despite having the strongest habit of putting themselves first. It’s possible that, with the frequency or regularity of this habit, guilty feelings might eventually start to accumulate. But this result may have more to do with a sense of social pressure than emotional empathy, as we’ll see in the Strategies section below.

16/07/2025, 20:24 Self-Interest and Personality Type Part II: The Guilt Factor | 16Personalities

Constant Improvement (77% agreeing) 

When it comes to feeling guilty about putting themselves first, Constant Improvers face two challenges. First, as Introverts, these personalities need time to themselves to function well. In a society that values community and socialization, the act of retreating and recharging can be perceived or misunderstood as selfish. Introverts who feel that pressure (like Advocates and Architects) can experience guilt, especially if putting themselves first involves skipping out on plans or otherwise taking a step back from the people they love the most. 

Second, the Turbulent Identity makes Constant Improvers prone to second guessing their decisions. Any time they put themselves first, they may question whether it was the right thing to do and feel guilty about it. Constant Improver personalities tend to be hard on themselves, and a less stable sense of self esteem doesn’t help matters. 

Overall, Introverts were 8% more likely than Extraverts to agree that they feel guilty when they put themselves first (73% vs. 65%), and Turbulent personalities were 13% more likely than Assertive personalities to agree (74% vs. 61%).

16/07/2025, 20:24 Self-Interest and Personality Type Part II: The Guilt Factor | 16PersonalitiesSocial Engagement (71%) 

As Extraverts with the Turbulent personality trait, Social Engagers agreed with our statement in a strong majority, but at a lower rate than Constant Improvers. Whether they’re taking the lead in a group setting or they’re off on an exciting adventure of their own, Extraverts may feel less guilty than Introverts about putting themselves first because they see it as a natural part of engaging with their environment. 

Even so, Turbulent Social Engagers do worry about what other people think of them. Concerns that prioritizing their own interests could make them look overly ambitious or selfish may induce feelings of guilt and self-doubt. 

Confident Individualism (64%) 

Independence, solitude, and self-reliance make up Introverted Confident Individualists’ comfort zone. These Assertive personalities are less likely than their Turbulent counterparts to feel guilty about putting themselves first, partly because they’re more used to it and partly because they worry less in general about other people’s opinions. 

That said, even Confident Individualists can be sensitive to societal pressure, and they’re likely to feel guilty if their tendency to put themselves first creates feelings of disappointment or resentment in their closest friends and loved ones. 

People Mastery (59%) 

Extraverted, Assertive People Masters were the least likely to feel guilty when they put themselves first. People Masters tend to thrive in social situations and shrug off the opinions of others. They’re usually more comfortable taking the lead or otherwise prioritizing their own interests, and they can rely on their strong communication skills when necessary to help others understand these decisions. 

But with a majority of People Masters agreeing with our statement, we see that even these confident personalities can struggle with feelings of guilt when they put themselves first. 

Conclusions 

Guilt is a powerful emotion. It can make normal, even healthy activities – like planning a relaxing evening at home instead of going out with friends or driving the kids around town – feel selfish and wrong.

16/07/2025, 20:24 Self-Interest and Personality Type Part II: The Guilt Factor | 16PersonalitiesIndividuals with the Feeling personality trait, who typically get emotional fulfillment from helping others and acting selflessly, struggle with this the most, and it can be a challenge for Introverts and Turbulent types too. But as this study demonstrates, even the most logical, confident personalities can find it difficult to avoid feelings of guilt when they put themselves first. 

It’s important to keep the subject of self-interest in perspective. Although consistently putting your own self-serving interests ahead of everything else, at all costs, is an ethically and morally questionable approach to life, most people don’t lead this kind of existence. 

In day-to-day life, putting yourself first when you need to is often a positive thing – and sometimes even critical – when it comes to maintaining your own health, well-being, safety, livelihood, and more. Taking time for self-care can in turn be a good thing for your friends, family, and communities too. The next time you’re feeling guilty about putting yourself first, try to keep that in mind.

I Can’t Get No Satisfaction: Satisfaction with Life by Personality Type 

5 COMMENTS 

On our deathbeds, most of us would like to look back on our lives and feel like we have fulfilled most or all of our goals and dreams. Those goals and dreams vary greatly from one individual to another; however, most people agree that purposeful work and positive relationships are the most important components of a meaningful life. 

To determine which personality types feel they are achieving their life goals, we asked our readers to agree or disagree with the statement “When you look back on your life, you are mostly satisfied.”

The more sociable Extraverts were more likely to feel satisfied with their lives, with 76% agreeing, while only 56% of Introverts agreed. Even more important to life satisfaction, however, was Identity. Assertive personality types were 27% more likely to feel satisfied than Turbulent types (with 82% and 55% agreeing, respectively). Let’s examine the results in greater detail, starting with the Role groups.

16/07/2025, 20:40 I Can’t Get No Satisfaction: Satisfaction with Life by Personality Type | 16Personalities

Sentinels (73% agreeing) 

Sentinels are a very satisfied group, largely due to the combination of their Observant and Judging traits. Observant personality types are typically not interested in ruminating on their past or speculating about the future. The present moment is their priority, and Sentinels are unlikely to dwell on the “woulda, coulda, shouldas.” As long as they have checked off most of the tasks that they want to achieve in their lives, and they are continuing to do things that fulfill them, Sentinels are likely to be very satisfied. 

This is especially true for Extraverted and Feeling types, making Consuls (ESFJ) (82%) the personality type most likely to agree that they feel satisfied with their lives. Relationships are priority number one for Consuls, so as long as the relation-ship is sailing smoothly, they are likely to feel pretty content. 

The least satisfied Sentinels were Logisticians (ISTJ) (61% agreeing), and this is likely due to their tendency to dwell, ruminate, and flat-out overthink things. Their Thinking trait can cause them to over-analyze various issues, and the more these personalities analyze and dwell on things, the more problems they are likely to find. Logisticians also tend to be perfectionists, and they can become frustrated and overwhelmed if they believe they have not met their own (often very high) expectations.

16/07/2025, 20:40 I Can’t Get No Satisfaction: Satisfaction with Life by Personality Type | 16PersonalitiesDiplomats and Explorers (66% and 65%) 

The responses from Diplomats and Explorers were similar, data-wise. The Extraverted and Feeling traits are both associated with higher satisfaction in life, and these traits are found in both Role groups. 

Diplomat personality types often utilize their exceptional empathy to pursue work and/or volunteer opportunities that align with their values and ideals. Specifically, Protagonists (ENFJ) (80% agreeing) tend to choose occupations where they can have a positive impact on others and truly make a difference. Combining their Extraverted mind with their Intuitive and Feeling traits, they tend to excel at building meaningful relationships. Protagonists who are able to participate in meaningful ventures and have successful relationships are likely to experience tremendous amounts of satisfaction. 

Virtuosos (ISTP) (54% agreeing) appeared to be much less satisfied with their lives than their fellow Explorers, the Entrepreneurs (ESTP) (76%), which emphasizes the extreme differences between Introverted and Extraverted personality types on the subject of life satisfaction. Virtuosos are incredibly private individuals; they can be difficult to get to know, which makes them unlikely to reach out to others when they’re feeling dissatisfied with their lives. While commitment and emotional connection may be difficult for Virtuosos, those who lack close, meaningful relationships may struggle with feeling lonely or unsupported, leading to lower satisfaction with their lives. 

Analysts (59%) 

The prize for greatest variance between personality types within a specific Role goes to the Analysts. While these four types share a tremendous amount of similarities, the level of satisfaction that they have with their lives is not one of them. Analysts were also the least likely to express feeling mostly satisfied with their lives, which is largely due to their Intuitive and Thinking traits; this combination can cause them to over-analyze their lives. 

Commanders (ENTJ) (74%) reported the greatest amount of life satisfaction of the Analysts. Their primary concern is getting things done as efficiently as possible, often regardless of the consequences. According to Steve Jobs (who was almost certainly a Commander), “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.” Commander personalities will ruthlessly pursue that “great work,” and ultimately, they tend to end up quite satisfied with what they have accomplished.

16/07/2025, 20:40 I Can’t Get No Satisfaction: Satisfaction with Life by Personality Type | 16PersonalitiesSignificantly less likely to feel as satisfied as their fellow Analysts, only 45% of Logicians (INTP) agreed that they felt mostly satisfied with their lives. Like the Commanders, their Intuitive and Thinking traits result in a substantial amount of time (and energy) spent generating ideas and theories. Logicians are perhaps the most analytical of the Analyst personality types, delving into the world of complex and abstract thought with seemingly no effort. Their Introverted and Prospecting traits, however, combine to create a paradox of doubt that can prevent Logicians from achieving a feeling of satisfaction. Their lack of commitment (and confidence) can also prevent them from following through with projects and even relationships, which can lead to greater levels of dissatisfaction.

16/07/2025, 20:40 I Can’t Get No Satisfaction: Satisfaction with Life by Personality Type | 16Personalitiessatisfaction (76% vs. 56%), and Assertive personality types scored 27 points higher than Turbulent types (82% vs. 55%). Both confident and socially adept, People Masters do not need anyone’s permission to feel good about themselves, which makes it much easier to feel tremendously satisfied with what they have achieved in their lives. 

For example, Assertive Protagonists (ENFJ-A) (90% agreeing), being an incredibly idealistic type, are more likely to find an occupation (or volunteer opportunity) that aligns with their values, which is likely a key factor in their high levels of satisfaction. Another crucial component to their satisfaction is related to their high levels of empathy, which they utilize to create harmony and cooperation both in their personal and professional lives, resulting in more fulfilling relationships. 

Assertive Debaters (ENTP-A) (76%) were the least satisfied People Masters, which may be a direct result of their namesake characteristic – debating. While Debaters are generally sociable, these personalities have a tendency to engage in arguments with friends, family members, and co-workers, often purely for fun. This trait, however, becomes less appealing when they challenge others who may not share their enthusiasm for a good argument. This tendency can lead to some strained relationships, which can certainly lead to higher levels of dissatisfaction. 

Confident Individualism (76%) 

Confident Individualists are just that – confident, independent, and not at all concerned with what other people think of them. Not ones to dwell on their mistakes (or worry too much about the future), these individuals don’t spend much time regretting their choices or thinking about what could have been. In fact, most Assertive individuals don’t worry or stress about much at all, which increases their confidence in a big way. 

Assertive Advocates (INFJ-A) (82%), like Assertive Protagonists, are also very idealistic and empathic. Putting their ideals into action means that many Advocates will pursue work or extracurricular activities that align with their values, making them more satisfied with their life choices. Unlike Protagonists, however, Advocates are more likely to become overwhelmed and feel the desire to withdraw from exceptionally stimulating situations. These personalities may not seek out the social support that their Extraverted counterparts do, which may result in feeling less connected and, therefore, less satisfied with life. 

Social Engagement (65%)

16/07/2025, 20:40 I Can’t Get No Satisfaction: Satisfaction with Life by Personality Type | 16PersonalitiesSocial Engagers are perfectionists; however, they often lack the confidence to feel truly satisfied with the results of their hard work. These personality types are especially sensitive to the feedback that they receive from others, as their social status is nearly always at the top of their mind. Turbulent Protagonists (ENFJ-T) (73%) and Consuls (ESFJ-T) (72%) tend to be susceptible to being overly concerned with how others view them, which prevents them from being as satisfied with their lives as their Assertive counterparts. 

Constant Improvement (47%) 

As the name implies, Constant Improvers are always looking for ways to improve, and hopefully perfect, not only their work but their personal lives as well. Their Turbulent identity, however, makes Constant Improvement personality types less confident and more prone to questioning themselves. This may result in restlessness and a lack of satisfaction, because they never feel that the quality of their work is good enough. This is especially true for Turbulent Logicians (INTP-T) (33%) and Virtuosos (ISTP-T) (35%) who, as a result of their Thinking and Prospecting traits, are more likely to second-guess themselves and their life choices. 

Conclusions 

Although Extraverted and Assertive types reported the highest satisfaction with their lives, this does not mean that other personality types cannot achieve a fulfilling or rewarding life. Confidence is key to finding fulfillment, especially when it is used to follow a desired career path, ask out that special someone, or engage in a particularly meaningful creative pursuit. 

Studies have been done that ask people on their deathbed what their biggest regrets are, and it often boils down to “not following my heart.” Keeping in touch with friends and family, spending more time with your spouse and children, pursuing the degree or career that you want rather than the one everyone expects you to get – these are the things that will bring true happiness and satisfaction. 

Are you mostly satisfied with your life? When you think about what you might regret at the end of your life, how does it make you feel? Leave us a comment and let us know\!

ROMANCE 

How to Keep Passion   
Alive by Personality Type 

DARRELL 9 COMMENTS 

Let’s face it: in the absence of passion, our relationships, our work, and our personal endeavors lose momentum. Without at least a spark of passion, commitment and dedication will fizzle out, and simple contentment – although wonderful – may slide into apathy or complacency. Passion is what gives us the emotional energy to apply ourselves, risk rejection, connect deeply with others, and ultimately impact the world. 

Although most of us welcome passion into our lives, it will fade if it isn’t fed and nurtured. Through the process of hedonic adaptation, things that once thrilled us can become old hat. An impassioned love affair might lose its luster. A dream career can turn into a daily grind. Hobbies that were once an obsession may now gather dust in the corner. 

When passions fade, we might have to move on and accept that a chapter of our lives is closing. But at other times we need to reinvigorate our passion so that we don’t lose something – or someone – deeply important to us. By learning about how different personality types generate enthusiasm, motivation, and meaning, we can strategize how best to keep our passions alive. 

In this article, we’ll explore ways to recover from burnout, kick complacency, and resuscitate the passions that enrich our lives. So what can the study of personality types teach us about restoring passion? Let’s find out.

16/07/2025, 18:52 How to Keep Passion Alive by Personality Type | 16PersonalitiesAnalysts 

Rational to the core, Analyst personality types find their passion in exploring systems and engaging with big-picture questions. They enjoy accumulating knowledge, spotting unexpected patterns and connections, and using their insights to achieve a better – well, anything. For Analysts, burnout occurs when there is nothing left to discover and when their intellectual freedom is curtailed. Given their pioneering spirit, these personalities need the latitude to pursue their interests on their own terms. 

When Analysts experience burnout, it is time for them to step back and look at the big picture of their efforts. What grand challenge can they tackle at work? How can their efforts disrupt current paradigms and usher in positive change? 

What new mysteries can they explore with their romantic partners? By reframing their daily activities and interactions in terms of intellectual and personal discovery, Analysts can renew their appreciation of their work and their relationships. 

Analyst passion question: How can this task or relationship contribute to a big-picture discovery? 

Diplomats 

Even typically passionate Diplomat personalities can lose their spark. The everyday and the ordinary won’t sustain their passion – whether in a job that feels repetitive or in an intimate relationship that has lost its romantic flourish. Diplomats crave novelty and growth, and they will feel disconnected or stagnant if their work and relationships don’t leave room for dreaming and creativity. As with Analysts – their fellow Intuitive personality types – Diplomats lose steam unless they can honor their powerful imaginations, expanding old visions and embarking on new ones. 

Diplomats need to “renew their vows” often – both with their professions and with their relationships. When these personality types feel stuck or burnt out, they should write mission statements, create vision boards, and compose love letters that create a vision for the future. 

Perhaps more than any other Role, Diplomats need to regain their spark on an emotional level, not just a practical level. Discipline, productivity, plans, and schedules can only carry them so far. These personalities are reformers, and whether they prioritize personal growth or social activism, they need to honor their idealistic fire in order to maintain their passion.

Sentinels 

Passionate about order and accomplishing what they set out to do, Sentinel personality types can be zealous even about work that most of us would consider tedious – as long as they believe there is a purpose to it. In fact, the ordinary world can be quite a comfort to people with this Role. Sentinels connect to their passion by serving as a stabilizing influence, both at work and at home. Driven by loyalty rather than praise, they are unlikely to seek the acclaim of others, but they still want to be noticed for what they do. If these personalities sense they are being taken for granted, they are at risk of losing their enthusiasm. 

Sentinels can restore their passion by reaffirming their place in the grand scheme of things. It might help them to imagine themselves as the lead in the film It’s a Wonderful Life. What would their world be like without them? How would the people in their lives be affected? What social groups would crumble without them, and what projects at work would fall apart? 

Like George Bailey in the film, Sentinels bind together the people in their lives, and the world would be a colder, more chaotic place if they didn’t exist. By appreciating the meaningful influence they have in their personal and professional spheres, Sentinel personality types can spark their inner fires again. 

Sentinel passion question: How am I essential to the world around me? 

Explorers 

Explorers live to take action, and they love making and fixing things. Passion, for many of them, involves swooping in and saving the day with their skills. These personality types enjoy few things better than showing the results of their handiwork, but they rarely sit on their laurels. After the first rush of pleasure that they get from a hard-won accomplishment, Explorers feel the urge to move on and experience more. If they feel stuck, confined, or controlled by others, their passion will be stifled. Even pleasant routines can become trying for Explorers, whose worst nightmare is to experience the same thing over and over again.

16/07/2025, 18:52 How to Keep Passion Alive by Personality Type | 16PersonalitiesAs you might have guessed from their name, Explorer personalities reinvigorate their passion by exploring. They need to discover new challenges to tackle, new sensations to experience, and new ways to master their skills. In relationships, they should regularly identify new ways to connect with the person they care about. This may entail taking on new activities, traveling to new places, or creating new memories together. 

Keeping a relationship fresh is important for everyone, but perhaps even more for Explorer personality types than for other Roles. Above all, Explorers’ enthusiasm will be bolstered if they know that they can freely head out in new directions and chart new waters – whether on their own or with the person they love. 

Explorer passion question: What new terrain can I explore from this vantage point? 

Extraverts and Introverts 

Passion is emotional energy, and its role in your life will also be influenced by your degree of Extraversion or Introversion. Extraverted personality types gain energy by turning outward and engaging with other people. As a result, an Extravert is more likely to bolster their passion by experiencing strong external stimuli and interacting with others. Their passion may even be triggered by a group effort, such as a team event, a party, or a fundraiser. 

On the other hand, Introverts get energy by turning inward and attuning to their own counsel. When they’ve lost interest in the things that matter to them, these personalities may want to retreat on their own or spend time with a few trusted 

people. The key to reinvigorating their passion will likely lie in something they discover within themselves. 

Extravert passion question: What event, experience, or social interaction would refresh my energy? 

Introvert passion question: When can I carve out time to reflect on the situation at hand and clarify my priorities? 

Conclusions 

When we need to reinvigorate our passion, our personality type can guide us where to look. In short, Analysts should cultivate a sense of discovery, Diplomats should chart a course toward a better future, Sentinels should

Introverts should create time and space for reflection, and Extraverted personalities should seek out conversations and experiences that will reinvigorate them. 

Of course, we don’t always need to experience passion. In fact, it would be unrealistic to expect to feel impassioned all of the time. That said, sometimes our work, our personal projects, or our relationships need a kickstart. Fortunately, when we need to restart our engines, we can turn to insights from the study of personality types to get back into gear.
