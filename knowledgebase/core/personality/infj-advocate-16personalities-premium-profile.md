What's in This Profile? This profile is designed to cover the main
aspects of Advocates' personality as it affects different areas of their
life, including Advocates' key strengths and weaknesses, relationships,
academic path, career and professional development, as well as their
communication and friend-making skills, parenting tips and advice, and
much, much more. It combines personality-type theory with practical,
real-world advice from other people who share the Advocate personality
type. Personality type has been the focus of many discussions, some of
them dating back to ancient times. It's wise to draw from this source of
knowledge and experience, especially when unsure of how to handle a
specific situation. This kind of knowledge offers the power to control
and understand oneself. As Aristotle said millennia ago, "The hardest
victory is the victory over self." Consider this profile a plan for
success.

The Puzzle of Personality

When they receive their personality test results on our website, most
people's first question is, "What do these letters mean?" We are of
course referring to those mysterious acronyms -- INTJ-A, for example, or
ENFP-T. As you may have already learned from the type descriptions or
articles on the website, the five letters of these acronyms each refer
to a specific trait, with certain trait combinations forming various
types and type groups. But before we discuss those traits in depth,
let's explore their historical foundations. Since the dawn of time,
humans have drawn up schematics to describe and categorize our
personalities. From the four temperaments of the ancient civilizations
to the latest advances in psychology, we have been driven to fit the
variables and complexities of human personality into well-defined
models. Although we are still some time away from being able to do that,
the current models account for our most important personality traits and
can predict our behavior with a high degree of accuracy.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

The Puzzle of Personality

Personality is just one of many factors that guide our behavior,
however. Our actions are also influenced by our environment, our
experiences, and our individual goals. This profile describes how people
belonging to a specific personality type are likely to behave. We will
outline indicators and tendencies, however, not definitive guidelines or
answers. Significant differences can exist even among people who share a
personality type. The information in this profile is meant to inspire
personal growth and an improved understanding of yourself and your
relationships -- not to be taken as gospel. Our approach has its roots
in two different philosophies. One dates back to the early 20th century
and was the brainchild of Carl Gustav Jung, the father of analytical
psychology. Jung's theory of psychological types is perhaps the most
influential creation in personality typology, and it has inspired many
different theories. One of Jung's key contributions was the development
of the concept of Introversion and Extraversion -- he theorized that
each of us falls into one of these two categories, either focusing on
the internal world (Introvert) or the outside world (Extravert). Besides
Introversion and Extraversion, Jung coined the concept of so-called
cognitive functions, separated into Judging or Perceiving categories.
According to Jung, each person prefers one of these cognitive functions
and may most naturally rely on it in everyday situations. In the 1920s,
Jung's theory was noticed by Katharine Cook Briggs, who later coauthored
one of the most popular personality indicators used today, the
MyersBriggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®). Briggs was a teacher with an avid
interest in personality typing, having developed her own type theory
before learning of Jung's writings. Together with her daughter, Isabel
Briggs Myers, they developed a

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

6

The Puzzle of Personality

convenient way to describe the order of each person's Jungian
preferences -- this is how four-letter acronyms were born. Of course,
this is just a very simplified description of the Myers-Briggs theory.
Readers interested in learning more should read Gifts Differing:
Understanding Personality Type by Isabel Briggs Myers. As we define
personality traits and types differently in our model, we will not go
deeper into Jungian concepts or related theories in this profile. Due to
its simplicity and ease of use, the four-letter naming model is now
shared by a number of diverse theories and approaches, including
Socionics, Keirsey Temperament Sorter®, and Linda Berens' Interaction
Styles, among many others. While the acronyms used by these theories may
be identical or very similar, however, their meanings do not always
overlap. As a result, if you meet five people who say, "I am an INFJ,"
their understanding of what that means may vary significantly.
Regardless of its structure, any type-based theory will struggle to
describe or characterize people whose scores lie near the dividing line.
A different way to look at personalities is through the lens of a
trait-based rather than a type-based model. What do we mean by that?
Instead of creating an arbitrary number of categories and attempting to
fit people within them, a trait-based model simply studies the degree to
which people exhibit certain traits. You may have heard the term
Ambivert, which is a perfect example in this case. Ambiversion means
that someone falls in the middle of the Introversion-Extraversion scale,
being neither too outgoing nor too withdrawn. Trait-based theories would
simply say that an Ambivert is moderately Extraverted or moderately
Introverted and leave it at that, without assigning a personality type.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

The Puzzle of Personality

A trait-based approach makes it easier to reliably measure correlations
between personality traits and other characteristics -- for example,
political attitudes. This is why trait-based approaches dominate
psychometric research, but that's more or less the only area where these
approaches are dominant. Because they don't offer types or
categorizations, trait-based theories don't translate as well as
type-based theories into specific recommendations and takeaways.
Assigned categories such as Extravert or Introvert may be limiting, but
they allow us to conceptualize human personality and create theories
about why we do what we do -- something that a more scientifically
reliable but colorless statement, such as you are 37% Extraverted,
simply cannot do. With our model, we've combined the best of both
worlds. We use the acronym format introduced by Myers-Briggs for its
simplicity and convenience, with an extra letter to accommodate five
rather than four scales. However, unlike Myers-Briggs or other theories
based on the Jungian model, we have not incorporated Jungian concepts
such as cognitive functions, or their prioritization. Jungian concepts
are very difficult to measure and evaluate scientifically, so we've
instead chosen to rework and rebalance the dimensions of personality
called the Big Five personality traits, a model that is very popular in
psychological and social research. Our personality types are based on
five independent spectrums, with all letters in the type code
(e.g. INFJ-A) referring to one of the two sides of the corresponding
spectrum. We'll talk more about these concepts in the next chapter. This
approach has allowed us to achieve high test accuracy while also
retaining the ability to define and describe distinct personality types.
During the last few years, we have conducted more than 800 studies to
uncover trends and correlations between personality traits and various
behaviors. Many of

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

The Puzzle of Personality

these studies will be referenced in this profile, and additional
information can be found in our online Academy. Our goal is to give you
access to our sources without repeating ourselves or overwhelming you
with information. If you are particularly interested in a specific study
or its statistical characteristics, please feel free to contact us via
our website, and we will do our best to provide additional information.
With that aside, let's dig deeper into the five personality aspects!

Five Personality Aspects Mind: Introverted (I) vs. Extraverted (E) The
distinction between Introverts and Extraverts may be the oldest notion
in the history of personality theories. It has long been observed that
some people are expressive and outgoing, while others are reserved,
quiet, and more comfortable alone. The first group recharges by engaging
with the external world and communicating with other people, whereas
members of the second group are energized by spending time alone and
connecting with their own inner world. We focus on these differences in
our first scale, which we call Mind. This scale -- which is based on a
person's level of expressiveness and the degree to which he or she seeks
external stimulation -- determines how we see and approach the outside
world, including people, objects, and activities. This scale correlates
with a number of other personality traits, such as willingness to
volunteer, desire to engage in thrill-seeking activities, and romantic
assertiveness, to name just a few.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

The Puzzle of Personality

On one side of this scale, we have Introverted individuals (the I letter
in the

type

acronym).

You

might

associate Introversion with being private or withdrawn -- or even clumsy
or antisocial -- but our studies show a far more complex picture.
Generally speaking, Introverts do not seek or require much external
stimulation. As you might expect, an Introvert requires less
communication with others than an Extravert would, but an Introvert's
preference for less stimulation can also influence his or her hobbies,
political attitudes, and even eating or drinking habits. To give a
practical example, our studies have found that Introverts are less
likely than Extraverts to enjoy coffee and energy drinks. But

Extraverts?

with

Introverts,

Extraverts are more interested in engaging with the people, objects, and
environment around them. This preference manifests itself in many ways:
Extraverts are less sensitive than Introverts to noise, for example, and
they are likelier to wear bright and colorful clothes. Extraverts not
only tolerate external stimuli, however; they actually need these
stimuli in order to support their own energy.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

10

The Puzzle of Personality

Extraverts are often energetic and willing to take the lead, especially
in social situations. They enjoy pushing themselves to the limit and
challenging themselves and those around them. Unlike Introverts, who are
more cautious in their approach, Extraverts are likely to feel that they
can handle life's challenges without much forethought. Whether that
turns out to be true depends on many other circumstances, but overall,
Extraverts tend to be more proactive in experiencing -- and embracing --
the world around them. Worldwide, the three most Extraverted countries
are Oman (61.66%), Yemen (59.44%), and Saudi Arabia (58.95%). The most
Introverted countries are Japan (59.88%), Lithuania (55.85%), and
Portugal (54.25%). In the United States, New York (50.92%), Mississippi
(50.87%), and Illinois (50.64%) top the list for Extraverts, while West
Virginia (53.62%), Alaska (53.6%), and Maine (53.41%) report the highest
percentages of Introverts. Interestingly, if the District of Columbia
were included in the comparisons, it would easily top the Extraverted
list. In our study, the average Extraversion score for the capital
city's 23,310 respondents was 53.06% -- significantly above New York,
its closest competitor. Advocates are Introverted. This is why they
enjoy being self-sufficient, prefer working with ideas rather than
people, and don't need great numbers of friends. They may even be able
to tune out what is happening around them. Socializing depletes
Advocates' internal energy reserves quite quickly, and when that
happens, they need to return to their home base to recharge. Again,
these are just tendencies and not predestined, unchangeable traits. For
instance, Advocates are perfectly capable of honing their social skills
and becoming experts in negotiation or small talk. Advocates would
develop these skills out of necessity, however, and not due to
particular enthusiasm or interest.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

The Puzzle of Personality

Energy: Intuitive (N) vs. Observant (S) Energy is the second scale in
our model, and in our opinion it is the most important. While the other
four scales determine how you interact with the world (Mind), make
decisions (Nature), schedule your activities (Tactics), or react to
external feedback (Identity), the Energy scale actually determines how
you see the world and what kind of information you focus on. All
personality types can be divided into those that favor the Intuitive
energy style and those that favor the Observant energy style. Intuitive
individuals tend to be visionary, interested in ideas and abstractions,
and attracted to novelty. Observant individuals, on the other hand,
prefer facts, concrete and observable things, and the tried and true. It
is important to stress that this scale has nothing to do with how we
absorb information: Intuitive and Observant types use their five senses
equally well. Instead, this scale shows whether we focus on what is
possible (making connections intuitively) or what is real (observing the
environment). If you are familiar with the Big Five personality traits,
you might recognize this scale as a reworking of the openness to
experience concept, with a focus on preference for (and tolerance of)
novelty and ambiguity. Individuals with the Intuitive trait rely on
their imaginations and think in terms of ideas and possibilities. They
dream, fantasize, and question why things happen the way they do, always
feeling slightly detached from the actual, concrete world. Although they
observe other people and events, their minds remain directed both
inwards and somewhere beyond -- always questioning, wondering, and
making

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

12

The Puzzle of Personality

connections. When all is said and done, Intuitive types believe in
novelty, in the open mind, and in never-ending improvement. In one
16Personalities study, we asked people whether they wish they had been
born in the Age of Discovery (roughly speaking, the 15th through the
18th centuries). Our results showed that Intuitive types were much more
willing to give up the convenience, comfort, and predictability of
modern life in exchange for the excitement of exploration, distant
civilizations, and the undiscovered mysteries of the New World. In
contrast, individuals with the Observant trait focus on the actual world
and things happening around them. Preferring to see, touch, feel, and
experience, they are happy to leave theories and possibilities to
others. They keep their feet on the ground and focus on the present,
instead of wondering why or when something might happen. Consequently,
people with this trait tend to be better at dealing with facts, tools,
and concrete objects as opposed to brainstorming, theorizing about
future events, or handling abstract theories. Observant types are also
significantly better at focusing on just one thing at a time instead of
juggling multiple activities.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

13

The Puzzle of Personality

The Energy scale influences communication style as well. Intuitive
individuals talk about ideas and have no difficulties with allusions or
reading between the lines, while Observant types focus on facts and
practical matters. This is why Intuitive types may find it challenging
to understand someone with the Observant trait, and vice versa.
Intuitive types may think that Observant individuals are materialistic,
unimaginative, and simplistic, and Observant types may see their
Intuitive conversation partner as impractical, naïve, and absent-minded.
These assumptions and biases can be quite damaging, and it takes a
mature person to get past them. Geographically, the Middle East and Asia
have the largest percentage of Observant individuals, with 8 countries
in the top 10 list. Saudi Arabia (71.94%), Oman (71.03%), and Yemen
(69.76%) have the top scores among Observant countries, while Nepal
(48.92%), Albania (48.51%) and Maldives (48.44%) top the Intuitive
table. In the United States, North Dakota (59.43%), Minnesota (59.23%),
and Iowa (59.04%) are the most Observant states. On the opposite side of
the table, we have Nevada (43.92%), Rhode Island (43.75%), and West
Virginia (43.47%). Advocates are Intuitive individuals. This is why they
are so good at seeing possibilities and honoring different points of
view. People with this personality type spend more time engaging in
various internal discussions than observing things around them.
Advocates are not that concerned about what is happening; instead, they
focus on what might happen or why something has happened. Advocates hone
this focus throughout their lives, which makes them passionate and
insightful thinkers. Of course, every stick has two ends, and focus on
novelty and change comes at a cost. By directing their mental resources
toward possibilities and the future, Advocates inevitably lose sight of
what is happening around them. They may have difficulties

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

14

The Puzzle of Personality

dealing with practical matters or data. If they aren't paying attention,
they may even miss something right under their nose. Because the
majority of the population has the Observant trait, Advocates may have
difficulty finding a partner and connecting with others.

Nature: Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F) The third scale, which we call
Nature, determines how we make decisions and cope with emotions. While
we all have feelings, there are significant differences in how different
types react to them. This scale influences a number of areas of our
lives, particularly our interactions with other people. People with the
Thinking trait seek logic and rational arguments, relying on their head
rather than their heart. They do their best to safeguard, manage, and
conceal their emotions. "Whatever

happens,

you

must

always keep a cool head" -- this is the motto of Thinking individuals.
These types are not cold-blooded or indifferent, however. People with
the Thinking trait are often just as emotional as those with the Feeling
trait, but they subdue or override their feelings with their rational
logic. In several of our studies, we analyzed the attitudes of different
personality types toward philanthropy and charitable causes. Thinking
types are significantly less likely to engage in charitable giving or to
be touched by charities' emotional appeals. Does this mean that they are
unwilling to help? Not necessarily. It turns out that Thinking "The
Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

15

The Puzzle of Personality

personalities don't believe that giving money to charity is the best way
to make a difference. They may look for other ways to be of assistance
-- for example, investing in education for the disadvantaged. In
contrast, people with the Feeling trait follow their hearts and care
little about hiding their emotions. From their perspective, we should
not be afraid to listen to our innermost feelings and share them with
the world. These individuals tend to be compassionate, sensitive, and
highly emotional. They would rather cooperate than compete, although
they are not naïve or easily swayed. In fact, people with the Feeling
trait are likely to fight tooth and nail for their values and beliefs.
For many Feeling types, principles and ideals are much more important
than, say, professional success. Although this perspective might not
seem rational, Feeling types generally adhere to their own highly
individualized -- and perfectly valid -- logic. Worldwide, Iran
(51.91%), Georgia (50.74%), and Albania (48.94%) report highest scores
on the Thinking side of the scale. On the Feeling side, we have
Singapore (61.41%), Australia (60.1%), and New Zealand (59.98%). In the
U.S., northern states tend to be slightly more Feeling, but not
significantly so. One interesting example is the contrast between Utah
and Nevada: two neighboring states that are each first on opposite sides
of the scale. In Utah, the average score is 61.19% on the Feeling side,
well above Minnesota (59.61%) and Idaho (59.54%), which

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

16

The Puzzle of Personality

take second and third place, respectively. Nevada, on the other hand, is
the most Thinker-heavy state in our study, with its 34,576 respondents
getting an average score of 42.99% on the Thinking side of the spectrum.
While that still means Feeling personality types outnumber Thinking
types significantly, we rarely see such differences between neighboring
regions. Other top Thinking states include Delaware (42.71%) and New
Mexico (42.7%). Advocates have the Feeling trait -- they trust and
prioritize feelings, relying on moral and ethical arguments, and doing
everything they can to stay true to their deeply held principles. People
with this personality type are kind and sensitive, always able to find
something positive regardless of the circumstances. The Intuitive and
Feeling traits form the core of the Advocate personality, making them
very insightful, idealistic and open-minded individuals, capable of
amazing feats, especially in fields related to morality, philosophy or
diplomacy. However, they also push Advocates away from the majority of
the population, sometimes making it difficult for them to relate to
other people, especially when it comes to accepting what they see as
egoism and self-interest.

Tactics: Judging (J) vs. Prospecting (P) The Tactics scale determines
how we approach planning and how we handle available options. The
implications reach well beyond our calendars, however. At its core, this
scale determines our attitudes toward certainty and structure in our
lives. People with the Judging trait do not like to keep their options
open. They would rather prepare five different contingency plans than
wait for challenges to arise. These individuals enjoy clarity and
closure, always sticking to the plan rather than going with the flow.
It's as if Judging types keep a mental checklist, and once a decision is
"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

17

The Puzzle of Personality

crossed off that list, it is not open to reassessment. This mentality
applies as much to grocery shopping as it does to life goals, like
buying a house. Individuals with the Judging trait tend to have a strong
work ethic, putting

their

duties

and

responsibilities above all else. Our research indicates that Judging
types are also strict when it comes to law and order. Of course, this
doesn't mean that Prospecting individuals are lawbreakers, but if you
see someone go out of his or her way to use a crosswalk, that person is
likely a Judging type. In contrast, Prospecting individuals are flexible
and relaxed when it comes to dealing with both expected and unexpected
challenges. They are always scanning for opportunities and options,
willing to jump at a moment's notice. People with this trait understand
that life is full of possibilities, and they are reluctant to commit to
something that might prove an inferior option in the future. They also
focus more on what makes them happy than what their parents, employers,
or teachers expect. If a specific task is not particularly important

or

interesting,

a

Prospecting individual will always come up with something better to do.
Looking at the geographical data, the global Judging-Prospecting chart

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

18

The Puzzle of Personality

has interesting similarities with the Extraverted-Introverted one. While
these scales do not influence each other from a statistical perspective,
many of the countries topping the Extraverted-Introverted charts have
correspondingly high JudgingProspecting scores. At the top of the
Judging table we have Oman (58.05%), Yemen (57.78%), and Kuwait (55.8%),
while the most Prospecting countries are Japan (55.21%), Nepal (53.74%),
and Lithuania (53.62%). The map of the United States, however, does not
show significant overlaps between these two scales. On the Judging side
of the spectrum, we have South Carolina (51.05%), Alabama (50.97%), and
Tennessee (50.8%). On the other side, the most Prospecting states are
Alaska (51.2%), Vermont (50.86%), and West Virginia (50.76%). Advocates
are Judging individuals -- they are decisive and usually find it
difficult to cope with uncertainty and unpredictability. This is what
makes them not just natural visionaries, but also implementers, both
willing and able to dedicate time to making sure that their ideas come
to life. That being said, people with this personality type aren't too
meticulous or rule-bound -- they seek closure, but don't obsess over
tiny details or procedures. Advocates are idea people rather than
logisticians.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

The Puzzle of Personality

Identity: Assertive (-A) vs. Turbulent (-T) The last scale, Identity,
affects all others, reflecting how confident we are in our abilities and
decisions. In a way, this scale acts as an internal sensor, reacting to
the input we get from our environments -- for instance, success or
failure, feedback from others, or pressure caused by unexpected events.
The Mind and Identity scales are the alpha and the omega of our model,
acting as an external shell that we wear in all of our interactions with
the outside world. Later, we will discuss the four possible combinations
of these traits, which we call "Strategies," but in the meantime, let's
take an in-depth look at the Identity scale. Assertive

individuals

are

self-

assured,

even-tempered,

and

resistant to stress. They refuse to worry too much, and they don't push
themselves too hard when it comes to achieving goals. Similarly, they
are unlikely

to

spend

much

time

thinking about past actions or choices. According to Assertive types,
what's done is done and there is little point in analyzing it. Not
surprisingly, people with this trait are generally satisfied with their
lives, and they feel confident in their ability to handle challenging
and unexpected situations. In contrast, Turbulent individuals are
self-conscious and sensitive to stress. They experience a wide range of
emotions and tend to be success-driven, perfectionistic, and eager to
improve. Always feeling the need to do more, have more, and be more,

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

20

The Puzzle of Personality

Turbulent types may forget how exhausting this dissatisfaction can be --
both for themselves and for the people around them. While the Assertive
variant may seem more positive on the surface, that is not necessarily
the case. Turbulent

individuals

are

more

willing than Assertive types to change jobs if they feel stuck in their
current roles, and they think deeply about the direction of their lives.
Turbulent individuals may also outperform Assertive types in certain
instances, because they may care more about the outcome. The willingness
of Turbulent types to push themselves may ultimately enable them to
achieve their goals. Worldwide, Japan is by far the most Turbulent
country, with an average score of 57.48% on the Turbulent side. Italy
(53.8%) and Brunei (52.89%) come in second and third, respectively. On
the Assertive side of the spectrum, we have Uganda (57.91%), Barbados
(57.11%), and Nigeria (57.01%). In the United States, there is a clear
east-west divide, with the East Coast being significantly more
Turbulent. West Virginia (49.3%) takes the lead on the Turbulent side,
followed by Rhode Island (48.84%) and Maine (48.73%). The most Assertive
states are New Mexico (54.7%), Colorado (54.66%), and Hawaii (54.28%).

Type Groups Now you know what each type consists of. But how do they fit
together?

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

21

The Puzzle of Personality

Our system has two layers: the first (inner) one defines our Roles, the
second (outer) one, our Strategies.

Roles The Role layer determines our goals, interests, and preferred
activities. Each of the four Roles covers a set of personality types
that are very similar, and we will use these groups later in this
profile to draw contrasts and similarities between personalities. They
also serve to highlight the importance we have placed on the Energy
trait. Each personality type will share either the Observant or the
Intuitive trait with all other members of their group, as well as one
other key trait. Advocates belong to the Diplomat Role group, along with
three other personality types: Mediators, Protagonists, and Campaigners.

Analysts Shared traits: Intuitive and Thinking The personality types in
the Analyst Role -- Architects, Logicians, Commanders, and Debaters --
embrace rationality, excelling in intellectual and technological
pursuits. The Thinking trait makes Analysts exacting, and the Intuitive
trait lets them apply their minds to almost anything, with their
imaginations aiding calculated, strategic thinking, or seeing just how
far the rabbit hole goes with a crazy scheme or thought experiment.
These personalities are driven to understand and create, and have no
problem switching between speculative musing and frank,
solutions-oriented approaches to whatever problems are at hand. Broad,
intelligent vision gives Analysts an ingenious

air, but they can become overwhelmed and scattered if they don't learn
to hone these abilities and use them to advance a worthwhile cause or
project. The biggest pitfall is that their intellect can give them a
false sense of accomplishment. They tend to prefer the world of ideas to
the sober reality of follow-through, and by assuming the role of critic
instead of participant, Analysts sometimes risk being functionally
outpaced by those who simply sit down and do the work. They can earn
themselves the unsavory title of "armchair analysts" while those with
more real-world experience continue to create real results. Analyst
personality types can lack a proper respect for those of simpler vision
and expression, whatever their background, and it can hold them back.
Analysts value their intellect above all else, and it can be a challenge
convincing them it's worth checking their many hypotheses with an
experiment or proper evidence to be sure. To many Analysts, if something
makes sense in their minds, that's as good as proved, and a great deal
faster. Analysts can be brilliant, but they're still human; under the
influence of ego, these personality types can get in the habit of
advancing clever opinions instead of objective facts. Analysts' positive
self-identity stems largely from their formidable drive to learn, and
their clever and sharply witty banter can make them excellent debate
partners. Often insatiable readers as well, Analysts can be found
stockpiling books, questioning teachers, and driving conversations in
forums across the world wide web. These types prefer their own processes
and pace, and are energized by exercising their minds on their own time.
Analysts are also relentless self-improvers. Once they've recognized a
flaw, they apply all of this cold rationality, honest reflection,
imagination, and desire for results

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

23

The Puzzle of Personality

to make it right. Analysts' forceful, imaginative vision, when trained
and focused, enables these personalities to conceive and accomplish
things most thought impossible.

Diplomats Shared traits: Intuitive and Feeling Diplomats -- Advocates,
Mediators, Protagonists, and Campaigners -- tend to be warm, caring, and
generous individuals, shining in diplomacy and counselling. These
personality types promote cooperation and harmony, tolerating discord
only as a step towards positive change. Their perceptive abilities
seemingly go deeper than the traditional senses -- it's as if they have
a full set of tuning forks in their hearts that can resonate with
people's emotional states, and this empathetic sensitivity creates deep
connections with others. This is not as mystical as it can seem.
Diplomat personalities deeply value understanding, and a lifetime of
self-reflection grants them insights into others' motivations that they
might not even understand themselves. Diplomats can use this to shape
the way others feel, but it would be out of character for them to use
this for ill. Diplomats' people skills nurture friendship and healing
with pure, genuine empathy. Causing distress feels to them like wounding
their own psyche, so they prefer to gently nudge loved ones and
strangers alike in a positive direction. Diplomats find the ideals of
humanism rewarding: kindness, understanding, altruism, and growth warm
them like a bonfire on a chilly autumn day. These personality types
envision a prismatic, kind world.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

24

The Puzzle of Personality

The Intuitive trait plays a big part in this optimism, but it also makes
Diplomats sensitive to injustices that would jeopardize that ideal
world. They can be aggressive against forces they perceive as evil, and
are capable of steely action when they feel they have moral high ground.
Diplomats' sensitive emotions may flare to outright combativeness if
provoked; with self-righteous momentum and weighty ideals, these
personality types can steamroll others. If they let inspiration trump
rationality unchecked, they can sometimes go too far, damaging the very
causes they hold dear, however justified the outrage. Tempering this
passion with cold practicality is a challenge for Diplomats. They are
often reluctant to make and carry out tough decisions or plans lacking
in empathy, and often struggle with carrying out a plan at all. They
find greater satisfaction in abstract self-exploration and understanding
the issues that affect those least able to defend themselves than
mundane accomplishments and day-to-day tasks. Diplomats emphasize
experience and understanding rather than calculable achievement. Among
friends and family, Diplomat personalities can range from quietly caring
to brightly gregarious, so long as they can pursue the mutual exchange
of thoughts and feelings they value so highly. But they can overextend
themselves in this more personal aspect of their lives as well --
emotionally, physically, or even financially. Diplomats' open hearts
make them vulnerable when others aren't as considerate, though they
wouldn't have it any other way. Someone must trust first, and they will
almost always be the volunteer. Diplomats embrace travel as readily as
anyone -- they like exploring other cultures and people's colorful ways.
These personality types are creatively inclined, often practicing
artistic expression in diverse forms, and see magical beauty where
others

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

25

The Puzzle of Personality

see the hum-drum of daily life. For a group with such progressive
attitudes, they also appreciate seeing things as they are, a pure
expression of a way of thinking and being. Diplomats can be passionately
inspired by experiences: music, cuisine, theater, nature, and anything
else that goes beyond the obvious can rise to divine art in their eyes.
Like a gardener planting in fertile earth, Diplomats seed the world
around them with progressive change and gentle beauty. Diplomats feel
connected to forces they may not fully understand, a deep sense of faith
that may express itself, if not always through traditional religion, as
spiritual belief. Diplomats pursue things with an underlying idealism
and a sense of higher purpose; activism, spirituality, healing, the
arts, and charity are common interests for these personalities. They
have a conviction to serve a greater good, motivated by intangible
rewards felt in the heart and soul.

Sentinels Shared traits: Observant and Judging Sentinels --
Logisticians, Defenders, Executives, and Consuls -- are cooperative and
practical. Their grounded approach helps them feel comfortable with who
they are, defining themselves not by individualism, but by character and
competence. These personality types seek order, security, and stability,
and tend to work hard to maintain the way of things, leading to a
deserved reputation as the core of any group or organization, from
family to church to the office and the factory floor. These types
embrace teamwork, but expect the same performance and respectability
from others that they strive for themselves. Sentinels often dislike
strident nonconformity because they envision progress through
collaboration and hard work within a known set of rules -- to let
everyone do their own thing on a whim

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

26

The Puzzle of Personality

would be anarchy. Sentinels prefer proven methods and honest
accomplishment to self-indulgent exploration and esoteric ideas. Because
these personalities are deeply prudent, they also tend to be
self-motivated, and rarely need external inspiration to be productive.
Their grounded perspective leaves little room for random musings, but
Sentinels are not unimaginative. They experiment for anticipated gain
rather than intellectual thrills, and excel in making challenging
situations work. Revolution does not appeal to people from this Role,
who tend to learn from the past and remain loyal to the tested truths
and traditions they were brought up with. Where some see fascinating
philosophy, Sentinels may see preposterousness: these personality types
favor practiced methodology over abstract theory. Having authority
allows Sentinels to practice their virtues. Effective in leadership
roles, these types motivate others by energetic example and feel
satisfaction from guiding a well-functioning group -- they tend to make
excellent teachers, managers, and community officials, as well as
parents and hosts. These personalities are meticulous and traditional,
excelling in logistical and administrative fields with clear hierarchies
and rules as well. Opting for successful completion whenever they can,
Sentinels can be controlling, but gladly compromise when needed to get
things done. Sentinels feel rewarded by shepherding others, and enjoy
coordinating and sharing fun social experiences with friends and family.
They believe it is their responsibility to give their families safe,
happy lives that prepare them for the real world. An appreciation of
strong relationships allows them to share generously with those they
respect and love -- these types feel bolstered by having reliable people
in their lives, and will do what they can to make sure they hold up
their end of the bargain.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

27

The Puzzle of Personality

Birthdays, dinner parties, and camping trips are delightful events under
their enthusiastic direction. These personality types are happiest
without drama, though their admirably stubborn loyalty can certainly
attract it if they feel they need to stand by a friend, regardless of
whether they're in the right or wrong. Inconsistent people can test
Sentinels' tolerance and provoke harsh judgement. Sentinels tend to
prefer predictability over novelty and familiar pleasures more than
cutting-edge excitement. It can be difficult for Sentinel personalities
to accept people who lack their studious ideals, but they often respond
as engaged and caring mentors to those who wish to grow in that
direction.

Explorers Shared traits: Observant and Prospecting Explorers --
Virtuosos, Adventurers, Entrepreneurs, and Entertainers -- possess a
selfreliant mix of enthusiasm, quick thinking, and ingenuity that can
lead to impressive personal and professional accomplishments.
Comfortable with uncertainty and minimally concerned with preparation,
these personality types simply adapt and overcome as events present
themselves. Explorers' flexibility helps them make snap decisions in the
moment, and they're unlikely to dwell on the future or the past. They
aren't obsessed with precise detail (unless they're really in the zone,
in which case they can muster a level of precision and focus that would
make a seasoned engineer blush). Usually, they require workability
rather than perfection. Explorer personalities are utilitarian masters
of diverse tools and techniques, ranging from instruments and engines to
the art of persuasion, and they distinguish themselves in crises,
crafts, and sales.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

28

The Puzzle of Personality

This versatile decisiveness doesn't mean commitment, however. Explorers
can change their minds with minimal regret or second-guessing. People in
this Role dislike monotony, and often feel tempted to stray from
obligations in favor of entertaining new things. They experiment with
many interests and live and breathe whatever they connect with -- for a
time. If these personality types sometimes leave business unfinished,
let clutter build up, or misplace important things, it's because they've
moved on to something fresh. Explorers enjoy being free of obligations,
where they can indulge themselves or their interests on their own time.
An Explorer might design and build their own dream house, enthralled
with the process, but end up procrastinating on simple repairs after a
few years. They are highly motivated when steering themselves through
something interesting, but don't like being restrained by anything
"mandatory." Their relaxed, free-form attitude makes Explorer
personalities socially dynamic as well. They often seek out people and
experiences that cater to their senses, finding more pleasure in
stimulation than planning. They happily approach appealing strangers and
interesting experiences, and when things get in the way of a good time,
they apply their ingenuity to getting around it. Explorers want to see
what happens next! The same themes run through their friendships and
families, though these relationships have much more staying power than
most other interests. Rather than forcing relationships into or out of
existence though, Explorers let things flow naturally according to their
desires. Compatible people simply become a part of their lives. These
personality types tend to be individualistic and freedom-loving, going
their own way with little regard for naysayers, but they do enjoy
knowing that the people they trust will be around in the end.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

29

The Puzzle of Personality

Explorers are highly spontaneous, connecting with and adapting to their
environment in a way that is almost childlike in its wonder and sheer
fun. It can be a challenge for them to work for things with a distant or
unexciting payoff, as they need a sense of immediacy to feel truly
engaged, but when they are passionate, Explorer personalities can move
heaven and earth.

Strategies The Strategy layer reflects our preferred ways of doing
things and achieving our goals. There are four strategies: Confident
Individualism, People Mastery, Constant Improvement, and Social
Engagement. Depending on their type variant, Advocates fall under either
Confident Individualism (Assertive Advocates) or Constant Improvement
(Turbulent Advocates).

Confident Individualism Shared traits: Introverted and Assertive
Confident Individualists typically trust in themselves, and they often
embrace solitude to pursue their own interests rather than seeking out
social activity. Fascinated by personal projects, people following this
Strategy often have an impressive range of skills and interesting ideas.
But projects are usually only pursued for their own merit -- Confident
Individualists tend to feel that social displays and bragging are time
and energy wasted. These personality types are proud of who they are,
what they know, and what they can do, but they don't feel the need to
prove themselves to others. Confident Individualists engage their
internal inspiration instead of searching for motivation outside
themselves. They favor privacy, and aren't particularly fond of "The
Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

30

The Puzzle of Personality

interacting with society, whether in a strictly social sense or when
embracing broader societal goals. These personalities often favor
substance over superficiality and personal honesty over playing along,
and prefer a utilitarian approach, even when pursuing esoteric goals.
This utilitarianism also means that Confident Individualists are not
easily drawn into emotional drama. They hold their own opinions firmly,
but tend to see little reason to try to convince others. When drama does
arise, these personality types express their truth with little concern
over whether they'll cause friction or offense. Confident Individualists
tend to endorse self-reliance over cooperation, and are rarely pressured
into agreeing with or lending support to others unless they believe in
the cause. This relaxed self-assurance means that Confident
Individualists may not push their boundaries. Their live-and-let-live
attitude goes both ways: they don't need to convince others, and they
tend to expect others to return the favor. While highly capable, they
can miss information and opportunities that challenge their views
because they simply don't place much importance on factoring in others'
approval. They can be tolerant in disagreement though, respecting
others' individualism just as they respect their own. When these
personality types form friendships, they tend to be strong and honest.
Because these types don't feel like they need other people's approval,
their loyalty and affection is a deliberate expression of affection.
Impressing a Confident Individualist earns their respect and care, and
these types make for dedicated, passionate friends.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

31

The Puzzle of Personality

Self-reliance is central for these types, and they handle difficult
situations well because they tend to be emotionally secure, bold, and
resistant to stress. They rarely seek leadership or the spotlight, but
when they do find themselves in these positions, these personalities
lead by an example of self-determination and uncomplicated honesty --
they appreciate grace, class, and form, and rarely seek to impress by
appearances alone. When acting with knowledge and wisdom, Confident
Individualists can be noble pillars of strength.

People Mastery Shared traits: Extraverted and Assertive People Masters
are highly stress-resistant, maintaining confidence through life's
challenges, social pressures, and any questions of their capabilities.
These personality types seek social contact and have solid communication
skills, feeling at ease when relying on or directing other people.
People Masters' mantra is fearless engagement -- to be is to do. This is
not a group known for its timid opinions or idleness. People Masters
feel rewarded by stimulation and challenging experiences. They like
travelling to see things, people, and places, where they can experience
a richer understanding of the world around them. These personalities
like sampling new foods, lifestyles, and cultures; even things they
don't end up liking can be entertaining excitement for them. Sometimes,
though, People Masters are too confident. Insulated against self-doubt
and the need to prove themselves, they don't always test, or even
consider, their own limits or ambitions. They can slip into a pattern of
endless fun and comfort-seeking, rolling their eyes at those who press
themselves towards more intimidating goals. At

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

32

The Puzzle of Personality

the other end of the spectrum, these personality types can just as
easily ignore sensible caution, putting themselves in extraordinary and
dangerous situations, confident they can find their way through. Most
fall somewhere in the middle, embracing healthy ambition and competition
so long as they play a meaningful part in social circles and leadership.
Social interaction plays a big part in People Masters' happiness. While
not dependent on people's approval for emotional security, they
appreciate acclaim for their accomplishments and bright personalities,
and can be a touch showy from time to time. These types are
self-confident, but they are often lost without people to lead, laugh
with, and love. Their charisma, self-assurance and boisterousness can
sometimes be trying qualities. People Masters prefer cooperation, but
have few qualms about dominating their opposition to achieve their
goals, boldly promoting themselves and using their social skills to get
ahead. This Strategy understands people's needs, but can just as easily
use this as a weapon rather than a tool of compassion if they have their
sights set on something big. People Masters can compromise when needed,
but these personality types tend to be better talkers than listeners.
They can be very demanding, criticizing people's performance regardless
of their feelings because they expect no less of themselves. That said,
these types are moderate in their disagreements because their ego and
confidence aren't at stake the way they often are for Turbulent
Strategies. People Masters are not fond of grudges, content to let
bygones be bygones. They are more likely to be socially idealistic, with
the intent of bringing people together to make things happen -- petty
grievances just get in the way.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

33

The Puzzle of Personality

People Masters' charismatic virtues shine in social contexts, and these
types have little fear of rejection and a passion for inclusion. They
prefer to take the lead, but sharing the journey through other people's
eyes enhances their own enjoyment as well. People Masters share in all
aspects of people's lives, making these personalities strong, honest
friends, parents, spouses, and colleagues, serving as wellsprings of
energy, joy, and mutual success.

Constant Improvement Shared traits: Introverted and Turbulent Constant
Improvers are sensitive and contemplative individuals who enjoy having
their own space and freedom. They are often deep and creative
individuals, though often tense and more comfortable on their own than
mixed up in the judgment of the real world. With the two personality
traits most representative of a sensitivity to their environment --
Introversion and Turbulence -- they are reserved when dealing with
strangers or new situations, often turning inwards or focusing on
peacekeeping instead. These personalities' caution in the face of
unfamiliar challenges can sometimes look like a lack of motivation, but
this is usually just self-doubt -- Constant Improvers have a strong
drive, but it comes paired with a strong fear of failure. They invest a
great deal of their identity in their successes, and even a minor
misstep or embarrassment can be crushing. The vigilance learned from a
lifetime of ups and downs gives these personality types a knack for
sensing trouble. This is a strategic wariness that can be quite useful
in situations that need to balance risk and reward, whether a financial
investment or a romantic opportunity. Though they can seem frustratingly
over-cautious to others,

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

34

The Puzzle of Personality

Constant Improvers would rather not face calamity, so they excel at
avoiding it with preventive insights. Since they aren't always
comfortable with energetic exchanges with other people, Constant
Improvers often direct their attention elsewhere, striving to master
hobbies, careers, bodies of knowledge, or new means of self-expression.
Their restless drive, self-doubt, and solitary mentality can combine to
create impressive, beautiful results. High-achieving and
perfectionistic, Constant Improvers generally try to do their best in
their endeavors, dedicating tremendous time and energy. These
personalities can put so much pressure on themselves that they diminish
their own impressive accomplishments by fixating on the slightest flaws
or dismissing successes as luck rather than skill or dedication. Taken
too far, this perfectionism can also drive endless rumination -- an
unhealthy obsession with perfection will reveal flaws in the best plans,
and Constant Improvers often feel forced to abandon a course of action
because something doesn't line up right. Whether working feverishly or
picking at the threads of an idea though, Constant Improvers can be
intense about their goals, and progress towards internal balance can
lead them to amazing personal accomplishments. Alongside their personal
efforts, these personality types also care a great deal what others
think of them. This can be very useful, but they can take this to a
fault: fixating on others' expectations can sour social efforts into
awkwardness. Constant Improvers are easily thrown off-balance by
conflict, and may communicate timidly, or not at all, for fear of
hurting people's feelings, provoking a confrontation, or looking the
fool.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

35

The Puzzle of Personality

Sometimes it takes peer approval and active encouragement for this
Strategy group to recognize their own virtues. These personalities often
benefit from friends and colleagues patient enough to get to know them
and who give them a chance to speak their minds. When treated
considerately, these types become devoted partners and begin to reveal
their kindness, insights, heartfelt support, and the complexities of
their approach to the world, from sometimes (oddly specific) plans for
obscure situations to starry-eyed ambitions.

Social Engagement Shared traits: Extraverted and Turbulent Those with
the Social Engagement Strategy are an interesting group. In some ways,
Extraversion and Turbulence conflict with each other: Extraversion leads
to risktolerance and boldness; Turbulence reflects self-doubt and
sensitivity. Turbulence also contributes to impulsivity, which
Extraversion makes highly visible. This means Social Engagers tend to do
what comes naturally first and think about it later. In this way, they
are almost an exaggeration of their underlying personality types. This
isn't a bad thing. Social Engagers enthusiastically engage the external
world, not content to live in their minds, drawing emotional security
from positive interactions. In business and among loved ones, these
types are usually the center of attention. Social Engagers meet the
needs of the crowd in social settings, but they sometimes hide their
true selves to impress other people. They appreciate social status, and
often portray themselves as the person they aspire to -- usually a purer
form of their personality type -- in order to achieve it.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

36

The Puzzle of Personality

Social Engagers often experience stunning highs and lows as their
Extraversion pushes their Turbulent need for success into overdrive and
their Turbulence creates an immediate sense of regret, warranted or not.
These personality types can be surprisingly competitive, measuring
themselves against peers and hoping others notice their accomplishments,
then retreat, suddenly becoming averse to conflict, leading them to
apologize for or avoid confrontations -- even those that ended in
beneficial discussions. These personalities may falter occasionally in
their self-confidence, but ultimately they are driven to improve and
achieve. At the end of the day, they have no trouble blowing off some
steam and enjoying a much-needed break, either. Social Engagers
enthusiastically pursue stimulating and exciting experiences, especially
with a group of friends. They much prefer to dive into an experience
than to sit down for a reserved evaluation, though many will naturally
regret their hot-headed lack of planning down the road. This push and
pull between ambition and alarm, impulse and caution, highs and lows can
itself be quite stressful, but it's all part of this Strategy's charm.
These personality types are often restless in pursuit of their goals to
improve their circumstances, but show their passion by indulging their
desires through some earned fun (and maybe shopping for something
impressive). Social Engagers work hard at their personal and
professional development, striving to meet all manner of stringent
standards, but they lead dynamic lives as well, filled with
companionship, sharing adventures and accomplishments with others
whenever possible. Whatever direction they pull, they are sure to pull
the crowd with them. While the Strategies are important, this series of
e-books simply doesn't have the space to explore them properly. For now,
we'll focus on the inner core: The four Roles.

Who Is "The Advocate"?

Idealistic, loving, and a positive force for good in the world,
Advocates are so much more than meets the eye. Throughout this book, we
discuss how Advocates' traits manifest themselves into a complete
personality type, and we look at how interactions among the traits
result in a unique set of behaviors that affect their personal growth,
varied relationships, and academic and professional development. The
following paragraphs are a brief overview of the personality type, and
each subtopic is explored in much greater detail in subsequent chapters.
Personal Growth Advocates are the rarest personality type, making up
about one percent of the population (depending on geographic region).
But their rarity shouldn't be mistaken for invisibility. Although their
Introverted trait may make them seem calm, reserved, or shy, Advocates
are resolute in their beliefs. With passion and focus, these inspired
individuals tend to leave their marks on the world. Although they have a
strong sense of idealism and morality, what sets Advocates apart is the
accompanying Judging trait. These personalities aren't just idle
dreamers;

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

39

The Puzzle of Personality

they are highly capable of planning steps to meet their goals and make a
positive impact. They may be cautious, but their inner flame and passion
shouldn't be taken lightly. They maintain strong, sometimes
single-minded convictions, but they also strive for peaceful harmony.
Genuinely affectionate and caring, they express these qualities with a
noble sincerity. Advocates are often quiet, but theirs is the thoughtful
silence of an internal debate that must come to a consensus before
action is taken. Once caution has been exercised, however, Advocates are
decisive, likely to render their judgment on a subject with firm
finality (though they are always sensitive to an impassioned appeal).
Prudent in their decisions and optimistic in their dealings, Advocates
may find themselves at the forefront of any movement they take part in,
even if they would otherwise shrink from the spotlight. If people with
this personality type have a common stumbling block in life, it's
wrestling with the differences between their grand dreams and reality.
While absorbed in their closely held hopes and beliefs, Advocates may
not pay much attention to external limits, insisting instead on
surpassing their own high expectations. This drive may help them break
down the toughest barriers, but it can also easily lead to
disappointment when the rest of the world doesn't seem to care as deeply
as they do, or even agree with them. Conflict and criticism can be
frustrating for Advocates, whose own principled regard for others isn't
always met with equal consideration. They very much value respect and
harmony, and their optimism about people means they aren't always
equipped to deal with those who are insincere, harsh, or opportunistic.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

40

The Puzzle of Personality

Friends, Family, and Relationships Human connections are of paramount
importance to Advocates. They work diligently to ensure their personal
ties remain strong -- not through coercion or cynical appeals, but
through the slow, steady work of bringing hearts and minds together.
Although not boldly social, they love meeting like-minded people, and
they are extraordinarily kind, generous, and dedicated to their friends.
Their devotion may be intense, though, and even though Advocates are
rarely domineering in their assertions, other types may find it daunting
to be in the company of such unswerving drive. Their lofty convictions
may be challenging for some, but those who share Advocates' principles
find that the commonality leads to long friendships and dedicated
partnerships, romantic or otherwise. As much as Advocates draw strength
from their inner circle, rarely are they satisfied to let their sphere
of influence end there. However, tolerance isn't an easy virtue: these
types sometimes have difficulty reconciling the messy pragmatism of
otherwise good people with their own rigid moral code. Learning to
compromise, without becoming compromised themselves, is a balancing act
for Advocates, torn as they are between their compassion for others and
their need to remain faithful to their ideals. The idealism these types
hold dear is reflected in their family life as well. Advocates place
their highest hopes for the future of humanity in their children, and
they tend to make extremely doting, conscientious parents. When it comes
to their extended family of cherished relatives and closest friends,
they're both responsible and caring, and they gently hold all their
loved ones to the same high standards they themselves strive for.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

The Puzzle of Personality

Academic and Professional Development Advocates are typically fulfilled
by work that improves the lives of others and keeps them connected to
people. It should be no surprise, then, that many dedicate themselves to
one of the helping professions, whether their requisite paths are going
to college, attending grad school, or simply rolling up their sleeves
and getting to work. If circumstances delay their dreams of meaningful
work, their strong interpersonal skills allow them to flourish in
alternate positions until their dreams can be realized. Advocates bring
heart to any endeavor, then shape it to fit their values. Advocates are
diligent in any work they do, but they find strict hierarchies and
aimless "busy work" unappealing. Whether in the classroom or on the job,
those who aren't regularly presented with meaningful challenges and the
freedom to explore them tend to eventually search for environments where
they will be. Their dreams of expanding their own minds can't be held
back by convention, no matter how dull their surroundings. With their
thirst for progress and vivid imaginations, they can't help but turn
things over in their minds, taking them far into the future, even to
extreme possibilities. Once they feel comfortable that people are
interested in what they have to say, they are likely to overcome any
shyness or reservations and gladly contribute their thoughtful
introspection and creativity. Advocates may become extremely valued in
classes or professional teams, appreciated for their fantastic blend of
compassion, imagination, and dedication. Although high-minded principles
and emotional connections are important to Advocates, so are their own
achievements, and their self-drive wonderfully elevates their
environments and the people around them.

Advocates' Personal Growth

Looking Inward, Searching Outside Advocates, more than most, invest
themselves in the unlimited potential of personal growth, and they focus
on developing the internal, seeking deep self-improvement in a way that
borders on a spiritual quest. Some Advocates may even proclaim their
self-development a spiritual act. This type knows much of who they are
and what they do is fueled by the pursuit of their own inner freedom,
peace, and strength. And what they develop within, they express
outwardly. When Advocates sense conflict, either with themselves or the
world, they're not content to put up with it. They feel compelled to
find and carry out solutions that create harmony, and to make headway
toward creating a better world. Advocates grow by nurturing their
integrity and defining their genuine selves, and they do not journey
through life casually. They ultimately seek order in the universe and
see themselves as promoters of that order. They may or may not be
religious, but regardless of their beliefs, Advocates' growth is likely
to be intense in its depth. A code of ethics is typically present in
these types' lives, whether transmitted through

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

Advocates' Personal Growth

a mentor or a belief system, or cobbled together by the experiences they
have had, and it plays a large role in how they assess themselves. The
idealism so integral to Advocate thinking can also burden them with
self-doubt. After all, it's difficult to live up to such standards, so
when they compare their reality to their ideal, they may find the
difference intimidating. By allowing themselves to forgive any human
flaws they may discover within, Advocates can help avoid a paralysis of
doubt that can prevent their growth. These types live internally: They
may need to build confidence, both to grow and to express that growth in
more outward and more broadly influential ways. Finding a Cause To grasp
fulfilment, Advocates need a reason or purpose, and much of how they
measure their lives hinges on being true to that purpose. They usually
express this raison d'etre through causes, whether organized and formal
or personal and individual. For Advocates, causes are outward
manifestations of their beliefs, and alignment between the two is
fundamental to their perception of themselves. This alignment also
informs and measures their personal development strategies and the
degree to which they consider their actions and attitudes responsible.
Almost everything in this section hinges on Advocates' purposes and
causes because they are essential to growth for this type. The greatest
goal for Advocates involves coming to terms with their true selves.
Regardless of what cause Advocates champion, their involvement reflects
certain values, and those values are far more important than an isolated
concern or situation. Whereas most would deem an isolated war against a
tyrannical force necessary, Advocates who happen to be pacifists may
cope poorly with the idea of a

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

45

Advocates' Personal Growth

battle, even if beating a foe means saving lives. Their causes and
principles can supplant the most realistic actions at times. This can
prove to be a powerful burden to idealistic Advocates who wish to make
an impact on the real world. Advocates who wish to grow must avoid
allowing their ideals to become dogma, or their dedication to causes to
harden into inflexibility. This caring type can become so firmly
insistent that they struggle to remember that they were originally
motivated by compassion. When passion burns, humility and selflessness
can be consumed in the fire: Advocates who wish to grow in a way that
serves the world must always keep an eye on where their passion takes
them. They must know when to temper their zeal. Fortunately, their need
to be genuine and true to themselves usually catches up to them, at
which point they realize that pushy fanaticism is not part of their
values; their values typically invite others to grow on their own terms.

Components of Personal Growth In the sections that follow, we talk about
what motivates Advocates to grow, strategies they might follow, and
perspectives they need to aid the process. Advocates find motivation
from five closely related but distinct components of their
personalities: •

Self-esteem speaks to Advocates' sense of worth. It is measured by the
degree of value they feel they offer to their world or community.

•

Self-respect speaks to how much they like themselves. If they were
sitting across the table from themselves having coffee, would they like
them based on what they've done with their lives? Would they want a
second meeting?

•

Self-confidence is the energy source that moves Advocates forward in
life. When they feel that their actions reflect their genuine natures
and are true to "The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

46

Advocates' Personal Growth

their understanding of the world, that sense of honesty fuels their
enthusiasm and their certainty. Tying their actions to that which they
see as authentic helps them burst forth with positive energy. •

Self-evolution is the path Advocates take to develop themselves and to
grow. In an almost circular way, their growth comes from exploring
growth both for themselves and others. From an Advocate's perspective,
everyone is teeming with potential, and growth comes from tapping into,
expanding, and nurturing that potential.

•

Self-responsibility is Advocates' ability to take credit and
responsibility for their decisions and the results of those decisions.
When they have a balanced sense of self-responsibility, they can
accurately separate what outcomes they are responsible for and what
falls on the shoulders of others. In other words, they have a more
accurate idea of which things they control and which they don't.

The first three of the five components above -- self-esteem,
self-respect, and selfconfidence -- involve more inward self-assessment
and awareness. The latter two, self-evolution and self-responsibility,
involve outward expressions, with an eye toward strategy and Advocates'
more active response to their worlds. A proper balance of all five
aspects is both the cause and the result of a successful and fulfilling
life. But any one of the aspects going off-kilter can create
difficulties. In the following sections, we first examine components of
Advocates' personal growth in their balanced and more developed form.
Then we describe the tendencies that emerge if these components become
unbalanced: We explore how abandoning healthy and productive
motivational strategies, which can happen when Advocates become
disconnected from their true selves, can lead to adverse effects.
Finally, we

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

47

Advocates' Personal Growth

discuss what Advocates can do to improve balance, especially when they
lose perspective and need to restore an even approach. Explanation,
tips, and concrete actions are provided to aid personal growth and
development.

Self-Esteem Self-esteem is an individual's sense of self-worth.
Advocates derive their feelings of worth from their compassion and the
many ways it can be expressed.

Balanced Self-Esteem A Sense of Purpose Advocates need to know they have
connected with other people -- but not in a simple social sense; it must
be deeper, perhaps even spiritual. This type needs to exercise empathy
and creativity to feel as though they have a purpose. Leading with their
vision, feelings, and insight, they derive personal pride by starting or
joining causes and activities that focus on idealistic concerns. Their
causes do not have to be the type read about in newspapers -- local,
family, office, or community causes will do just as well as national or
international movements. Such causes offer a perfect opportunity for
Advocates to build self-esteem by sharing their virtues with others.
Advocates who keep their altruism grounded realize their identity and
worth through the good they do. It's a cliché to say that good work is
its own reward, but for Advocates, such a statement is likely not mere
modesty, but the truth of what good works mean to their existence.

Harmony Is Order Advocates view harmony and order as interrelated
qualities. Others may regard order as following the rules or ticking off
the right procedures, but Advocates view it as people relating well or
effectively with one another. Order and harmony, as filtered through the
minds of Advocates, mean that those involved receive respect, fairness,
and equal treatment. When they play a part in making that happen, they
believe they have contributed something of value, and this confirms
their own worth. This doesn't mean Advocates avoid conflicts. On the
contrary, sometimes seeking justice requires a stern stance. But even
when they don't agree with others, their broader goals remain --
creating equity and bringing accord to their environments. For
Advocates, order and harmony are not simply about everyone feeling good.
They are about a vision of what is right and wrong, and how applying
that vision benefits everyone. Therefore, anger and disputes may well
play a small role in the larger harmony that Advocates seek. Aristotle
said, "Anyone can get angry, but to do this to the right person, to the
right extent, at the right time, with the right motive, and in the right
way, that is not for everyone, nor is it easy."

Unbalanced Self-Esteem Stretched Too Thin Advocates may overcompensate
for low self-esteem by caring too much about the needs of others at the
expense of their own. Advocates who feel driven to strengthen their
sense of worth may find themselves committed to dealing with too many
other people's problems, of which there is an endless supply.
Self-neglect may be an early warning sign of Advocates with self-esteem
that needs attention.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

49

Advocates' Personal Growth

As unbalanced Advocates work themselves into overdrive to help others,
losing sight of their own needs, burnout threatens to become a
significant danger. This is especially true when they take on the
problems of the people they love most -- their family members and
friends. In addition, unscrupulous people may try to take advantage of
this type when they are in a weakened, excessively kind state. Caring
for others tempered by common sense and self-nurturing is caring that
endures and is sustainable. Paradoxically, Advocates who allow the
anguish of others to overwhelm them as they try to bolster their own
self-esteem soon find they have no emotional or physical resources left.
With burnout, no energy remains for the things they do to lift their
sense of self-worth. Advocates must take caution to prudently measure
their limits and feed their own needs while simultaneously helping
others. Driven to Conflict If creating harmony increases self-esteem,
disrupting harmony can start a downward spiral of self-loathing. When
Advocates take on too much, or begin to feel resentful when they believe
that others are taking advantage of them, they engage in behaviors that
are counter to their nature. Mental and emotional exhaustion can drive
them to reject demands for attention from others. Such behavior is a
stark contrast to Advocates' typical generosity, and it serves to
further damage their sense of their own value. When Advocates' personal
values aren't reflected or appreciated by those surrounding them, they
can suffer from a sense of isolation, even if it's a product of their
own imaginations rather than reality. In reaction, they may judge things
harshly and may experience resentment -- often toward themselves. When
Advocates sense

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

50

Advocates' Personal Growth

that others aren't hearing their voices or respecting them, they may see
it as an injustice. They can feel rejected, powerless, or angry, leading
to combative behavior. These dark feelings are far from the
compassionate emotions they pride themselves on.

Rebalancing Self-Esteem Making Time for Self When it occurs to Advocates
that they've stretched themselves too thin, their only choice is to
reclaim their energy by attending to their own essential needs. This
doesn't mean they must abandon their altruism, but they can schedule
their time and energy to include more robust personal care. When
Advocates sense their own value, they naturally find themselves to be
worthy of self-care. The act of pursuing restorative rest and recreation
is an expression of positive self-esteem. As a bonus, when properly
valuing themselves, Advocates create even more energy necessary to care
for others -- creating a positive cycle that ultimately boosts
self-worth. Advocates strive to secure equality for all people. It is
reasonable, in the name of equality, to assume that they are no less
worthy than those they care for; thus, they deserve care themselves.
Just as they would encourage others to rest and find joy in their lives,
they benefit from encouraging themselves. A calendar to keep track of
the time they dedicate to their own needs is a simple but powerful tool.
•

Make a list of the times you indulged your personal needs in the past
seven days. The list can include activities like exercising, eating
right, getting enough sleep, pursuing recreational interests, spending
time with family and friends,

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

51

Advocates' Personal Growth

meditating, getting a massage, and so on. Was it enough? A concrete
inventory of your current state of self-care can help you decide your
next steps toward restoration. •

Treat self-care, however you define it, as you would any other goal.
Writing an appointment on a calendar, and not relying simply on memory
and good intentions, can make the goal real. To succeed, treat your
appointments with yourself just as you would work or family obligations.

•

Be sure you are fully recharged before giving time and energy to others.
Learning to say "no," at times, to optional requests can be a vital part
of selfcare. You have the right, perhaps even the duty, to replenish
your vitality and enthusiasm.

"Carve out and claim the time to care for yourself and kindle your own
fire," writes yoga teacher Amy Ippoliti. Advocates kindling their own
fires not only care for themselves, but also allow others to benefit
from their warmth. Finding Serenity in Self Advocates want to maintain a
compassionate, loving frame of mind. When their behaviors don't match
this intent, they may want to examine their sense of selfworth. If they
engage in regular conflicts with others, they can examine their
contentious feelings to find out whether they come from principles
they've established in their lives or something more subjective in the
moment. Advocates don't mind fighting for a cause, and being scrappy
while taking a stand may even be an expression of high self-esteem, but
if conflict comes from an injured ego, a feeling that they aren't
receiving enough respect, or a loss of purpose, some introspective
measures may be necessary.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

52

Advocates' Personal Growth

Restoring attitudes and feelings so they are more aligned with
Advocates' natural tendencies begins by renewing a sense of purpose and
effectiveness. Part of this involves challenging any faulty notions that
may contribute to low-esteem. •

Make a list of inaccurate self-talk, listing things you tell yourself
that just aren't true. Everybody does it, so nobody should end up with
an empty list. For example: o "If I don't live up to my ideals
perfectly, I have no right to advocate for them." o "If I don't get the
proper amount of validation from others, it indicates that I am not
worthy of respect." o "How can I take care of myself when others need my
time and energy?" o "It's not perfect, so it's useless to try."

•

Once the list is made, answer the negative ideas. In your responses,
create new self-talk. o "I don't have to perfectly represent an ideal to
profess it or advocate for it. Every messenger is an imperfect
messenger." o "The validation of others is subjective. Their opinions
alone say nothing about my worth." o "I have to take care of myself if I
want to help others. And I am worth the effort." o "Perfectionism is a
trap that leads to paralysis. It's better to attempt something
imperfectly than it is to do nothing for fear my efforts won't be
perfect."

•

One you have cleared out the clutter of damaging self-talk, further
restore your sense of purpose by engaging in meaningful work. o Call a
friend or relative with whom you have lost contact.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

53

o Volunteer at a food bank or other community resource for a day. o Take
it upon yourself to pick up trash at a community park. o Offer to
babysit for a harried new mother in the neighborhood or cut the lawn of
some elderly people in the area. Contributing to a harmony in their
communities while remaining in charge of their own schedules and
intentions is an outstanding way for Advocates to regain their sense of
worth.

Self-Respect Advocates who own solid self-respect are simply people who
like themselves. When self-respect is strong, they enjoy looking in
their mental mirrors because they like the reflection that comes from
their self-assessments.

Balanced Self-Respect Standing Tall Advocates respect themselves most
when they stand against injustice and cruelty. They must view themselves
as a caring force on the planet. For some, self-respect can come from
living a life that is a chain of good deeds, but Advocates need a larger
sense of their contributions. Whether consciously or subconsciously,
this usually translates into some form of a mission. The size of the
mission is not important, but the mission must answer some higher
principle. The work may involve something as simple as dealing with a
single child's self-esteem or as large-scale and complex as world
hunger. Whether it's personal or

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

54

Advocates' Personal Growth

global, Advocates respect themselves when their actions align with their
greater virtues.

Unbalanced Self-Respect Frustration with Flaws Advocates are prone to
relentless perfectionism -- unless they remain aware of that tendency
and counter it. If they surrender to the siren call of "perfect," they
may become critical of themselves and others. When their exacting
tendencies take over and create unrealistically high expectations,
stressful frustration and disappointment can build emotional pressure.
Advocates can be idealistic and too demanding on not only themselves,
but also the people who are important in their lives. Although they can
be visionaries and inspiring leaders, their sense of justice and their
principles don't always survive contact with reality. It's crucial for
Advocates to recognize that the world isn't ideal. However, their
self-respect hinges on their ability to "make a difference," so they may
struggle with feeling inadequate when they fail to live up their own
expectations. In response to disappointment and frustration over the
flaws they see in themselves and in their world, they may flee on some
level and isolate themselves. This goes beyond their usually healthy
wish to be alone for introspection or to recharge. For unbalanced
Advocates, interactions with the world may become a painful mirror,
reflecting actions they have adapted to an imperfect world but which are
not a match for their ideals. They may cope by hiding out, but doing so
is not aligned with their ideals either. Self-respect suffers further
when they tuck themselves away.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

55

Advocates' Personal Growth

Knowing What's Best for Others Should they lose a sense of self-respect,
Advocates may try to boost the characteristics they like about
themselves, sometimes slipping into thinking that they know what is best
for other people. They may stop waiting for others to come to them in
their hour of need, instead insisting on helping -- whether others want
it or not. This may be a product of trusting their sophisticated and
intuitive empathy too much. Those who hope to like themselves better may
begin to believe they have the best possible answers to their friends',
families', and co-workers' problems. When help becomes too pushy, it may
be more annoying than helpful. There is no doubt that Advocates who
extend their hands to others do so out of compassion and altruism.
However, that doesn't mean they don't find it fulfilling themselves.
There is likely some selfishness behind every "selfless" act -- whether
the promise of heaven or better self-appreciation. There's nothing wrong
with that; it's rewarding to be a better person, and everybody wins when
someone practices kindness. But when the overshadowing motivation is
self-bolstering due to a loss of self-respect, Advocates' help may start
to ring hollow.

Rebalancing Self-Respect Celebrating Failure Advocates have high
expectations for society and themselves. Focusing on the tasks and
causes they haven't managed to carry out and needs they have yet to meet
-- both on a personal and a global scale -- can be incredibly
demoralizing. Sweeping perfectionism can be a challenging obstacle to a
happy life. Advocates can restore self-respect by reframing their
expectations. Rather than putting all their blemishes beneath a
microscope, they can instead focus on failure as a gift.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

56

Advocates' Personal Growth

The key is to focus on failure as a lesson rather than a suggestion that
they are missing some inherent ability or have taken a wrong path. When
something doesn't go right, Advocates can rebalance their thinking by
telling themselves, "This hasn't succeeded ... yet." Achieving a
standard of perfection is impossible. Advocates can restore their
selfrespect when they realize this and absolve themselves of any
unreasonable guilt. These types don't have to act in perfect alignment
with their ideals 100 percent of the time; it's unlikely anyone can.
They can become more comfortable with their flaws by understanding that
if they are doing all they can, then they are moving forward. To begin
rebalancing their thinking, Advocates can: •

List five things that have gone right in the past 24 hours. Avoid deep
pondering, and simply name the first things that come to mind.

•

Pick a recent "failure." Have an imaginary conversation with it. What
was the failure trying to teach you? If you could give the fiasco a
human personality, what would it tell you?

•

Take the sting out of failing. Never danced before? Take a dance class
and expect to be terrible at first. Can't draw a straight line? Take a
pad and pencil and go somewhere interesting like the woods or city
street. Draw what you see. Practice doing things that won't be perfect.
Discover that failure is survivable and, in fact, essential to growing.

Learning from mistakes then moving forward without shame is always an
option, and taking this approach will help Advocates rebalance their
self-respect.

57

Advocates' Personal Growth

Reclaiming Intent Once Advocates deal with their perfectionism, they may
wish to reassess their intentions and motivations. Those trying to
restore their self-respect may wrestle with what they discover. Their
essential tactics for growth rarely involve telling people who they
should be. Instead, they usually offer support to help others discover
their own paths. Altruism involves being selfless and prioritizing the
needs of others. Only when they have veered off-course will Advocates
disguise their own needs as altruism. Exploring their motives may help
them separate their own interests from the interests of those they claim
to be helping. Rather than forcing what they believe is best for others,
Advocates will like themselves better in the long run if they remember
that their basic, natural mission is promoting growth as it uniquely
applies to individuals. The following exercises will help clarify
motivations and increase focus on the needs and wants of others. •

Take a piece of paper or open journal and write the answers to the
following questions: o "What is my purpose, and how do I fulfill it in
daily life?" (There may be many purposes. Choose one.) o To ensure
specificity, in fewer than five words, answer, "Why do I do it?"

•

For the next week, make it a point to ask at least two people a day, "Is
there anything I can do for you?" Keep it general and free of any hints
of direction. Listen very carefully to hear what they want, and respond
to that, rather than to any presumptions of what they need.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

58

Advocates' Personal Growth

There is nothing wrong with feeling good about helping others. However,
if that becomes the primary focus, it's easy to lose sight of what is
actually helpful. Advocates should learn to separate what is best for
others from what they presume is best for others.

Self-Confidence Advocates' confidence comes from feeling connected to
their true selves. They dislike anything they regard as phony, and they
always strive to be as real as they can. When they are aligned with what
they feel is genuine about themselves, they advance with assuredness.

Balanced Self-Confidence Sharing the Honest Self Only when Advocates act
according to the truths they know can they move forward with any sense
of certainty. Others may trust their physical skills or their
rationality to fuel confidence. For Advocates, it's believing they know
the right thing to do, and although skills and logic may come into play,
they hold secondary roles. Advocates' energy usually comes from
certitude of the moral variety. When they know they have aligned
themselves with their values and have a sense of being true to what is
important to them, their response to life is a confident one. From moral
certitude and a pervasive sense of authenticity emerges passion. There
is an intense nature to Advocates' enthusiasm, born of deep convictions.
When their self-confidence is strong, their actions are less like
completing some task or job and more like fulfilling a calling or
mission. When something is aligned with Advocates' beliefs, they do not
take it lightly, which makes them serious-minded individuals. "The
Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

Trusting Their Principles Advocates form an opinion of right or wrong
and use that opinion as a measurement to size up behavior -- theirs and
others. To do any less feels false to Advocates. Integrity, as they
understand it, serves as their guiding force. When they sense their own
integrity, they move forward confidently. In cyclic fashion, when they
act according to their integrity, they gain confidence, and then their
confidence encourages them to continue to act with integrity. With
Advocates' taste for emotional decision-making, others are likely to
benefit from their principles, and they typically stand with the
underdog and strive to promote fairness. This leads them to their
cause-oriented interests, and the truer they are to those interests, the
more likely they are to trust themselves. This commitment to integrity
provides a path for Advocates. As they cling to their standards, their
code keeps them organized, and when they are at their best, their
standards provide a certain sense of stability. There is no doubt what
Advocates stand for in a broad sense. When Advocates align themselves
with their values, they not only create a sense of self-confidence for
themselves, but they also offer a kind of reliability to those around
them, extending their sense of confidence beyond themselves. It may be
as simple as others knowing they will always get an honest response from
Advocates or as profound as knowing that Advocates will always extend a
helping hand in times of trouble.

Unbalanced Self-Confidence Honestly Inflexible Advocates who lose faith
in their connection to their true self and suffer a crisis of confidence
may overcompensate by pushing their past agendas, perhaps even

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

60

Advocates' Personal Growth

outdated ones, too hard. In similar fashion, if they feel they can't
connect enough with their true self to produce a sense of certainty,
they may try to artificially conjure up a facsimile -- mimicking
boldness and becoming brash. Of course, this is not who they are, so
they short-circuit their real confidence, which is fueled by
genuineness. Insecure people are often the loudest voices in the room,
and that may apply to Advocates who lose their way. They may become so
intent in restoring their confidence that they abandon their
characteristic open-mindedness and ignore the wishes and interests of
others. Focusing on their own interests, they may become self-absorbed
and intolerant of ideas not their own. They may appear far from the
thoughtful Introverted types they are at their core. Confused by
Criticism Advocates identify so closely with their ideals that, when
they are criticized, it may be hard for them to separate the evaluation
of their performance from a judgment of their principles. Because they
find their self-confidence by aligning themselves with their core
beliefs, feedback may feel like an attack on what they hold to be true
rather than a single act they made. Their serious nature may place more
weight on a critique than it may deserve. The waters may become muddied
between who the Advocates are, what they believe, and what they do. A
critic might address only one of those, but Advocates may not be able to
separate the three. When Advocates feel attacked or sense that a critic
wants to undermine their selfconfidence, they may raise a wall around
themselves. Defensive people either withdraw or fortify their positions,
rather than consider the value of criticism. Neither is particularly
helpful to Advocates' growth -- or anyone else for that matter.

61

Advocates' Personal Growth

Rebalancing Self-Confidence Restoring Open-Minded Confidence Confidence
is an attitude that allows one to act with a measure of assurance. It
comes from within, but people fortify and confirm it by their outward
expressions and their successes. This forms a feedback loop, but the
cycle usually starts internally for Advocates. They may want to make
sure that they don't try to reverse matters by over-controlling their
outer worlds to create a false sense of self-assurance. In fact, such an
attempt may be the opposite of real confidence as Advocates experience
it. Learning to trust their principles and stick with them -- despite
the flow of the rest of the world -- may be an essential step in
restoring confidence. Acting as if they are confident can be a strategy
for some people, but it doesn't work for Advocates, who rely on their
authenticity. One way to do restore self-confidence involves consciously
connecting purpose and principles to actions. Advocates can recruit a
trusted friend, relative, mentor, or spiritual adviser to go on this
journey with them (their inclination toward rigorous idealism may make
them too self-critical to catalog how their actions match their
principles). The following steps can help Advocates discover more about
the alignment that creates their confidence: •

Assign a subjective number to your confidence level: 1 being no
confidence and 10 being leonine boldness.

•

Re-list your ideals, purposes, and intentions in life. Be as
comprehensive as you can.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

62

Advocates' Personal Growth

•

Next, perhaps with your adviser, connect the things you do in your life
with those ideals. Nothing is too small. Encouraging the supermarket
clerk who is bagging your groceries with a "good job" is not too
insignificant, and larger expressions matter as well.

•

Go somewhere safe (your work or school, for example), and look for ways
to help other individuals. Maybe help them carry boxes or books. Perhaps
you can get someone coffee. Find a real-time, practical way to show and
share your values.

•

How would you rate your actions' alignment with your values and purpose?
Where are you doing well? Where might you improve? Does this assessment
reflect your level of self-confidence?

Advocates develop and preserve self-confidence by approaching life with
a genuine integrity that reflects their values and purpose. Taking an
occasional inventory of how their actions match with those will help
them nurture their sense of confidence. Handling Criticism Advocates who
react too severely to criticism may be experiencing a fear of rejection.
This fear is present in nearly all of us, but especially in Advocates,
who see themselves as representations of ideas as much as they are
people. They want to tell the world that they're steady, capable, and
compassionate. They embrace these idealized personas, and whenever
something arises that knocks down that image, they might panic.
Advocates should remember that criticism of themselves or their ideals
is not always personal, nor is it something universal about them.
Another person's critique may have nothing to do with Advocates' overall
identity or values. It might be isolated to

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

63

Advocates' Personal Growth

a specific action, or it could even be the result of the critic having a
bad day. Advocates who look at critiques objectively and take the time
to sort out different layers may discover that a criticism was no
significant threat at all. With objectivity, they may find that they
truly disagree with the criticism and reject it, or they may discover
that there is something to be learned from it. Either way, that which
gives them stability and confidence remains out of danger. The following
strategy can help Advocates work through any criticism they receive with
a measure of objectivity: •

Can I learn something about myself from the criticism, or even from my
reaction to the criticism? Am I unsure of myself to the point where I
can't weather a little criticism from others? If so, how can I restore
my sense of being true to myself.

•

Next time criticism arises, consider any and all of the following: o
Avoid the temptation to defend yourself until you've heard the criticism
completely -- and perhaps avoid the temptation even then. o Paraphrase
the criticism for the person providing the feedback so that it's clear
that each person is talking about the exact same thing. o Ask what the
critic would do differently, or request suggestions from them. o In a
lateral relationship, suggest taking a little time to consider the
information. o In an unequal relationship, with a superior being the
critic, try to learn from the criticism.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

64

Advocates' Personal Growth

o All things being equal, attempt to do things differently in compliance
with the criticism, even if it's just an experiment. The results may be
pleasantly surprising. o Later, take time to decide whether the
criticism has merit or not. Accepting criticism without measuring it
against their core values and what makes sense to them is not going to
work for Advocates. Being true to themselves is the only way for them to
move confidently forward. Honest evaluation is a necessary step for this
type. Anchoring their actions in their beliefs is the primary way
Advocates develop selfconfidence. However, as with anything, there are
potential traps, in this case overcompensating with rigidity or
defensiveness. Fortunately, as with any trap, there is always a means of
escape and various ways to recover. In the end, self-assured Advocates
tap into their inner convictions and create positive momentum by
aligning their achievements with them.

Self-Evolution Self-evolution is a lifelong trek along a path of
positive change. Although the journey can happen naturally, a more
active role in personal development is sometimes necessary to discover
one's identity and purpose.

Balanced Self-Evolution Growth as the Purpose of Living Advocates always
seek to grow and learn -- and, inevitably, when they are true to their
best natures, they face and accept their own limits. They personify the
adage, "There

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

65

Advocates' Personal Growth

is no staying the same. You're either getting better or you're getting
worse." Indeed, Advocates define themselves by their journeys in very
intimate ways, and their instinct is to strive for improvement and to
realize their best selves. Advocates' favored path of self-development
is likely to be individual. Even if they are part of a self-help group,
their learning may be communal, but their implementation is likely to be
on their own. They would rather provide support for other people's
growth than receive support from others -- they usually are too
independent to let others help them in this personal way and will likely
resist any attempts at such support. Being true to themselves means
being strict about keeping their own counsel first. Nonetheless, to grow
and to become actualized, Advocates must interact with people. They are
most likely to succeed when they find a workable balance between
autonomous introspection and social connection. Advocates often
compartmentalize their development in two ways. One compartment may
include lone practices such as meditating, reading, taking long nature
walks, listening to motivational or spiritual teachers, or just sitting
around and pondering the nature of the universe. The other includes
communal efforts such as employment, deep relationships, and social
causes. Each contributes in some way to Advocates' growth, but they
remain decidedly separate in their lives. Think of Ancient sages who
traditionally retired to the wilderness to discover their calling or to
restore their souls only to return to society in a renewed state.
Delving Deeply Self-evolution goes beyond mere self-improvement and the
contents of the self-help shelves in the bookstore. Although Advocates
might enjoy thinking about succeeding at business or becoming more
popular, they only flirt with such surface

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

66

Advocates' Personal Growth

considerations. They don't see their development as a technical
step-by-step plan that goes from point A to point B. Instead, their
central focus is on a dynamic and organic blossoming of self-discovery.
Their evolution involves organizing their lives in ways that nurture
their own psychological health, their social consciousness, or that of
others. In an almost circular fashion, they develop by developing and
helping others develop. Advocates may not have all the answers, but they
have some idea where life is taking them, and they generally have a
vision of what they want their lives to be. There is nothing "quick-fix"
about their personal development, but they are fine with that because
they prefer a life filled with ongoing vitality and enrichment.
Advocates see their self-evolution as a lifelong chain of insights.

Unbalanced Self-Evolution The Drain of Constant Growth Although genuine
growth is a good thing, an excessive focus on growth can lead to
pitfalls. Advocates, who define themselves by their development and
evolution, are prone to such tunnel vision. If they interpret growth as
an unrelenting passion that requires uninterrupted progress, it can be
exhausting. This can happen when they find themselves unhappy with their
rate of growth, however they measure it. Satisfaction involves
appreciating things as they are. It is an immediate quality, not found
in imagining a better future. Although dissatisfaction can be
motivating, Advocates should balance it with a recognition of
fulfillment along the way. Otherwise, happiness may always feel just out
of reach. Small steps forward are steps forward, and they should be
celebrated.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

67

Advocates' Personal Growth

Restorative periods are essential to growth, and everyone needs times
when, at least temporarily, they drop the effort and allow life to occur
in its own way, free of ambitious impulses. Creative thoughts often
occur in moments of idle work, like while doing the dishes or raking the
yard. Advocates who feel driven to chase their better selves all the
time risk missing fresh perspectives and creative solutions. Personal
Obsession Similarly, Advocates should make sure their big ideas and deep
thoughts don't distract them from the mundane yet important details of
their lives. Advocates who feel they're lagging in development may
decide to concentrate on their "evolution," to the detriment of whatever
they think won't help their growth. The more pedestrian and perhaps
easier considerations in life can become unmanageable when Advocates set
them aside altogether. Advocates' grand plans may falter when they fail
to consider the smaller facets of a venture, instead focusing only on
the expansive "big-picture" view. Even great and noble projects can fail
when someone forgets to check the legal details, handle administrative
tasks, or estimate the workload. Although Advocates generally prefer
predictability and order, an exciting vision can overshadow their need
for organization: An Advocate trying to defeat poverty can overlook
their own finances and go bankrupt, contributing to the very problem
they tried doggedly to solve.

Rebalancing Self-Evolution Focusing on Today Advocates can rebalance by
attending to self-care. However, simply spending a few days at the beach
isn't likely to restore balance if Advocates spend the entire time

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

68

Advocates' Personal Growth

considering ways to become a better person once they get home. If they
aren't being mindful of all the beach is, they are doing the same thing
as when they're not at the beach -- imagining a better future rather
than being satisfied in the moment. Advocates who reward their own
growth with acknowledgment and celebration can strengthen the
experiences and rebalance their meaning. The following exercises can
help those who spend too much time focusing on the future: •

A day of fives: Set a timer or watch, preferably one that can be
randomized, to go off throughout the day. When it does, simply select a
nearby object and describe it in five unique single words -- avoid
phrases and sentences. There is no need to write them down or to
preserve the description in any way. It's not about the future. It's
about now.

•

Learn the name of everyone you talk to in a day. (But only if it's safe
to do so. In the supermarket, the school library, or the gym, for
example. Not every stranger on the street is to be trusted.)

•

Buy a small reward for yourself: an ice cream cone or a something silly
for your desk. Give it to yourself for being you. Make a fuss over it.
It may be a reward, but don't worry about what you did to earn it.

Advocates don't have to worry about becoming slackers when it comes to
their selfevolution. Finding ways to grow comes easily to them. However,
they may need to work on balancing their lives so that they appreciate
where they are as much as they focus on where they are going. The
Details Matter Personal growth can be somewhat esoteric and, depending
on the practice, may not always connect with daily life. Advocates
should be aware of the degree to which they

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

69

Advocates' Personal Growth

narrow their focus on other aspects of their lives to chase their ideal
self. After all, enlightened individuals still need to pay the electric
bill. Rebalancing may require developing a new relationship with
details. Sometimes the smaller things inform the larger things and bring
a sense of satisfaction. In Zen practice, the details of flowering
arranging, tea ceremonies, or even archery open the door to profound
experiences and understanding. Even if Zen is not their preferred path,
Advocates can learn many things by appreciating the finer points. The
following exercises may help: •

Construct three sets of rituals: one set for when you get up in the
morning; one set for the end of the work day, school day, or other
regular midday milestone; and a final set for bedtime. For each set,
include at least three activities but no more than six. They should be
small to medium tasks that should be done every day, such as making the
bed, showering, or brushing your teeth. Avoid anything that can't be
done in a fairly short amount of time. Try to do them in order every day
for the next week -- and beyond if it helps. Try to be as mindful as
possible during your rituals.

•

Make an ongoing appointment once a week to assess your financial
situation and to pay bills. Make it a habit by doing it at the same time
every week.

•

Find the messiest corner in the place you live and declutter. Pay
special attention to where you put the items you remove from the
offending spot and why you decided to do so.

Self-Responsibility Self-responsibility sounds simple, but it can be
difficult for many to achieve. Advocates who grasp a sense of
self-responsibility decide matters for themselves, "The Advocate" (INFJ,
-A/-T)

70

Advocates' Personal Growth

act independently, and follow interests without being excessively
reliant on the opinions or permission of others.

Balanced Self-Responsibility Morally Independent Responsibility is a
combination of action and attribution for that action. Advocates who
practice self-responsibility act after exploring their values, which
they use to achieve their goals. Attribution means they take full credit
or blame for the results of their actions. Scapegoating isn't part of
the equation for Advocates who have a strong sense of their personal
accountability. This personality type is likely to prefer a "moral"
course of action over one which is "not moral." That preference doesn't
mean they can't navigate moral gray areas or ambiguities; Advocates
explore ambiguities seriously before acting or deciding the merits of a
result. For them, a moral decision isn't always easy, but it does have
to be made. Advocates are successfully self-responsible if they run an
action and an attribution through their own ethical filters before,
during, and after, and they pass the test. Their moral framework doesn't
necessarily have to align with what society judges as moral.
Prioritizing Personal Growth Self-responsibility drives Advocates to
thrive. It demands they set priorities for big ideas and small ideas so
they can live according to the values they embrace. It speaks to the
sources of their self-esteem, self-respect, and self-confidence, and it
is fundamental to their self-evolution.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

71

Advocates' Personal Growth

When Advocates balance responsibilities, they set priorities around the
people in their lives; their own care and upkeep; and their causes,
whether a job they identify strongly with, a community program, or a
political or social movement. Priorities are important, and
self-responsible Advocates take them seriously. They are likely to link
their personal growth to meeting their responsibilities as they define
them and being accountable for the things they do.

Unbalanced Self-Responsibility Helplessness and Stagnation Advocates who
don't have a strong grasp on their responsibilities may eventually give
up trying to attend to them. Learned helplessness thwarts a person's
sense of control over their lives or their efforts, and it occurs after
repeated frustrations and a sense that they will never gain traction no
matter what they do. Soon people in this dilemma ask some variation of
"Why bother?" This lack of an internal locus of control, or the belief
that they can influence results in their lives, limits personal growth.
Because Advocates are so idealistic, their basic humanity can seem like
a flaw. "Not performing perfectly" often translates to "failure" for
Advocates who lack the proper perspective, leading to a loss of hope.
This false sense of helplessness may lead Advocates to try to find
satisfaction through damaging behaviors -- overindulging or letting
their goals and ambitions slip away. When they believe that they have no
way to control their lives and that nothing changes when they try, they
may see no point in having discipline. For Advocates, this is likely to
feel more serious than simply letting their duties slip. Because of the
moral overtones of their lives and their serious approach to matters,
abdication of

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

72

Advocates' Personal Growth

responsibility may result in a full-blown existential and moral crisis.
They may start to think of themselves as not just helpless people but as
bad helpless people. Without intervening success and a sense of
progress, Advocates experiencing learned helplessness may continue their
destructive habits or, in extreme cases, simply shut down. For example,
Advocates who believe that they are, and always will be, treated
unfairly may adopt the identity of someone who has been marked as "less
than" and lose their sense of power. This can start or continue a
vicious cycle of irresponsible behavior. Imagination Without Purpose
Advocates normally have a powerful focus, but when they are feeling
inferior, they can find too much comfort in their imaginations, where
they feel at home. Thus, they may have trouble keeping their minds
focused on tangible projects or plans that reflect their responsible
natures. They may allow themselves to remain too long in creative flow
of consciousness and may experience a chain of inspirations. However,
more concrete and responsible expressions of their creativity may never
come to fruition. During such times, it can be a challenge for them to
see a project or task through to the end.

Rebalancing Self-Responsibility Creating an Internal Locus of Control
Developing a strong internal locus of control can foil a sense of
helplessness, whether that helplessness is a result of some real outside
suppression or an imagined feeling formed within. Learning to recognize
negative self-talk and challenging it are important steps in discovering
or maintaining a positive perspective.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

73

Advocates' Personal Growth

To develop their self-responsibility, Advocates must direct their
attention with attentiveness and purpose. They should avoid losing
themselves to distractions (either internal or external).
Self-responsibility means taking responsibility for every part of life,
and focus is necessary to ensure that certain details aren't overlooked.
Sometimes attitudes affect behaviors, but behaviors affect attitudes
just as often. People should start where they can. If they have a good
attitude, that's a natural place to start. If they don't, a powerful
approach is to achieve a small success by disproving a helpless
attitude. Advocates can begin developing an internal locus of control by
dispelling negative self-talk and then picturing what they want from
life. Taking small, positive steps toward greater success can chip away
at a sense of helplessness. Here are some exercises to consider: •

Build success into your day. Make an appointment to do something each
day that demonstrates skill and effectiveness. It doesn't have to be a
significant activity -- just one that is guaranteed to succeed. Mind the
self-talk.

•

Mentally place things that come up during the day into one of two
columns: "Things I can control" and "Things I can't control." This is
about awareness, so there is no need to write them down. Just notice.

•

Try something new. Take up a sport or a hobby. Remember that beginners
are unlikely to do well in the beginning -- and that when starting out,
just trying is a success. Notice any self-talk. Be kind and aim to be
realistic. Harnessing Imagination

Advocates, especially when younger, may struggle to balance their desire
to make the world better with the run-away tendencies of their
imagination. An untamed

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

74

Advocates' Personal Growth

imagination can become overrun: When intriguing ideas are plentiful,
Advocates may have trouble focusing responsibly on just one. With
maturity and conscious decision-making, they can develop the ability to
filter out ideas that are exciting but not realistic, achievable, or
useful. Advocates can embrace their natural tendency to organize and
plan to ensure there is plenty of opportunity for both focus and
inspiration. At their best, Advocates are incredibly perceptive and
easily notice patterns and connections that may not be as visible to
other people. This allows them to plan and strategize better than many
other types. Still more impressively, Advocates organize systems based
on human beings rather than technology or methodology. Such an approach
unlocks far-reaching potential, as they tap into other people's talents
and ideas in an almost communal fashion. Nurturing the growth of others
can keep Advocates' attention as they align their values with their
efforts. Here are a few ways Advocates can harness their imaginations: •

Take a short time each day to allow daydreams to flow freely. Make an
appointment on the calendar for at least 10 minutes a day. Sit in the
park or stare out the window. Do nothing but allow a stream of
consciousness. Then go back to organized activities. Try it for a week.

•

Plan a group event, perhaps a party or a bowling night, that you can
realistically pull off. Try to get every member of the group involved.
You can put an imaginative, novel spin on it, and make it unique.

•

Innovation is not always about discovering something completely new.
Sometimes it involves changing an idea that isn't working. Search an
idea in your personal life. How can you change it?

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

75

Advocates' Personal Growth

It's hard to be responsible without focus. Advocates need to connect to
their values to discover the right motivations and then decisively
choose specific actions. When they manage their goals in this way, focus
is likely to accompany them throughout their efforts.

Conclusion It's hard to describe Advocates' personal growth without some
reference to spirituality. Some define spirituality as a person being
part of something bigger than themselves. Even those who lack a formal
spiritual practice or religion explore ideas that are bigger than they
are, such as growth and well-being for themselves and others.
Development depends on responding to what such explorations reveal.
Advocates who stick to their strengths and styles of being find that
growth is more likely to occur when they seek ways to be true to
themselves. Understanding their moral foundations and acting in ways
that honor them will create fulfillment and purpose for Advocates.
Learning to stand with integrity when they need to, yet be flexible and
open to feedback, will help this personality type discover a meaningful
path toward evolution and further development. Each Advocate has their
own spin, having adapted to their unique worlds in different ways. Some
skillfully navigate personal growth most of time. Others, some of the
time. And still others may struggle a lot. They may experience wonderful
growth some days, but other days ... not so much. But none will
experience life in any perfect way. Nonetheless, growth and learning are
always choices for those who are willing.

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

Not ones for casual encounters, Advocates treat the process of finding
romantic partners seriously. It's one of the most significant
investments they make toward happiness, so they proceed with care and
earnestness in their search for depth, meaning, and fulfillment. This
painstaking approach has its rewards -- once they've found their special
someone, they reach a level of interconnected harmony that most people
only dream of. Making the cut is challenging for potential partners,
especially if they're impatient, as Advocates tend to be perfectionistic
and picky. People with this personality type aren't easily talked into
things they don't want, and failure to respect that is a trespass
unlikely to be forgiven, particularly in the early stages of dating.
It's even worse if suitors resort to manipulation or dishonesty, as
Advocates have little patience for fakeness. One of the things Advocates
find most important in life is establishing genuine, deep connections
with individuals who share their desire for authenticity. They go out of
their way to avoid those who don't, especially when looking for love.
Advocates are

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

77

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

caring and insightful and can see past facades into others' thoughts and
emotions. These types may focus on the best in people, but they also see
the whole picture, warts and all. Inspired Love Advocates'
characteristic sense of wisdom and warmth allows them to
enthusiastically, repeatedly, and pleasantly surprise their lovers.
These types aren't afraid to unconditionally show their emotions, so
relationships with them aren't for the uncommitted or shallow. Advocates
look for connections that go beyond physical intimacy, embracing the
emotional and even spiritual bonds they have with their partners. They
are passionate, seeing intimacy as a way to express their love and make
their partners happy. They cherish not just the state of being in a
relationship, but becoming one with another person in mind and spirit.
Generous and warm, Advocates focus intently on their partners, and
reciprocity can be essential to this personality type. Their desire for
a deep bond means they need to see and feel the energy flowing back and
forth between themselves and their partners to be satisfied. For them,
thoughtful gestures and romantic symbolism help tangibly reaffirm what
they feel in their hearts and want to believe in their minds. They are
often genuinely affectionate and crave the same lush, devoted,
passionate attention in return. Self-Sacrificing Because of their desire
for powerful, warmly intimate connections with their partners, Advocates
sometimes find it hard to express even minor dissatisfaction within
their relationships. These types are so concerned with their partners'
happiness and crafting stable romances that they're reluctant to speak
up when their

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

78

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

needs aren't met. They may expect their lovers to step forward to make
their dreams come true, but they also tend to feel guilty about coming
across as "demanding" to the people they love. Advocates strive toward
ideal images in their minds that are full of romantic hopes and visions,
but even though they draw some joy from merely seeing the results of
their efforts, they also need personal attention and fulfillment. Too
much selfless humility can leave this type suffering inside, though they
might not always show it. This kind of silent martyrdom is an emotional
trap that's hard to free themselves from if they can't find ways to
fairly assert their needs. Even worse, when Advocates feel a lack of
care and respect in their relationships, they may grow jealous when
their partners show attention to others. Strong Expectations Giving too
much may have other unintended consequences as well, as Advocates'
intensity can go too far. Many people need a little personal space and
time, even within devoted, loving relationships. When Advocates blanket
their partners with too much attention -- or expectations of returned
attention -- it may cause even loving people to pull away, if only to
get some air now and then. Advocates may become alarmed if they only see
the withdrawal, not the reasons. Although constant connection is an
entirely understandable ideal, Advocates tend to be a lot happier when
they don't expect to always be their lovers' number one priority. Just
as they might want a little time to themselves, their partners also
benefit from their own company or the company of other people some of
the time. Constant togetherness doesn't always support the growth of
Advocates' strength and freedom within romantic relationships, and it
may simply be too much for some types. Finding

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

79

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

fulfillment within themselves is just as critical when they are in
relationships as when they are not; the above Personal Growth chapter is
good to keep in mind while reading this and other sections as well.

Potential Role Pairings Finding a satisfying relationship isn't always
easy, especially for a type so concerned with authenticity and depth.
Advocates are never ones to settle for a shallow, general view of things
-- they seek the hidden dimensions and mysteries of life. Whether
Analysts or Explorers, Sentinels or fellow Diplomats, everyone has
something unique and beautiful to bring to their relationships. This
creates many opportunities, and some challenges (which, to wise
Advocates, are just opportunities by another name). The following
section looks at the potential interplay of different Roles to help
Advocates striving to understand and develop their relationships.

Advocate--Analyst Relationships

Comfortable with ideas and abstractions, Advocates and Analysts share a
visionary, open-minded view of the world that can spark quick fireworks
between them. These "The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

80

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

personality types offer their partners virtues that complement their
approaches, but which aren't always easy for them to master by
themselves. When they move more deeply into romantic relationships,
their collective inspiration and creativity form bonds of mutual
respect, and sometimes incredible growth.

Balanced Advocate--Analyst Relationships Divine Creativity Both Analysts
and Advocates love forward-thinking, and they want to get deep into any
matter. For Advocates, this means seeking the human heart of an issue,
whereas Analysts' goal is to achieve an in-depth understanding of the
facts. When combined, these two distinct perspectives almost perfectly
compensate for each other's inherent weaknesses and limitations. In
balanced partnerships, these types share their approaches with each
other, opening doors to new information, creative concepts, and plans
for the future -- endless subjects for conversation and discovery
together. Reinforcing Each Other's Abilities More than just inspired
thoughts, Advocates bring real warmth and intimacy into their partners'
lives -- qualities that Analysts often struggle to understand or express
but find enchanting nonetheless. Advocates often lead Analysts into
better comprehension of human intricacies and the world of romance
itself, offering rewards that go far beyond logic. In turn, Analysts
welcome their partners into their world of rationality, where love isn't
just about a feeling, it's about recognizing and appreciating compelling
reasons to be together. When Analysts devote themselves to Advocates,
it's with their heads as well as their hearts. Advocates intent on their
personal growth may find Analysts to be valued sounding boards for their
ideas.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

81

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

Advocates appreciate how their Analyst partners' inspiration is tempered
with deduction; their sharp perspective can illuminate real
opportunities for positive change. Analysts offer Advocates the benefit
of a thoughtful stance on emotionally charged issues, as well as
guidance on critical thinking itself -- they love to see their partners
temper their admirable passion with thoughtful consideration. When in
balance together, these two marry creative, idealistic fervor with cool
reasoning, their mental cooperation becoming an enduring source of
personal growth and inspiration.

Unbalanced Advocate--Analyst Relationships Head vs. Heart Differing
natural approaches to romantic gestures and emotional expression often
challenge these couples; without personal balance and awareness, this
can become a real problem. For example, Analysts may think that giving
flowers, only to have them sit in a vase to die, is a somewhat
superficial or even dishearteningly transient gesture. However,
Advocates may see the beauty of the flowers as a deeper symbol of
appreciation, even if the petaled conveyors of the message are
short-lived. Analysts might not always be sensitive to Advocates'
perception of emotional connections between people, things, and actions,
so they may forego many of the sentimental rituals of courtship, or else
just go through the motions to meet expectations. But Advocates know
when gestures don't come from the heart, and they may feel disappointed
as a result. What can seem like meaningless demonstrations to Analysts
who are out of touch with their partners' needs can, in fact, be very
potent sources of emotional connection for Advocates, especially during
times of trouble.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

82

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

Such troubled times may bring up another issue for these couples, as
Analysts often try to cleverly fix Advocates' problems when their
partners instead crave heartfelt sympathy and support. This misstep can
get Analysts into hot water, as Advocates may be upset by offers of what
they regard as cold logic rather than much-desired emotional soothing.
If Advocates take their discontent too far, they may utterly fail to see
the sincere concern behind Analysts' efforts, instead becoming hurt and
resentful. Tripping over Their Grandiosity Conflict aside, a potential
shared problem for Advocate--Analyst couples is a lack of follow-through
on routine aspects of life. Analysts tend to excel at devising
innovative ideas but may fall just as short as their Advocate partners
when it comes to everyday matters, as both types favor creative pursuits
instead. When these partners involve themselves too much with personal
interests or ideas for the future, practical concerns often slip by,
leaving unpleasant consequences in their wake. These couples may allow
dirty laundry and debt to pile up around them when they are distracted
by their arcane ideas. These same passionate, lofty constructs can cause
discord when these lovers differ -- Advocates' passionate idealism can
crash abruptly against Analysts' dispassionate assessments. When these
types get carried away by their active imaginations, they can lose their
sense of balance: Advocates become overly outraged when their think
their dreams are being marginalized, and Analysts act overly critical,
caring more about proving themselves right than opening their minds.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

83

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

Rebalancing Advocate--Analyst Relationships Appreciating Each Other's
Ways To help rebalance their differing ways of showing emotion,
Advocates can encourage Analysts to explore their sentimentality,
reminding them that symbolic, romantic gestures are important
affirmations in relationships. By making a point of showing appreciation
when their Analyst lovers make any conscious efforts to grow emotionally
(knowing that the sincerity of their attempts matters more than any
clumsiness in their approach), Advocates can teach Analysts how to meet
their emotional needs without prompting or artifice. Their artless
reactions of joy can help Analysts realize the importance of developing
emotional connections in their relationships. Advocates should also
recognize that approaching problems and emotional issues with cool
rationality has value, and it is often how Analysts express their love.
To put it metaphorically, Analysts show care by trying to cure an
illness rather than merely soothe the symptoms. If Advocates can see the
loving energy that motivates Analysts' version of thoughtfulness, then
they can draw emotional satisfaction even from somewhat unromantic
contributions to the relationship. A few steps both types can take to
work toward meeting each other's emotional needs: •

Communicate needs promptly and respectfully -- don't hide them.

•

Seek out needs -- Analysts (and some Advocates) may not be very
forthcoming.

•

Acknowledge each other's needs verbally.

•

Act on each other's needs willingly.

•

Appreciate acts of caring even when they're not overtly emotional.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

84

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

•

Encourage each other toward further demonstrative action with gratitude
and praise.

Rebalancing differences in emotional expressivity may be challenging for
these couples, but taking deliberate action and treating each other
patiently will bring balance. Staying Grounded Exploring lofty ideas
together is one of the great joys of this pairing, but wise
Advocate--Analyst lovers find balance by scheduling life's practical
matters deliberately. Mutual attention to daily priorities and deadlines
can help keep their shared environment working smoothly. These partners
can also volunteer to take on more responsibility in areas that suit
them. For example, Advocates could play a bigger role in directing their
shared social relationships, while Analysts could do more research in
"technical areas" like auto financing and trip planning. When both types
value each other's capabilities, their differing strengths combine to
wonderfully complement each other. These partners should work on
appreciating the importance of completing these mundane
responsibilities, instead of merely rolling their eyes at them. Even
though shifting internal narratives and priorities to complete tedious
tasks may be a challenge for these types, both appreciate the results:
Advocates appreciate things being orderly and secure, and Analysts see
the rationale in keeping life functioning. To increase motivation, these
couples can share rewards with each other, including grateful praise and
a little indulgence. When acting responsibly results in something
pleasant, it's far easier to keep everyday matters and chores
up-to-date. Some useful steps to consider:

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

85

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

•

Write a plan together, including a timetable, for accomplishing common
responsibilities.

•

Agree to share tasks according to aptitude and interest, but make things
equal overall.

•

Perform tasks together or apart, as desired.

•

Reward each other for a job well done with treats and thanks.

It's not always fun to work on life's little necessities, but it's a lot
better than always being distracted by dysfunction. With their combined
imaginations, Advocate-- Analyst couples can get things done together
without losing their spark of fun and creativity. Above All Else, Love
When it comes to differences in beliefs, ideas, or imagination,
Advocates and Analysts should understand that they need not be
reconciled. For these creative types, divergent thoughts are a wonderful
part of who they are. When treading through the realm of ideas, they may
walk paths apart from the norm, society, and even each other. However,
it's not necessary to prove others wrong or convert their way of
thinking. These couples would be wise to focus on the underlying desire
they have for each other that transcends ideological positions. Balanced
relationships between Advocates and Analysts demonstrate respect for
each other's views; even if they don't share an opinion, it need not
interfere with love or cooperation. A key realization here is that these
types can coordinate and compromise on practical matters of life, but
they don't necessarily need to do so when pursuing personal interests or
creative projects.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

86

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

For example, politics, religion, and philosophy may all be set aside to
allow connections that provide much more direct fulfillment in their
daily lives. Dedicated to principles, Advocates can have difficulty
relaxing their views, but they understand that harmony in relationships
requires unique souls to resonate together, not identically. Likewise,
Analysts who want to create balanced relationships must learn when to
quit arguing over every little detail and embrace the loving feeling
that can exist even among very different people. A few tips: •

When things get tense, take a moment to remember your core connection to
each other.

•

Decide together that the issue is less important than that connection.

•

Accept that each of you has a right to your own views.

•

Refocus on something tangible that matters to both of you.

Although these types may both become absorbed in their own minds, the
lure of what they can share together keeps them connected. The love,
passion, and intimacy are worth deciding to be accepting.

Advocate--Diplomat Relationships

Advocates and other Diplomats build relationships that are deep,
significant, and idealistic. Diplomats give their romantic partners
special status in their lives -- they may feel they "complete" each
other. These types see growth as a virtue, happily viewing their
partners as works in progress. Admiring and encouraging each other's
aspirations, they support their partners as they learn and grow. This
level of energy channeled into an interconnected life can be intense,
but Advocate--Diplomat couples revel in intense connections. As if they
have a psychic link, they feel each other's troubles easily, and they
offer comfort and counsel at just the right times.

Balanced Advocate--Diplomat Relationships Inspired Harmony When they
form romantic relationships, Advocates and their Diplomat partners revel
in inspiring each other's imaginations. Though even the rare
Advocate--Advocate couple may still have their differences, fellow
Diplomats take interest in each other's creative dreams. Progress,
harmony, and kindness are essential qualities that create common ground
for these partners to understand each other's goals in life. As these

88

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

lovers guide each other into new, inspiring territory, they discover
surprising, colorful worlds of possibility. Healing and Support
Advocates and Diplomats like to practice empathy, and such couples
connect on a deeper level than perhaps any other types. This very
satisfying sharing and understanding can result in unmatched warmth and
sensitivity in their personal lives, especially if they share a home.
One thing that makes this pairing special is that Advocates and
Diplomats don't hold their empathy only between themselves -- they want
to share it with the world. Nothing gives these couples more
satisfaction than connecting with other kindred souls, especially toward
grand ends that reflect their values. If these lovers decide to make
their dreams into reality, they can be powerful partners in helping
themselves -- and others. Their principles are likely to reflect a
desire for equality, justice, and peace, and being so in sync with each
other provides great fulfillment when they are working together toward
these goals. Whether it's occasionally volunteering together for a
worthy cause they feel strongly about or just living their lives as
purely as they can, their commonality of spirit provides great
opportunities for them to grow closer.

Unbalanced Advocate--Diplomat Relationships Inflaming Each Other All the
wonderful ways in which Diplomats' emotions mix and flow are mirrored by
unpleasant potential as well. The strong, constant connections that
often characterize relationships between Advocates and other Diplomats
can sometimes

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

89

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

grow overwhelming, and these couples may feel stifled or even aggravated
by too much togetherness. When constantly together, they may lack the
room to think clearly, resulting in unbalanced decision-making and a
subtle build-up of stress. Introverted types such as Advocates may
especially feel stressed by constant company. These couples also tend to
struggle with overly idealistic expectations for their relationships.
Disappointment may occur when the reality sinks in that no one is
perfect. Advocates may become critical as they notice even minor flaws
in their Diplomat partners -- and vice versa. The contrast between
expectations and real people makes it hard for these types to reconcile
their complicated feelings of hope and love -- unbalanced couples
believe only in the best possible outcomes, and anything less seems
horribly lacking. Unrealistic Priorities Routine life management is also
likely to be a problem for Advocate--Diplomat couples, even when other
aspects of their relationships are good. As distracted with ideas as any
two Intuitive types might be, these partners may start to feel lost and
overwhelmed as neglected chores accumulate. Unfortunately, their
response to mounting tasks is often procrastination, or even outraged
protest as mundane responsibilities threaten their loftier goals. These
types often allow unfinished business to grow around them like a jungle,
and cutting a path out rarely comes easily. One of the worst possible
consequences of a shared dysfunctional lifestyle is blame. When
Advocate--Diplomat couples feel the stressful consequences of
procrastination or irresponsibility, their unbalanced response is often
to judge each other. In truth,

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

90

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

they may have both participated equally in creating the overall mass of
problems, but each may criticize the other's failings, placing broader
blame at each other's feet for the unhappy results cropping up around
them both. It's painful to accept responsibility, and unbalanced
partners may decide that it's far easier to blame the situation on each
other than on own their mistakes.

Rebalancing Advocate--Diplomat Relationships Finding Allowance
Advocate--Diplomat couples, with their constant focus on each other's
feelings, sometimes forget that emotions rise and fall like tides -- a
process that sometimes should be finished in solitude instead of always
being confronted and experienced together. When emotions are running
high and one partner needs space, the other can consider a hands-off
method of support, temporarily withdrawing instead of sharing too much
emotion. These couples can also temper their own emotional expectations
of each other and their relationships. Advocates and Diplomats honor
their partners by allowing them their flaws -- it's a great act of love
to accept imperfection, and balanced couples regard lofty expectations
as inspirations, not requirements. Simply reveling in each other's
presence now and then is an important and healthy emotional expression,
as is requesting personal solitude. Setting aside time for joyful
moments together that don't place heavy demands on each other is a great
way to reconnect. Some ideas to balance time together and apart include:
•

Clearly express any need for solitude or time to process emotions.

•

Grant each other space with a respectful and supportive attitude.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

91

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

•

Rejoin after alone time and verbally affirm appreciation for the
support.

•

Engage in something pleasant, simple, and immediate together (watch a
movie, make dinner, go for a walk).

•

Use these moments to focus on each other in the present without bringing
up the future or the past.

•

Plan similar "in-the-moment" breaks throughout the week -- they needn't
be long or involved, but making them frequent is invaluable.

Giving each other space to be emotional without judgment is critical, as
is appreciating that space, but it's just as important to find ways to
be together without constantly needing the heady feedback of deep
emotional exchange. It can be exhausting. Being Responsible Advocates
and their Diplomat partners can also rebalance their shared life by
ensuring that practical matters are attended to together. Deep,
meaningful conversations may be immensely rewarding, but it's sometimes
necessary to talk about bills and chores, too. Both types may focus on
higher personal goals than laundry, but by forming cooperative goals and
following through, balanced couples support each other's attention to
mundane responsibilities. Advocates have a special advantage in this
area, as the Judging trait contributes to their desire for planned
order. One technique Advocates can use -- and kindly share with their
Diplomat partners -- is to deliberately make their personal interests
dependent on completing tasks and responsibilities. For example,
Advocates might tell themselves that they're not going to stream their
favorite show until the dishes are done, or perhaps they can watch and
wash at the same time.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

92

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

Some ways to prioritize mundane but necessary tasks: •

Discuss issues of shared life maintenance together.

•

Write a to-do list together in order of priority.

•

Claim and complete at least one item per person per day, cooperating
whenever possible.

•

Update the list every day with new items as needed, and proudly cross
off accomplishments.

•

Engage in personal indulgences together after necessary work is done.

Advocate--Diplomat couples must focus on taking action. They don't lack
for ideas or enthusiasm, but gentle, firm commitment to finish things
together is critical.

Advocate--Sentinel Relationships

If not always likely to share the same specific dreams, these types
nonetheless find appealing commonality in their sense of dedication.
Advocates' adherence to their values appeals to Sentinels' sense of what
is right and fair, and their mutual focus on this builds trust. However,
Advocates offer their lovers more than just agreement -- they inspire
Sentinels to think bigger, even as they respect their stable
practicality.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

93

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

Balanced Advocate--Sentinel Relationships Mutual Care Advocates and
Sentinels both love to nurture and protect their loved ones: Sentinels
by creating and preserving stability, and Advocates by fostering values
and offering emotional support. Both types regard a deep, trusting
connection as an essential part of all relationships, and they commit
intensely once they find their significant others. Advocates may find
that their fanciful imaginations and idealism fascinate and attract
Sentinels who are ready to expand their horizons a little. The
revolutionary views of Advocates may be challenging at times, but
Sentinels consider these partners' unconventional perspectives equally
alongside the enduring, traditional truths they hold dear. Left to
themselves, Sentinels may avoid change, but their love and trust open
them to the unabashed hope, encouragement, and imagination that
Advocates bring into their lives. Advocates love idealistic progress,
but they also love Sentinels for the prudent caution that, from a less
trusted source, might feel like a dampening of their ideas. Sentinels
help their partners compose their thoughts more practically by making
supportive contributions that don't diminish Advocates' dreams, but
instead help them become beautiful realities. Exploring Humanity
Sentinels are very focused on values, but Advocates open them even more
to people's incredibly complex uniqueness -- they love to examine the
human core of any issue. When Sentinels get frustrated by people's
seeming unpredictability, Advocates' insight into human motivations
helps them understand and stabilize their personal relationships.
Tolerance as an ideal can make life easier by relieving friction,

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

94

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

and Sentinels practice this virtue better with the helpful empathy of
their Advocate partners. Stability, in turn, is a value that Sentinels
help their Advocate partners develop, especially when it comes to human
interactions. Advocates tend to operate heavily in the realm of ideas,
and they are profoundly affected by their social encounters. When
Sentinels see them getting pulled in too many directions at once or
reacting too strongly to social situations, they tend to gently remind
their lovers of the solid reality right in front of them. Their love
helps keep Advocates focused on established aspects of their social
lives, not just potential.

Unbalanced Advocate--Sentinel Relationships Out-of-Sync Perspectives The
difference between what is practical and what is possible is a common
issue in Advocate--Sentinel relationships. Over time, Advocates may find
Sentinel partners questioning their choices, perhaps expressing
unwelcome expectations that Advocates will settle down and stabilize.
Advocates have powerful imaginations, and they sometimes get preoccupied
with chasing impossible dreams. While spending too much time trying to
rearrange the universe in their minds, Advocates might fail to recognize
that their Sentinel partners may see revolutionary changes as threats to
their hard-earned security. When this happens, even the most patient and
loving Sentinels may begin to doubt the relevance of their partners'
priorities in life, as well as their future together. Problems can be
introduced into the relationship by either of these partners, though.
Sentinels live in a world of rules and traditions, and if they become
too rigid in their thinking, they may completely dismiss their Advocate
lovers' utopian dreams as

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

95

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

immature or impractical. Sentinels can become very critical when things
they see as necessary in life are challenged or left unaddressed by
their partners. This kind of disapproving behavior is very hurtful to
Advocates; it's like telling them they are foolish for their beliefs and
ideas. Advocates vehemently dislike being suppressed or disrespected,
especially for their high hopes. Transformational, soul-searching talk
from Advocates may baffle Sentinels, but by focusing exclusively on
tradition and security, Sentinels may miss authentic opportunities for
personal growth and advancement in life. Growth-oriented Advocates may
eventually become bored with plans that are all about conventional
living and respond too harshly with impatient criticism and pressure to
change, further widening the gap between them. Lopsided Roles The
differences between Advocate imagination and Sentinel practicality may
become troublesome in subtle, insidious ways. In unbalanced
relationships, they may begin to take on roles of authority and
subordinate, like parent and child or boss and employee. Advocates love
to dream and talk, but those who fail to follow through with sustained
action (especially on matters that aren't interesting to them) aren't
being fair in a loving relationship, and Sentinels may naturally pick up
the slack. This may or may not be a source of irritation; some couples
are quite happy to compensate for each other, finding a kind of balance.
However, most Sentinels are likely to want balanced contributions of
effort from committed partners, and they may become frustrated if
they're forced to shoulder most of the practical responsibilities.
Sentinels who face lopsided burdens for too long may begin to act like
angry, nagging parents. In response, Advocates who don't

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

96

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

value these necessary tasks and issues equally may act resentful, as
though they are being forced to do things they don't want to. This
pattern can result in a lot of discord and frustration for both types,
causing what should merely be matters of shared attention to become
threats to the relationship.

Rebalancing Advocate--Sentinel Relationships Learning from Each Other's
Perspectives Finding practical approaches to imaginative ends together
may help Advocate-- Sentinel couples appreciate each other's unique
lifestyles. Sentinels can help Advocates by adding a bit of considered
sensibility to their enthusiastic inspiration, as Advocates can grow by
listening to the moderating voice of Sentinel partners and seeing their
functional methods as helpful for reaching lofty goals. Advocates may
also find they're less distracted by daily annoyances as their partners
create stability around them. Advocates can show their appreciation,
recognizing not only the personal advantages of this order, but also how
profoundly important it is to their partners. Advocates want to bring
positive change, and those trying to coax their Sentinel partners out of
their shell can rebalance their sometimes-strident efforts by
cultivating a gentle, understanding approach. They can protect their
Sentinel partners from changes that seem too sudden or risky, then help
them progress at an acceptable pace. Sentinels value security, and when
their relationships offer deep safety and support, they may realize they
can be less rigid about their approach to life. Wise Sentinels challenge
themselves to set foot on a more audacious path now and then, holding
their Advocate partners' hands for support and knowing that they're
respected and loved.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

97

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

The following tips may help both types move forward: •

Seek ways to tap into each other's unique strengths.

•

Allow time to process new ideas and experiences before engaging in them.

•

Respect each other's limits and sensitivities to change.

•

Show appreciation for each other's assistance and good judgement.

In balanced relationships, Sentinels create reliability and stability,
crafting a foundation that allows these lovers to advance in life;
Advocates, always looking to the future, expand just how far they can go
together. Acting Like Equals If a contentious, unequal dynamic develops
because one type finds themselves pressuring the other to participate in
shared obligations, both partners need to evaluate their own attitudes.
Balancing differences in fundamental priorities is challenging, but
that's no excuse for demeaning each other. Advocates who fail to make
enough realistic contributions to the relationship demean Sentinels to a
caretaker role, and Sentinels who demean Advocates' abilities are
insulting -- it's no way for adults to treat each other. It's important
for Advocates to realize that it isn't their partners throwing
unpleasant responsibilities on them -- choosing to live as a couple
comes with its own demands. The fact that Sentinel partners are
concerned with these responsibilities and try to highlight their
importance reflects deep concern for their mutual well-being. Instead of
resenting life's demands, Advocates can affirm their own power and
growth by joining Sentinels in creating a satisfying life together.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

98

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

For their part, Sentinels can work to respect that the Advocates they
love have certain lofty priorities that are profoundly important to
them. Sentinels may not always understand Advocates' focus on
possibility, but they can rebalance by seeing their partners'
high-reaching inspiration not as immaturity, but as admirable ambition.
Furthermore, when Advocates choose to take equal roles in accomplishing
things that matter to Sentinels, it's only fair -- and loving -- for
their partners to return that effort. These couples can focus on these
basic steps to help: •

Discuss each other's priorities for a life together.

•

Work toward each other's goals.

•

Don't wait to be asked for participation; take individual action.

•

Offer to help each other whenever possible. Actively seek opportunities
to cooperate.

Advocates can keep in mind that working to match Sentinels' sense of
responsibility is a wonderful, self-affirming expression of power, which
ties into developing the qualities mentioned in the Personal Growth
chapter.

Advocate--Explorer Relationships

Advocates' heads are full of creative ideas and dreams, and Explorers
are curious about everything -- these two don't take long to find common
ground. Advocates' focus on the intangible can be intriguing to
Explorers, opening them to new frontiers of exploration. In turn,
Explorers' sense of curious, vigorous engagement is perfect for helping
Advocates step out of their thoughts and into experiences. Explorers
think nothing of grabbing hold of life with both hands, a perfect
balance for Advocates' sometimes cerebral reservation.

Balanced Advocate--Explorer Relationships Differing Focus, Mutual
Passion Explorers' focus on hands-on pursuits is far from limited, as
they may change their minds often, and Advocates may come to see their
dauntless attempts at mastery as inspired. Where Advocates may think
about broad changes they'd like to see, Explorers demonstrate the power
of single-minded effort, developing their own potential as they follow
their interests. Their fascination can be infectious, and it may even
inspire Advocates to act on their own goals -- and, of course, Explorers
are game to help. Although the scope of their focus may differ,
Advocate--Explorer couples "The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

100

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

share a passion for the things that are important to them. When love
aligns their interests, these two types become partners, progressing
together as they work to overcome barriers both personal and external.
Neither is likely to give up when they have a goal in mind. Joyful
Discovery Balanced romantic relationships between these two types are
truly exciting -- full of energy and unexpected experiences. Advocates
are enthralled by Explorers' free spirit, their enthusiasm for living in
the moment, and their willingness to seize opportunity. Fascinated by
their desire for freedom and novelty, Advocates find Explorers to be
thrilling company. Similarly, ever-curious Explorers are easily
intrigued by the almost mystical essence that surrounds Advocates. When
these two find love together, they give each other a long path of
discovery and excitement. Although their individual tastes may be
infinitely varied, any shared interests give these types an excellent
opportunity for fun times together. Advocates think in terms of "what
ifs," and Explorer partners are likely to respond with, "Let's go do
it." These couples find much joy and excitement in each other's company,
both in public and private. They may also share immediate passion:
Advocates because they revel in the intimacy, and Explorers because they
can be happily impulsive, rarely denying themselves their desires. In
love, this isn't a bad thing.

Unbalanced Advocate--Explorer Relationships Conflicting Approaches to
Life Advocates often focus on the welfare and feelings of other people,
while Explorers sometimes set these same concerns aside. Entrepreneurs,
the Explorer type that's

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

101

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

polar opposite of Advocates, exemplify this spirit, often boldly
disregarding anything beyond their own motivations and goals. If
Advocates see such people as selfish, they may go too far in criticizing
or even condemning them. When accused this way, Explorers may label
their Advocate partners as too rigid and unrealistic out of resentment.
Advocates want to cooperate, especially with their partner, but they may
draw firm lines based on their own values, which can lead to fierce
disagreement. Both Advocates and Explorers can be dedicated to their
perspectives, and when unbalanced stubbornness takes over, Advocates may
provoke fierce resistance by pushing Explorer partners too hard to
examine themselves. In turn, Explorers may not always understand
Advocates' world of ideas, and when they become exasperated, they may
simply walk away. Explorers often just want to accomplish goals that
matter to them, and imposed rules may begin to feel like a loss of
essential freedom. In Their Own Worlds The tendency of Advocates to live
inside their heads may make their more experience-oriented Explorer
lovers feel alone in their hands-on pursuits. Explorers find little
compulsion to spend time in the realm of pure imagination -- they want
to experiment with their ideas, not just develop them as guiding
principles. When unbalanced, both these types may fail to find any
enthusiasm for each other's personal interests, and they may not be
respectful enough of their partners as a result. This disconnect may
also happen with typical events and matters of daily life. When
unbalanced, these couples often don't devote enough time to working
together on everyday tasks that affect them both. Although motivated in
their pursuit of personal

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

102

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

goals, Explorers are no fonder of uninspiring chores than Advocates --
they'd both rather do something fun. This avoidance may make them happy
at first, but by staying in their own worlds instead of dealing with
responsibilities together, longlasting happiness may be at risk.

Rebalancing Advocate--Explorer Relationships Stepping into Experiences
Together Finding ways to de-stress and experience sheer joyful abandon
through shared activities are great ways to start to rebalance these
relationships. Advocates are likely to ruminate on the meaning of life,
the universe, and everything, so action-oriented Explorer partners may
be the perfect people to drag them out of their mind-palaces to relax
and indulge a bit. Advocates enjoy beauty, form, and culture, and
Explorers like to experience new and exciting things, making common
recreational ground easy to find. With a little work and time -- and by
taking themselves a little less seriously -- Advocate--Explorer couples
can learn to embrace each other's differences. Advocates and their
Explorer partners may also find common ground by occasionally stepping
into each other's worlds. Explorers can work to support their Advocate
partners' lofty beliefs and ideas by contributing their own considerable
energy and skills out of love, if not always deep personal interest. In
turn, Advocates can rebalance by occasionally putting aside impassioned
concerns about society and instead work on exploring things their
partners care about -- their values can be served by going deeper into
the connection they share. Some strategies these couples can try: •

Have fun together. Roll with the bumps and try new things often.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

103

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

•

Take turns engaging each other's interests, but don't be too demanding
of each other.

•

Kindly give each other a little recovery time after fun and excitement
-- alone if needed.

Advocates can appreciate the passion that their Explorer partners have
for engaging the moment, and they may enjoy focusing on something
exciting together. It's just a matter of these lovers ensuring that each
other's interests receive some attention. Getting Real Everyday life
should flow smoothly enough that it doesn't distract from their higher
goals, and Advocates and Explorers can overcome the risk of chores
piling up by actively sharing mundane things. Balancing personal time
and interests with shared responsibilities is critical in any
relationship, and these types are wise to make a special effort to make
their lives functional. It's also imperative to thank each other for
contributions; feeling appreciated goes a long way to ease the burden of
such chores. Advocates and Explorers don't need to face everything
themselves, though, and there's no shame in seeking assistance. With
these couples, hiring outside help often makes a positive difference, as
neither takes much satisfaction from household responsibilities. Balance
doesn't mean drudgery, and there's nothing wrong with outsourcing areas
of life that bring no satisfaction to either of these types, if
feasible. If not, a little music and some good company can make
attacking chores together a lot more fun. Some tips:

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

104

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

•

Decide to be responsible together.

•

Ensure that enough time is spent on necessary life tasks as well as
personal interests.

•

Consider hiring help for the least rewarding chores.

•

When things must be done, choose to do them together and make them as
painless as possible.

Taking some time to handle daily issues together may not always be fun
and exciting -- but it can be if these two types add their imagination
and zest for life to routine tasks and projects.

Conclusion Embracing Possibilities A consistent theme throughout
Advocates' lives is the thoughtful intention to foster harmony and
progress in themselves, the world, and especially their relationships
with other people. When it comes to romantic love, these types are wise
to maintain their ideals, but they should also look past their exacting
views to embrace the varied, grand possibilities that await. With
understanding and tolerance, love can be built and sustained beautifully
between Advocates and any other type. There is no perfect match between
types, only wonderfully satisfying matches between people who feel drawn
to each other and are willing to forgive mistakes, learn, and grow
together. The information we've provided in this chapter can help
Advocates on their journey of understanding, both of themselves and
their relationships. It's not always easy to get an accurate sense of
just how differently other people think and feel, especially for a type
whose perceptions are so tightly bound to their hopes and ideals.

Advocates' Romantic Relationships

about other types' needs helps Advocates increase the objectivity of
their own insights, enabling even deeper connections with those who
occupy that most special place in their hearts. Moving Forward Together
To Advocates, the best romantic relationships aren't passive. They
aren't only about shared laughs and pleasure; in the long term, they
also include conscious, progressive action together. When lovers happily
occupy large portions of each other's lives, the less glamorous or
pleasant aspects of those lives also become intertwined. Everyone has
flaws and baggage, and expecting each other to handle such things alone
or out of sight doesn't create the kind of interconnected relationships
that Advocates crave. Rebalancing is all about facing each other's
issues with patience, love, and forgiveness, and taking deliberate steps
together in the real world to work things out. Advocates love to think,
dream, and understand things in their heads, but thought is only the
first stage of progress, in life and in love. Finding practical ways to
cooperate and compromise with romantic partners is key to moving forward
together. This applies to achieving hopes and dreams, as well as
maintaining personal freedom and individuality. The rebalancing sections
above give just some ideas on how Advocates and their partners can
respect each other while getting what they need to be happy. Although
it's unrealistic to believe that any relationship will be all sunshine,
it's fully possible to master difficult times together and walk out the
other side smiling, hand in hand -- Advocates can create this happy path
for themselves and with those they love.

Advocates' Friendships

Advocates make for warmly supportive friends. As with any other pursuit
in their lives, these types bring their visionary qualities to their
friendships: Given time and the opportunity to build trust with
accepting individuals, Advocates share much of their rich inner lives.
However, sharing doesn't always come easily to this Introverted type,
whose firm values protect a fragile inner core. Advocates need to feel
that their treasured ideas and values are in safe hands. Part of the
trust they express comes from knowing that their friends understand them
on a deeper level. It may take a while for Advocates to form solid
friendships, and early impressions can strongly affect the length of
this process. In friendship, it's as though Advocates are searching for
a kind of soulmate, with whom they can discover hope for the future
regardless of the circumstances of the present. These types are
insightful and tend to weed out those who don't share their deep
idealism. As Advocates share more with potential friends, they conduct a
quiet assessment to determine whether interests are mutual enough and
trust is present. Although Advocates will likely end up with just a few
true friends -- maybe even just one -- the friendships they keep are the
result of a rich mutual understanding that forges a permanent bond. "The

where the only thing they have in common is day-today familiarity.
However, Advocates may get more attention and popularity than they care
to receive. Their quiet and determined idealism, creative expression,
and aura of thoughtful support naturally draw others to them. Although
they like their true friendships to be deep, Advocates also love to
connect on a more recreational, lighthearted level. They are witty and
imaginative, and sharing fun experiences with another human being
carries a strange allure. Enhancing Their Perspective Advocates tend to
have distinct views that favor idealism over reality, but they
appreciate their friends for their minds and spirits, as well as how
their influence and ideas contribute to the friendship. Advocates
benefit from balancing their own vision with their friends' ideas,
creating a more complete picture of life; a trusted friend can provide a
different and valuable viewpoint. Expanding their focus and being open
to an evolving mindset move Advocates forward in life, and their
abundant empathy opens the door to deep bonds that bring refreshed
perspectives.

Advocates' Friendships

Advocates may sometimes feel defensive against the world at large, but
the special relationships they can form with friends provide relief from
that friction, even if they don't see eye-to-eye on everything. In
friendship, this type can hear contrasting views without perceiving them
as challenges or insults -- and this is one of the most valuable aspects
of a deep, trusting friendship. Advocates can be among the most stubborn
types, but when they feel in their hearts that a friend cares for and
respects them, they trust their instincts and lower the blast shields to
hear different thoughts and ideas.

Advocates and Friends from Other Roles Advocates are specialists at
seeing the best in other people. They are compassionate and generously
offer conscious acts of appreciation that make them highly valued as
friends, even to those with very different natures. Maturity, wisdom,
and mutual respect can help create rewarding friendships between
Advocates and all of the other personality types. Any pairing can be an
interesting adventure for this friendly, if outwardly reserved, type.
Knowing there may be occasional glitches in some potential friendships
doesn't discourage them. Advocates rarely give up on a friend once they
grow close, and all types appreciate such sincere dedication -- it's an
uncommon and valuable quality that Advocates can be proud of. Let's
examine the challenges and joys that Advocates are likely to face in
friendships with others belonging to each of the major Roles: Analysts,
other Diplomats, Sentinels, and Explorers.

Advocate--Analyst Friendships

For Advocates, having an Analyst across the table can feel like having
an extension of their own minds, expanding their perspective. In
friendship, Advocates and Analysts can blend these tendencies to create
balance and achieve great things. When these friends work together, they
combine dreamy inspiration and technical thinking, taking turns fitting
each other's goals into their unique worldviews.

Balanced Advocate--Analyst Friendships Beautifully Constructed
Possibilities Analysts enjoy using their inherent rationality to play
the role of advisor, priding themselves on the logic and impartiality
they can contribute to Advocates' way of thinking. Where others may be
inclined to provide support mainly out of loyalty or sensitivity,
Analysts can be bluntly truthful with even their closest friends.
Advocates may see this honesty as a blessing and a challenge. Having
everything they say go through Analysts' rational filters can take some
getting used to. However, Advocates usually come to trust in the
benefits of adding a critically perceptive vantage point to their own.
What's more, Advocates are the "The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

Advocates' Friendships

perfect type to nudge Analyst friends toward compassion and tact,
speaking the same insightful language but having greater emotional
understanding. When Analysts learn the value of expanding their
emotional intelligence, this friendship can really blossom. The "What
If" Machine Capture their imaginations with just the right topic, and
Advocates and their Analyst friends are in their element: They both like
juggling hypotheticals and challenging the status quo. Asking "What
if...?" is an adventure for both types, and they won't run out of fresh
material for a long time. Their unique priorities in life lead these
friends to inspire and challenge each other in very pleasant ways, and
any minor topic can grow into a full-fledged undertaking of thought. For
these friends, any conversation that exercises the imagination and opens
their worlds to exciting prospects can be extremely satisfying. With
visions that are different yet similarly resolute, Advocates and
Analysts complement each other, inspiring new thought and expanding each
other's curiosity. When they are balanced and open to new views, these
friends can open each other's eyes to the world around them. Productive
Cooperation Advocates and their Analyst friends can also have a lot of
fun if they decide to develop any of their ideas into reality. Both love
to explore ideas, but they may not always be able to act independently
on them. For Advocates, passionate ideals alone are very fulfilling;
they can imagine grand outcomes but not necessarily the mechanics to get
there. Analysts, on the other hand, often conceive intricate mechanics
instead of taking simple, realistic steps.

Advocates' Friendships

When they're willing to work together rather than claim the superiority
of their own style, they can unleash the combined force of their
imaginations. Few things are more fun than a friend who helps personal
dreams become reality. This mutual enjoyment gives both parties the
motivation to invest real effort in their ideas, rather than just
chatting about them.

Unbalanced Advocate--Analyst Friendships Conflicts of Nature Advocates
and Analysts may have occasional tension in their friendships,
especially if they aren't comfortable enough with themselves to be able
to accept others as they are -- a matter of personal growth. This
tension can arise from the different filters they tend to use to make
decisions: emotional humanism versus detached rationalism. It's all too
easy for these friends to forget just how differently they think at
times. If forthright individuals feel strongly about an issue, they can
easily upset each other. Advocates are sensitive to criticism and
tension, and Analysts are often gleefully provocative. When Analysts
forget their Advocate friends' feelings, their behavior can become an
unbalanced type of debate that can seem more like an attack. When
Advocates forget that ideological arguments are akin to an intellectual
game to Analysts, they may overreact with raw emotion, viciously
decrying them instead of playing along. Although their emotions may not
be as near the surface, Analysts nonetheless feel such accusations very
deeply when they come from a friend.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

112

Advocates' Friendships

Solutions Instead of Compassion These friendships can also experience a
more personal gap in emotional expression, as Analysts are rarely
comfortable or experienced with others' emotions, or even their own.
It's not that they don't have strong feelings, they just aren't very
perceptive, articulate, or enthusiastic when it comes to sharing them.
When Analysts fail to invest enough effort into being sensitive,
Advocate friends who don't understand the underlying disconnect may
react with overblown resentment, taking Analysts' distance as apathy
about the friendship, and they may dismiss them accordingly. Similarly,
in personal situations where Advocates expect compassion, Analysts often
disappoint, offering clever examination and solutions rather than a
gentle ear. Advocates often fail to understand the reasons behind
Analysts' clumsiness and tend to withdraw when they feel abandoned,
ironically blaming that abandonment on a friend who never committed such
an act. This can cause the two to lose faith in each other. Without some
conscious effort to understand their very different responses in the
face of personal need and emotional trouble, these friends can't give
each other their best support.

Rebalancing Advocate--Analyst Friendships Keeping an Open Mind The
primary problems in Advocate--Analyst friendships usually involve the
clash between the more humanistic Feeling trait versus the more detached
Thinking trait. Rebalancing comes from making a concerted effort to
understand each other: Advocates and Analysts may not speak the same
interpersonal language, but they do share deep perspectives and
insightful minds, and both are well-equipped to develop the
understanding needed to overcome their differences. Sharing their ideas
and

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

113

Advocates' Friendships

points of view comes naturally to them, and such conversations are
usually welcomed by both. The key is patient listening, as well as
considering each other's approaches (even if only out of respect).
Advocates and Analysts can also "agree to disagree" on some things. That
doesn't mean they need to squelch discussions or disagreements. However,
when they hit a point of unpleasant contention, they can simply back
off, reminding themselves to simply observe non-judgmentally. Being a
curious, interested observer fits both personality types, and the
approach can help prevent natural differences from becoming problematic.
Some helpful practices these two can employ: •

Listen to each other quietly with respect.

•

Verbally affirm the value of each other's opinions, regardless of
agreement.

•

Ask questions about how each other's different views are implemented in
daily life.

•

Recognize that different approaches are appropriate for different
people.

These friends can also bend their formidable imaginations to find
mutually satisfying solutions. Both types are well-versed in
hypothetical thinking, and when Advocates and Analysts use their
different approaches to create ideas that appeal to both, they can
generate days of conversation and entertainment, and maybe even
something actionable. Caring about Each Other's Needs If Advocates want
to rely on Analysts for emotional support, they can gently encourage
these friends to develop suitable skills. Although they should be
careful

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

114

Advocates' Friendships

not to indict Analysts as inadequate, there's nothing wrong with asking
a friend for help -- and helping them understand what's needed. Analysts
value their true friends and enjoy expanding their abilities. Advocates
can help them understand that, far beyond the logic of something being
"right" or "wrong," there's the simple truth of how friends make each
other feel through their behavior. It's very important for Advocates to
be up front, literal, and vocal about their needs; that's how Analysts
are, and it speaks to them. Whether asking Analysts to be less harsh in
their arguments, more open with their feelings, or sympathetic in times
of need, Advocates are usually impressed at how quickly Analysts learn
when motivated by friendship. Analysts are very capable of emotional
evolution, especially when Advocates serve as excellent examples. And of
course, when either friend tries to understand the other, positive
feedback is always appropriate, such as "I really appreciate the way you
try to see my perspective." Both friends can use the following tips: •

Deliberately make emotional needs known in plain language.

•

Be specific about the support needed: ideas, sympathetic listening, or
reassurance.

•

Ask questions about each other's feelings -- don't assume anything.

•

Give feedback on each other's support, showing an appreciative attitude.

Advocates can also keep in mind that Analysts have every right to make
requests in return; they may need a break from emotional connectedness.
The friends can dive into a common interest or recreation together,
dialing down the seriousness to perhaps share some humorous observations
about the world around them.

Advocate--Diplomat Friendships

For Advocates, close Diplomat friends mirror the best aspects of their
own personality. They're perfectly happy enjoying each other's company
for hours, and they aren't likely to run out of things to say. Because
Diplomats are relatively rare in the constellation of personality types,
these friends try hard to maintain such precious friendships regardless
of any difficulties. When they see how much they have in common, they
work to preserve their friendships and create lifelong bonds.

Balanced Advocate--Diplomat Friendships A Mental and Emotional Extension
Advocates and Diplomats share experiences with and through each other,
gaining the benefit and wisdom of each other's triumphs and trials.
Friends of these types will often say to each other something to the
effect of, "I had the most amazing idea the other day."
Advocate--Diplomat friends push and pull each other through life with
energy and compassion. It's almost as if their honest, in-depth
communication offers them a chance to live two lives at once.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

116

Advocates' Friendships

This deep knowledge of their friends' uniqueness, combined with their
caring nature, makes them each other's ideal confidants, nurses, and
emotional resources. Each knows what the other needs and when they need
it. Sometimes they offer comfort and sympathy, sometimes encouragement.
Other times, they may provide pointed feedback and gentle nudges. These
friends are inexhaustible wellsprings of emotional support. A Creative
Bond When Advocates and their Diplomat friends have a mutual interest,
they inspire each other, sharing core similarities that drive both in
similar directions. This doesn't necessarily mean the same direction --
they are, after all, individuals. But by weaving together harmonious yet
unique paths, Advocates and Diplomats glimpse things through each
other's different points of view. Such coordinated efforts can be real
gifts. Advocates and their Diplomat friends stir up profound feelings
and ideas in each other. When it comes to pursuing creative expression
and ideas together, Advocates find that other Diplomats make willing and
helpful partners. Even when the setting is relaxed, Diplomats explore
life and hold all its pieces in their minds, sharing what they see. When
these two types are together as trusting friends, their pleasure arises
from exchanging insights and dreams. And when they carry that over into
action together, their friendship reaches a whole new level.

Advocates' Friendships

Unbalanced Advocate--Diplomat Friendships Isolated and Insulated One key
challenge for Advocates and their Diplomat friends comes from the same
source that fuels their friendships -- their similarity. Having friends
who think likewise can be very reassuring and inspiring, but when these
friends agree too readily and uncritically, it can isolate them from
useful or cautionary input. They may convince each other that their
ideas are worth pursuing -- maybe even the only ideas worth pursuing --
even when that's simply not the case. When these friends fall into this
unhealthy pattern, they may also build walls to shield each other from
the outside world's sometimes unpleasantly harsh criticism, particularly
if they're both Introverted, losing diversity of thought in the process.
These friends' mutual reassurances risk creating shared delusions by
preventing the grounding benefits of fresh outside perspectives. By
firmly, even nobly, defending and supporting one another, Advocates and
their Diplomat friends can unintentionally perpetuate each other's
ignorance. Emotional Transfer Similarity may also lead Advocates and
their Diplomat friends to unconsciously manipulate each other. They
aren't likely to try to pull the wool over each other's eyes -- their
compassion and quest to be genuine go against such impulses. However,
that very compassion and desire to make others feel better about
themselves can lead to unbalanced bias. Both types project their
feelings onto others readily, and if they lose their objectivity, they
may confuse their own opinions for their friends' best interests. When
this happens, criticism or advice becomes more about what they want than

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

118

Advocates' Friendships

about what is right for those receiving it, and the high level of
emotional connection between these friends makes it hard to be
objective. Advocates and Diplomats are also natural compromisers when it
comes to the emotional states of friends; thus, they can be more
susceptible than most to this kind of influence. If a friend is upset or
negative, it's contagious. Rather than confront their friends, these
types may go along to get along, which can perpetuate unbalanced
behavior. The way they share emotions is one of the most beautiful
features of Advocate--Diplomat friendships, but emotional independence
is a skill worth developing. This again ties back to the importance of
personal growth as an underpinning factor of healthy relationships.
Floating in Space Advocates and their Diplomat friends place lots of
importance on imagination and dreams, but when they begin to exclude
what the real world offers, they miss out on important opportunities.
It's not a balanced approach to life to pay little attention to
practical, down-to-earth matters and pursuits. This can especially
create a challenge for friends who have closely entwined lives, for
example working together or sharing an apartment. There's nothing wrong
with flitting like butterflies from one lighthearted pursuit to another,
or from sharing deep introspective thoughts together about how things
could be -- this is a wonderful part of such friendships. However,
Advocate--Diplomat friends should be careful not to become lost in a
sort of divine chaos that feels exciting at first but becomes a
disconnection from reality -- with very real consequences. When friends
forget how much joy can be found in engaging in

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

119

Advocates' Friendships

earthly matters together, the relationship can become unbalanced. Dreams
can be beautiful, but shared experiences in the moment are no less so,
with the right friend.

Rebalancing Advocate--Diplomat Friendships Broadening Their Circles
Advocates and other Diplomats should sometimes break out of their
cloisters and ask, "What if ...?" out in the wider world. This may mean
joining larger groups with more diverse ideas, from book clubs to
community college classes, or finding some other way to break out of the
bubbles they may inadvertently create together. This may be difficult,
particularly for Advocates, because of their Introverted trait and how
much they value their friendships. They may not want to dilute their
connection to a specific person by including other people. However,
including others can be invaluable in rebalancing their most special
friendships. All Diplomats, including Advocates, crave authenticity, so
if they catch but a glimpse of worthy qualities outside their immediate
social circle, they explore and ultimately embrace those people.
However, they need that glimpse first, so they must consider the
possibility that someone with whom they didn't initially feel
commonality may have something of value to offer through friendship
after all. If these friends notice that their strong mutual support
prevents them from seeing potential value in others, they have little
choice but to seek balance together by widening their social scope. They
can use the following steps: •

Agree together to broaden each other's social limits.

•

Keep an eye out for different, interesting people.

•

Make their acquaintance and engage them socially.

•

Discuss together anything learned from others' unfamiliar perspectives.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

120

Advocates' Friendships

•

Maintain the privacy of your own friendship, but try to include others
now and then.

When both friends work together to engage new people who might challenge
them, they can comfort and reassure each other, not to affirm their
limits, but to support each other in expanding them. Who knows what fun
new friends might bring? Exercising Independent Thought Advocates and
their Diplomat friends can rebalance subtle manipulations by focusing on
sharing their own feelings, thoughts, and ideas. These friends carry a
certain gravity with each other because of the trust inherent in the
relationship, but there is a difference between subtle pressure and
honest, gentle sharing. That is a difference Advocates may want to
fine-tune, especially among Diplomat friends, where emotions abound and
harmony is prized over all else. Advocate--Diplomat friends likely don't
want to reject each other's criticisms or concerns when they come from a
good place, but they should acknowledge that manipulation can also take
this form; that realization may make them aware of when it happens. The
word "manipulation" may sound harsh or unlikely, but it's important to
understand that we're talking about unconscious prejudice, not
deliberate machinations. In fact, conscious manipulation is a betrayal
of trust that these sensitive friends find repugnant; therein is the key
to rebalancing. Because these friends care so genuinely for each other's
well-being, merely mentioning the appearance of any unfair pressure will
hit home and likely halt it. When one of these friends takes the time to
gently express their concerns, the other will quickly look at their own
behavior anew, then do whatever it takes to restore balance. It's
helpful for these friends to keep these ideas in mind:

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

121

Advocates' Friendships

•

Express criticism as constructive concern, openly and without emotional
pressure.

•

Don't be afraid to respectfully consider but reject each other's advice.

•

Make appreciation clear to each other while staying firmly on a personal
path.

•

Try not to get too caught up in each other's emotions -- a little
distance can enable better objectivity and, ultimately, better care for
each other.

These friends want to be supportive, not controlling. It's enough to
honestly make their opinions known and offer their help to each other --
they don't need to feel responsible for each other's decisions, nor take
each other's independence as rejection. Instead of trying to push each
other subtly, they can give their support to the directions they each
choose for themselves. Rediscovering the Tangible Balancing their inner,
imaginative life with some real-world experiences is a huge benefit to
Advocates and their Diplomat friends. Instead of encouraging each other
to only live internally, these types can make it a point to get out and
experience the world. Such an effort at balancing their lives -- with
local fairs, the arts, or live music -- can only make their friendships
richer. Instead of watching and discussing a film (though there's
nothing wrong with that), perhaps a few frames of bowling or a
spontaneous hike would expand their lives. A little interaction with the
material world wouldn't hurt these pairs, who otherwise live through
imagination. This applies not just to matters of fun and fancy, but also
to daily responsibility. In each other's happy company, boring tasks and
routine life maintenance can be pleasant experiences. By supporting each
other's focus on things that matter -- but perhaps aren't the most
exciting -- these friends can affirm the deep care they have

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

122

Advocates' Friendships

for each other. Whether that means running errands together, offering
moral support to boost energy, or even pitching in on a few chores now
and then, Advocates and Diplomats can help keep each other on track.
When matters of daily life are under control, both types can gain the
freedom to move on to loftier pursuits they enjoy together. Here's a
little guidance: •

Make time to do basic, grounded things together, every week.

•

Focus on things that both enjoy that require attendance or
participation.

•

Try and pick things that exercise basic skills in a hands-on way, such
as painting or tennis.

•

Consider keeping each other company or even helping with chores and
errands -- make responsibilities fun by doing them together.

Regardless of any potential hiccups, these friends' shared interests,
imaginations, and tendency to seek win-win situations make them kind and
inspiring companions -- and they're also equipped with the compassion to
resolve conflicts should they arise.

Advocate--Sentinel Friendships

Sentinels are loyal and down-to-earth friends who are always eager to
advise and support. Their style is far more grounded and matter-of-fact
than Advocates', and they seek dedicated and sincere friendships based
on trust and stability. Sentinels' dependability comes with a degree of
rigid conventionality, however, so Advocates may dismiss Sentinel
friends as unimaginative or lacking creativity. That makes for an
incomplete assessment, though, as each type is creative in different
ways -- ways that can balance each other wonderfully.

Balanced Advocate--Sentinel Friendships Different Kinds of Creativity
Advocates' perceptive imaginations can seem like magic to Sentinel
friends, opening them to fun possibilities they wouldn't see on their
own. When it comes to inviting new experiences into this friendship,
Advocates tend to lead, although they are unlikely to push Sentinels
into anything too wild.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

124

Advocates' Friendships

Sentinels' creativity is fueled by the question, "How can we make this
happen?" Sentinels can perform logistical miracles that amaze their
Advocate friends. Although they may not always dream as big as their
Advocate friends, they often enact more of their ideas because they so
easily see how to make them happen. Truly, this friendship can be a
match made in heaven when these types collaborate. The Dreamer and the
Doer Advocates are known for focusing much of their energy on thought,
spending their free time on grand ideas, if not always action. Sentinels
are doers, naturally seeing clear steps to make things happen. Sentinels
understand the concept of responsible, fulfilling daily living more than
any other Role, and they can help their Advocate friends balance their
cerebral passions with practicality to create workable progress that's
sensible as well as idealistic. Because of their focus on the future,
Advocates invite judicious change as a matter of course, something that
astounds Sentinels, who tend to resist change in favor of personal
traditions. Advocates can help their Sentinel friends see the benefits
of occasionally letting go of rigid concerns and engaging in the
exploration of possibilities, creating a balance between security and
necessary progress. Sentinel friends find inspiration in the original
ideas that come so naturally to Advocates, driving them to expand the
scope and scale of their life goals. In balance together, these friends
have meaningful, fun adventures, as well as satisfying shared
accomplishments. Solace Advocates can drown in worries when negative
emotions take over, but Sentinels' steady footing and realistic
composure can help them overcome personal chaos

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

125

Advocates' Friendships

arising from darker imaginings. When Sentinel friends say, "We'll get
through this," they mean it, and Advocates feel the truth of their
support -- it's not just a reassurance or the tendering of hope, it's a
promise. Sentinel friends freely give their resolve and their certainty
that they will find a solution or, at least, a more earth-bound
perspective. Of course, Sentinels, in turn, find that the deep and
sincere care of Advocates is touching far beyond what reason might
dictate. There can be something powerfully reassuring about a friend who
looks past earthly matters and practical perspectives into the soul
itself, giving pure empathy and care regardless of circumstance.
Sentinels can release their worldly troubles and simply appreciate the
warm, enveloping concern of Advocate friends like a soft blanket around
them.

Unbalanced Advocate--Sentinel Friendships What Is Fun? When Advocates
meet with their Sentinel friends, they're likely hoping to bond and
share profound, timeless insights mulled since their last encounter.
Sentinels, on the other hand, may be looking forward to an afternoon
hanging out, catching up, and engaging in favorite established pastimes
together. Both types want to enjoy each other's company, but how they
prefer to spend shared time can be profoundly different. Without fuller
understanding of each other's views of what is important -- or what
counts as fun -- they might have misunderstandings or unbalanced
feelings of annoyance. Advocates will want to spend their time together
exploring esoteric topics and possibilities together in conversation,
perhaps in a café. They'll want to talk about what they've been up to
recently, as well as their ideas and plans -- things that exist

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

126

Advocates' Friendships

inside their bright mental landscape. For Sentinels, however, such
discussions serve only as a reference point for the reality of the
moment, and they'll likely be more interested in talking about -- and
actively engaging -- whatever is right in front of the pair. For them, a
café is not just a place to share each other's thoughts, opinions, and
hopes, it's also a place to enjoy good food and drinks together, perhaps
people watch. When Advocates lose sight of the fun present in the
moment, they may leave their Sentinel friends behind. Concepts
vs. Execution These friends can balance each other's lives, but if they
criticize each other's methods, the unbalanced behavior can lead to
conflict and tension. Both types tend to have fixed ideas of what they
want to achieve, but they may go about it in very different ways.
Advocates organize their worlds around concepts and visions of greater
hopes and ideas, whereas Sentinels organize their worlds around details
and stability. This can become an issue when they try to work together
toward a common goal, such as a social endeavor or shared outing.
Advocates' focus on the intangible becomes unbalanced when it leads to
indifference or irresponsibility, such as the details of executing
mutual activities. They may act based on unrealistic expectation more
than sensible assessment, causing plans to falter or go awry in ways
that frustrate Sentinels, who think they can see how problems could have
been avoided. Sentinels, on the other hand, might insist too rigidly on
details, hanging their own -- and others' -- happiness on procedural
matters instead of a broader outcome of fun and enjoyment. Although
neither intends to be intolerant of the other's style, it can turn out
that way when these friends make plans together.

Rebalancing Advocate--Sentinel Friendships Appreciating Fundamental
Differences For these types, having fun together requires understanding
that they may have different definitions of fun. One of the first steps
to closing the gap between Advocates' conceptual focus and Sentinels'
fixed, pragmatic view is simply to acknowledge that difference. Although
there may never be a full meeting of the minds, there can be a meeting
of the hearts and a sense of acceptance and mutual respect. With
patience, each can work to understand that the other is coming from a
good place, which creates common ground for enjoying each other's
company. It's a fool's errand to ask Advocates to be less passionate or
Sentinels to relax their need to maintain practical control. However,
the best way forward is to take a step into each other's worlds, at
least a little -- they needn't lose who they are or cease
counter-balancing each other. Sentinels can still ask their Advocate
friends to take a deep breath when they are too distracted with new
ideas or passions, and Advocates can still ask their Sentinel friends to
lighten up a bit when they're obsessed with serious responsibilities.
The mere intent to accept and explore each other's ways a little at a
time will be enough to rebalance this caring friendship. Both friends
can do the following: •

Respect each other's differences. Apply what you know about what your
friend prefers or dislikes.

•

Ask questions about how each other's differences are applied in daily
life. Try to get a glimpse of each other's point of view.

•

Make time to do things together that appeal mainly to one friend, then
alternate fairly.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

128

Advocates' Friendships

These two will likely always have to make room for the other's style.
However, if they believe that their own approach is just fine for
themselves, then they must give their friends the respect and space to
do things their way -- treating others as they wish to be treated.
Understanding Is Caring Advocates should recognize that it is no small
matter to disrupt a Sentinel's best-laid plans. Sentinels take their
responsibilities seriously, and even seemingly minor disruptions of
their code can lead to hurt feelings. Advocates can rebalance such
missteps, both by letting their compassion open the door to compromise,
and by taking time to appreciate what Sentinels contribute to shared
plans. It's great to have a grand concept for a fun shared activity, and
a good plan well-executed ensures that concept becomes reality.
Recognizing the value of Sentinels' realistic logistics not only
demonstrates respect, it also helps Advocates learn a skill that will
help them accomplish their enthusiastic hopes. For their part, Sentinels
should try not to control every little detail; making something happen
in a successful and fun way doesn't require absolute predictability.
Sentinels are unlikely to be carried away by abstract concepts or
stretched profundity, but they can open themselves enough to enjoy an
unrestrained moment. They can rebalance over-rigidity by realizing that
tight control of an endeavor sometimes severely limits its potential --
that Advocates' seemingly "unrealistic" hopes may be the first step
toward unexpected, amazing experiences together. Some tips to help these
friends rebalance their differing ideas of how to have fun: •

Participate in activities that matter to each other.

•

An activity doesn't have to be engaging to enjoy the company of friends.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

129

Advocates' Friendships

•

Try to respect the specificity of friends' needs. You don't always need
to know "why."

•

Ask your friend how you can support them so they have fun with you.

Ultimately, friends are friends. Even though Advocates and Sentinels are
sometimes caught off-guard by the different ways they approach
activities, they can have even more fun together when they focus on each
other's unique contributions.

Advocate--Explorer Friendships

When both types behave in balanced, understanding ways toward each
other, Advocate--Explorer friendships can easily epitomize "opposites
attract." With a little effort, this friendship can be very fulfilling
for both types, even as others wonder how these oddly matched friends
make it work. Such friendships require a lot of mutual understanding. If
Advocates and their Explorer friends are dedicated and flexible enough,
and share a few mutual interests, though, their friendships will be
anything but boring.

Advocates' Friendships

Balanced Advocate--Explorer Friendships This might be one of the more
exciting combinations of personality types, with interesting
opportunities for both. Explorers are more adaptable than idealistic,
pragmatically in tune with the everyday world instead of the fantastic
goals that are so central to Advocates' worldview. Advocates' initial
impressions of potential Explorer friends are likely to be concentrated
on the latter's spontaneity, unpredictability, and focus on engaging the
present moment. This can intrigue Advocates, who may see Explorers as
doorways to enlightening, interesting experiences. Yin and Yang Balance
Advocates and Explorers have a few particularly notable differences
which, in a good friendship, can benefit both. Although Advocates love
to have fun, they can be so serious-minded as to disconnect from
immediate reality -- moralistic ideas and visions of the future often
dominate their thinking. Explorer friends offer a healthy distraction
that helps bring Advocates out of their heads and into the moment. The
self-gratifying immediacy of Explorers' typical pursuits offers a
satisfying and healthy break for Advocates caught up in their
ruminations and existential stress. Meanwhile, Advocates offer some
useful ideological structure for their more spontaneous Explorer
friends. Advocates love to share their contemplative and compassionate
view of life with others. For novelty-seeking Explorers, being inspired
to explore the deeper meaning in everything can stimulate their sense of
adventure. This is especially true if it involves working directly on
something tangible together. Explorers can find great satisfaction in
doing something that applies their skills in a new way, guided by an
imaginative Advocate friend.

Unbalanced Advocate--Explorer Friendships Different Levels of Interest
These two have the potential to balance each other through their
differences, but they may also clash. They tend to have very different
lifestyles: Advocates try to live for intangible values born from their
imaginations and beliefs, whereas Explorers connect to the world around
them by engaging in practices rather than ruminations. When either takes
their own perspective too far, they can easily alarm each other by
unfairly criticizing their differences. When this happens, Advocates are
quick to judge how Explorers should feel about things, especially in
conceptual and social areas. They may think their Explorer friends are
being selfish by focusing on accomplishing their own, more tangible
interests instead of sharing broader societal concerns. In turn,
Explorers may get annoyed at Advocate friends for expressing high-minded
opinions yet failing to follow through with any realistic ideas or
practical actions. Explorers put great focus on personal accomplishment
and have little respect for what they may see as endless talk. This
isn't nearly so simple as a case of altruism versus selfishness, though.
Explorers often maintain a "live and let live" attitude, which at its
core is highly respectful of others. Advocates pour their energy into
their ideas for positive change, but that drive can easily become
sanctimonious or controlling. The issue here isn't that one of these
friends has an inferior approach, but rather that they can fail to
respect how well their differing approaches work. When in sync, these
two balance each other wonderfully, but if they allow their perspectives
to become unbalanced, their differences make for a slippery slope into
judgment and resentment.

Advocates' Friendships

Mutual Disdain for the Mundane Fun Explorers may pull Advocates out of
the clouds, but even with the best of intentions, these two might step
into an irresponsible dynamic. Explorer friends are likely to encourage
Advocates to set aside some of life's obligations, whether blowing off a
homework assignment or loosening a budget for a night out. For their
part, Advocates easily get caught up in shared moments of joy with
friends, happily ignoring rational concerns in favor of feeling good.
When things go too far out of balance, they enable each other to
disregard consequences. This may play out differently in friendships
than with roommates, families, or spouses. Nonetheless, friends can be
an unbalancing influence on each other when they become a refuge from
reality. Although Advocates tend to maintain firm priorities, their
priorities can easily become unrealistic, and too much fun indulgence
with spontaneous Explorers only makes matters worse. Being supportive of
each other can do unintentional harm when these friends don't
discriminate what they support; inspiring shared experiences can enrich
the soul while leaving bank accounts dangerously impoverished. The
Tortoise and the Hare As much as Advocates can enjoy sharing experiences
with Explorers, they may be in for some disappointment as well.
Explorers seize interests with passion, but they may just as easily drop
them. It's not that Explorers can't maintain commitment if something
fascinates them -- they are at their best when they strive to master a
craft -- but if the passion dies down, it's difficult for them to
maintain their energy. Advocates who have invested time and energy with
their Explorer friends in a mutual

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

133

Advocates' Friendships

pursuit may find this upsetting, and if they allow this perfectly
natural frustration to grow without resolution, conflict may result.
Advocates may see this as a matter of trust, something very important to
them. When they feel they cannot trust Explorer friends to be consistent
in shared pursuits, that insecurity can push Advocates into an
unbalanced overreaction. They may withdraw their time and energy
entirely because they just can't bear the unpredictable changes. In
turn, Explorers are baffled by what they see as slavery to constancy,
and they may grow resentful when Advocates reject their spontaneous
inspirations. Explorers who lose their sense of balanced patience may
view Advocates as stuck up or stuck in a rut and, either way, may
disdain their feelings and need for stability.

Rebalancing Advocate--Explorer Friendships Respecting Interests Good
friends often find interest in subjects they don't care about simply
because a friend cares so much. When it comes to their different
approaches to life, Advocates and Explorers may need to be willing not
only to overlook differences but also go along for the ride
occasionally. Friendship is participatory. If either type is rigid and
refuses to pay any attention to the things that excite the other, the
relationship won't have much of a foundation. Of course, in addition to
adapting to each other's needs, Advocates and Explorers can have great
friendships while maintaining separate interests, too. In fact, they
probably should. Friends of Explorers must appreciate their need to do
their own thing. Advocates also have their preferences, and they may
need to pursue certain things without the company of Explorers. On some
level, such friendships may require sufficient distance and flexibility
to allow the individuals room to be

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

134

Advocates' Friendships

themselves. True friends don't need to share everything; they can give
each other space, and then come together to make plans that are
rewarding to both. These steps can help keep both friends satisfied: •

Try to understand each other by discussing differences.

•

Allow each other's differences without judgment.

•

When friction occurs, take time apart to engage individual interests.

•

Come back together often for things that both friends enjoy.

For an Advocate--Explorer friendship to ultimately work, both types
should have enough in common that they enjoy, rather than simply
tolerate, the unique pursuits of the other person. Sometimes this may
require friends to take an unselfish step outside of their comfort zone
or area of interest, even as they hold on to the values and interests
that make them who they are. Looking out for the Little Things
Advocate--Explorer friends may both want to ignore their boring
responsibilities, but because they care for each other, they should
avoid becoming enablers and try to keep a caring, watchful eye on each
other's well-being. Mutual support is a great benefit of friendship,
even if friends share similar flaws. This can be as simple as each
friend taking a moment to ask themselves not only what would make their
friend happy, but what would serve them best in the long run. When
facing shared decisions about anything from life choices to recreational
plans, these friends can add a layer of respect for each other by
considering each other's welfare as well as pleasure. Advocates are
especially good at this and likewise deeply appreciate such efforts from
Explorer friends. These friends can absolutely

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

135

Advocates' Friendships

indulge in fun and excitement together -- they just need to make sure
their reach doesn't exceed their grasp. These friends can help each
other by employing these steps: •

Try not to distract each other from life responsibilities.

•

Keep each other's well-being in mind when planning things together.

•

Inquire about each other's availability based around consideration for
other priorities; "after you're finished doing \[blank\], want to hang
out?"

If these friends take time to observe what's going on in each other's
lives, they'll recognize when they can get together for fun and when
other priorities demand their attention. Prying each other away from
stress is great, as long as they recognize when to let each other focus
on important things. Accepting Non-Commitment Advocates should know that
Explorers may be uncomfortable committing to things -- not because they
can't follow through, but because they don't want joy to turn into
obligation. This may not make sense to Advocates, who value commitment.
Predictability never was the charm of this pairing, though, nor is it
needed for Advocates to feel appreciated. It's that sense of unexpected
inspiration that makes Explorer friends so valuable to Advocates seeking
personal balance. Explorers pull them into the moment, where they can
see the deeper dimensions of a subject or experience without distraction
from thoughts of the future or past. That said, Advocates can help
Explorer friends recognize that the difference between spontaneity and
jerking the carpet out from under them can be a matter of communication.
Advocates need consideration for their feelings, and frankly, a little

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

136

Advocates' Friendships

hand-holding goes a long way when leading Advocates into changes and the
unknown. Explorers can make it clear that although their interests and
direction may be subject to sudden change, their support will always be
there. Instead of turning away to follow their own path, they can offer
a friendly hand and the option to join; this helps Advocates feel valued
and respected whether they choose to participate or not. Advocates care
about their friends. To create balanced friendships with Explorers, they
can work to accept their unique qualities and needs: The stricter the
arrangement, the less likely Explorers are to be comfortable. Any
efforts to control or direct them -- something that Advocates may want
to do in reaction to Explorers' spontaneity -- are likely to push them
away. Advocates can moderate their desire for steadiness by appreciating
how Explorers' spontaneity can benefit them; such friends will be ready
to drop what they're doing and join them at a moment's notice. It's
important for both friends to: •

Be gently honest with each other when something isn't fun anymore.

•

Be understanding when one or the other wants a change.

•

Try to manage expectations internally and be flexible.

•

Ask for -- and give -- their best effort to stick with important things
together.

Early and frequent communication can help Advocates and Explorers manage
changing preferences while enjoying time together. There's no better
method than staying honest yet considerate toward each other. With a
little care, this friendship can be a lasting source of happiness.

Conclusion Advocates are known for their never-ending desire to put
things together in wonderful ways. This inclination takes on a new
dimension as Advocates incorporate the unique qualities and needs of
other personality types into their friendships. Advocates care deeply
about forging lasting, reliable relationships with those who share their
values and perspectives. When Advocates open themselves to understanding
and appreciating people with whom they may not share easy or immediate
compatibility, the friendships dovetail beautifully with personal
growth. Advocates' combination of traits makes them passionately
progressive but not always open-minded; they have deep values and a
tendency to want to change the world to suit their own views.
Friendships with people who don't completely share their perspective
might not provide obvious reassurance, but ultimately, they may create
even greater gains. If personal growth is about embracing change, then
it can't always be comfortable. Thus, surrounding themselves with
similar-minded people may not give Advocates the chance to achieve their
greatest growth. On the other hand, friendship shouldn't feel like a
class, always challenging the mind to expand. Everyone craves the
comfort of trustworthy friends with whom they can share their deepest
secrets -- people who will stick with them through thick and thin. It's
also critically important to have friends who are simply fun and
relaxing to be around. Fortunately for Advocates, personality types who
are very different can also provide these benefits. Regardless of
people's differing methods and perspectives, Advocates can almost always
find something to appreciate and admire about them. Advocates want to
see the best in people, and when they let this desire for connection
lead them into

unexpected friendships with diverse people, they find rewards that far
exceed their own assumptions.

Advocates as Parents

Like all Diplomat parents, Advocates focus intently on promoting
morality and ethical behavior in their children from a very young age.
They are very principled, driven, and compassionate, and they do their
best to ensure that their children can fight for causes they believe in,
as well as separate the good from the bad. This doesn't mean that
Advocate parents encourage their children to become fanatics, but they
do stress the importance of having a clear moral compass and noble
goals. Advocate parents also encourage their children to listen to their
emotions when making decisions and to be sensitive and kind whenever
possible. They believe that doing what's right is much more important
than merely doing what society or their peers expect them to do.
Advocate parents will be prouder if their children befriend a lonely
classmate than if they win the title of prom queen or king. Having their
children grow up as sensitive, principled individuals is one of the key
goals for parents with this personality type. When Advocates are
confident in themselves, they can trust their instincts and their
hearts, and they teach their children to do the same.

Imaginative and Creative Advocates who are in touch with their values
often place a lot of importance on imagination and creativity. Parents
with this personality type encourage their children to explore various
hobbies and personal interests, hoping they find inspiration to pursue
their own passions. They don't try to get their children to "follow the
crowd," instead attempting to embolden them to think independently. More
than anything, they want their children to be true to who they are,
regardless of what society says that they "should" be. Taking their own
advice, confident Advocates also take a creative approach to parenthood,
using their insight and imagination to approach issues that they, or
their children, may face. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the
many dilemmas that life will undoubtedly serve up, and Advocate parents
realize the necessity of being able to provide appropriate responses and
creative solutions. They excel at combining their empathy with ingenuity
to take unique, individually tailored problem-solving approaches to the
pickles that they and they children encounter. Dedicated and Empathic
Devotion to their ideals is a cornerstone for Advocates who have a
healthy grasp of their own identity, and this dedication easily
transfers to their approach to parenthood. Meeting their children's
needs, both emotionally and physically, is a soul-quenching endeavor for
these parents. Although some parents may feel drained by their
children's constant neediness, Advocates are invigorated by all
opportunities to bond with their children while providing them with the
love and support they need.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

141

Advocates as Parents

At their best, Advocates are very sensitive and empathic, especially
when it comes to their family members. As parents, they will help their
prepubescent child cover up their first pimple before school without
judgment, and they will be on hand with ice cream and a shoulder to cry
on when their teenager is rejected by their first big crush. Children
with Advocate parents are unlikely to find themselves lacking in
compassionate connections, especially when they are needed most.
Difficulty Detaching Advocates' empathy and compassion help them create
strong emotional bonds with their children, which may seem idyllic --
until it's time for their children to start making their own way in the
world. In some cases, the emotional bonds between parent and child can
be taken too far, becoming an unbalanced exaggeration of an otherwise
healthy affection. What initially appears to be a loving bond can spiral
into codependency, and Advocate parents may have difficulty accepting
that their children have become adults who need to lead independent
lives. Unbalanced Advocate parents may find themselves behaving like the
ignominious helicopter parents of suburban folklore who are overly
involved in every aspect of their children's lives. In their unceasing
desire to "do what's best" for their children, they commit unseemly acts
such as calling potential employers to encourage them to hire their son
or daughter or completing their child's science fair project for them,
using resources and abilities no second-grader would possess. With mom
or dad always taking care of their problems, such children can
eventually become entitled adults who fail to take responsibility for
their actions or behaviors.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

142

Advocates as Parents

Overly Sensitive Because of their sensitivity and focus on morality,
Advocates can be deeply offended by things that other personality types
would probably shrug off. Few things are more hurtful to Advocates who
over-identify with their beliefs than seeing their children challenge
or, in certain cases, fully reject them. In such circumstances,
Advocates may blame themselves for being unable to instill the right
values in their children, and they may try to fix that by resorting to
emotional manipulation. Parents with this personality type should be
especially careful during their children's adolescent years. Teenagers
often rebel against their parents' authority, and Advocates shouldn't
immediately assume that their kids are actively fighting their beliefs
or that all their teachings were ignored. Otherwise, Advocates may try
to focus all their efforts on mitigating damage and strengthening their
relationships with their children -- which may provoke even stronger
pushback. Lacking Follow-Through Advocates have infinite ideas, thanks
to their strong Intuitive trait; however, their pursuit of these ideas
can be hampered by impracticality and unrealistic expectations. Often a
result of inexperience and immaturity, their impracticality often
manifests as a lack of attention to detail, resulting in failure to
follow through with their plans. Advocate parents may have every
intention of sticking to a detailed grocery budget, but if they don't
determine what items they need to get from the store in advance, they
are likely to spend more than expected. Even when caught up in their
ideas and causes, Advocate parents aren't necessarily being
irresponsible. They just tend to shy away from details when they are
caught up in the more exciting aspects of a situation or when they are
focusing on the big

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

143

Advocates as Parents

picture. Their Judging trait generally promotes decisiveness and
structure; however, when they become exceptionally stressed, busy, or
distracted, those traits become compromised. Planning for a big protest
may take priority in their mind over cleaning the house or helping with
the school holiday party. Details can slip through the cracks when they
become consumed with more idealistic pursuits. Inspiring Independence As
much as they may believe they are helping their children by constantly
solving their problems, Advocate parents who do not allow their children
to struggle and learn from their mistakes are doing them a disservice.
Fortunately, the same passion they have for helping their children can
easily be transformed into a passion for promoting their growth and
development. Many Advocates consider themselves aficionados of personal
development, as they seek out and engage in growth opportunities
themselves. This drive to constantly improve and evolve is inspirational
and can be harnessed to help Advocate parents serve as mentors to their
children rather than the saviors they may aspire to be. The key to
inspiring healthy independence throughout children's lives is to provide
the proper balance of challenge and support. Advocate parents certainly
don't need to let their children wallow in confusion, but they shouldn't
be too quick to jump in and solve their problems either. Allowing
children to experience failure is just as important as supporting them
during their greatest trials. A child who "forgets" to study for a
history test must accept the consequences of their behavior (not paying
attention, being disorganized). Instead of swooping in to save them,
Advocate parents should help them to cope with the consequences and
learn from them.

Advocates as Parents

Improving Understanding of Self and Others One of the best ways to
counter a tendency to be overly sensitive is to improve understanding of
self and others. If Advocate parents are unaware of their own triggers
(what makes them feel insecure or offended), it's easy for them to get
carried away by any perceived slights. Likewise, if they fail to
understand that their children have their own unique values and
personality traits, they may assume that they are being defiant or
difficult. Despite the influence that Advocate parents have over their
children, it's important to respect and support their differences.
Children may not choose to be vegans like their Advocate parent, but
that doesn't mean they don't value life or love animals any less. One of
the rewards of parenthood is the opportunity to learn from children and
grow as human beings. Sometimes parenting brings out the negative side
-- like yelling at the toddler who threw their cup on the floor again --
but it also brings out the best and most authentic parts of a person's
personality. Advocate parents are especially selfless, and their
self-sacrifice and compassion will not go unnoticed, even though it
might be taken for granted for some time. Reflecting on the aspects of
parenthood that are especially hard, like dealing with rebellious
teenagers, will allow Advocates to see what aspects of themselves they
need to improve or balance. Rebellious teens hate it when their Advocate
parents "lecture" them about their choices, and Advocates can learn that
subtle statements about their opinions may resonate more than
full-fledged diatribes. After all, Advocates are most inspirational in
their actions; if they model the values they hold dear, their children
will likely respect and adopt those values as well.

Embracing a Daily Rhythm Difficulty with details and follow-through is a
struggle for many Advocate parents. However, Advocates can deal with
these issues in ways that allow for the flexibility they desire -- while
still promoting the structure necessary to participate in their passions
and get the kids to soccer practice on time. The best way for Advocates
to achieve balance between structure and flexibility at home is to
incorporate a structured rhythm in their daily lives. Creative Advocates
may balk at the idea of structure, equating that word with boredom and
conformity; however, they will quickly appreciate the order and
simplicity that a daily rhythm provides. Besides reducing stress and
chaos, routines have the added benefit of providing stability for
children, decreasing the likelihood of tantrums and other difficult
behaviors. Additionally, when used correctly, structure allows for more
freedom to pursue creativity and connections with their children. Now
that we have discussed some of the potential strengths and weaknesses of
Advocate parents, we will consider how those strengths and weaknesses
impact their parenting during different developmental stages.

Parenting for Each Stage of Development Each stage of a child's growth
presents both unique challenges and exciting milestones. Learning how to
navigate these stages can seem daunting, but the opportunity to build a
healthy attachment and create meaningful memories is worth the struggle.
Renowned psychologist Erik Erikson proposed a theory of psychosocial
development that identified eight stages, five of which take place
between birth and 18 years of "The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

146

Advocates as Parents

age. (The ages listed for each stage are approximate.) Children develop
at their own pace and meet each milestone in their own time, sometimes
skipping stages, achieving them in an unexpected order, or trying one
milestone and then falling back to an old one -- the latter especially
common with walking. This is usually normal, but it's worth checking
with a pediatric physician regarding questions and concerns. The
following paragraphs discuss what to expect at each stage of
development, as well as how Advocates' strengths and weaknesses affect
their parenting at each stage.

Infancy (From Birth to Approximately 1½ Years) The first priority for
infants in the journey to attachment is having their basic needs met.
From being fed to receiving affection, infants either learn to trust
that their Advocate parents provide for them or suffer from a sense of
mistrust in all subsequent relationships. If parents are inconsistent or
neglectful in providing for their children, their infants will have
difficulty creating positive, trusting attachments with their parents.
On the other hand, attentive and affectionate parents, especially those
who engage in consistent physical contact such as snuggling or
transporting their children in a baby carrier on their body, will
develop trusting, hopeful relationships with their infants and are
likely to have very little difficulty building comfortable attachments.

Advocates as Parents

Balanced Parenting During Infancy Building Loving Bonds There are few
things in life as exciting as bringing home a new baby. Advocates, with
their deep desire to connect with others, find this stage particularly
satisfying. Advocates who tap into their empathy and sensitivity when a
child is born have no trouble giving their infants the attention and
affection needed to build a loving bond. Infants need affection that
goes beyond just daily care. They crave the physical connection that
their parents provide through cuddling, rocking, speaking softly, and
making eye contact. A parent's loving smile does more than just
entertain an infant, it creates a primal connection that inspires the
trust they need to create positive relationships. Building empathic,
emotional bonds with their children is Advocates' number one priority
throughout the lifespan, and the infancy stage is one of the most
rewarding times to interact with their children. Motivated Caretakers As
parents, Advocates thrive on feeling needed and enjoy being their
children's primary caretaker, which can motivate them during the
extraordinarily draining infant stage. Some parents may struggle to
maintain energy during this phase, thus experiencing mood swings or
other inconsistent behaviors, but Advocates' desire to feel needed
coupled with their reliability allows them to not only survive this
stage but even relish it. The moment their child is born, the first time
they smile, the first time they utter "mama" or "dada" -- these are all
meaningful and motivating experiences for Advocates. Advocate parents
live for these simple moments, from cuddling with their sleepy, satiated
baby in the rocking chair to making silly faces at them while changing

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

148

Advocates as Parents

their diapers. Few parents are as attuned to and appreciative of the
meaningful moments that build loving bonds with their children as
Advocates are.

Unbalanced Parenting During Infancy Taking on Too Much Many new parents
experience a great deal of pressure to maintain their pre-infant
lifestyle after a child is born. When Advocate parents become too
focused on living up to unrealistic expectations, they may find
themselves taking on more than they can handle. Both new Advocate
parents and veterans alike may attempt to play the role of "super
parent" by jumping back into work right away or obsessing about keeping
the house spotless. When Advocates cave into this pressure to appear
perfect, they end up over-taxing themselves physically, mentally,
spiritually, and emotionally. To further complicate matters, Advocates
hate to feel as though they are a burden to anyone -- they often feel it
is their role to be the helper. Asking for help, even when they truly
need it, can be extraordinarily difficult for Advocates. The infant and
toddler years are some of the most challenging for parents, and an
unwillingness to seek or accept help from others greatly increases the
possibility that Advocate parents will experience frustration,
exhaustion, and even depression. Struggling with Expectations In
addition to struggling with taking on too much, Advocates may have
unrealistic expectations of their children during this stage. They may
believe that their infants should achieve certain milestones more
quickly than is necessary or fret that their children aren't hitting
milestones "on time." Anxious Advocate parents may be more

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

149

Advocates as Parents

concerned about getting their children to sit up, roll over, feed
themselves, or walk before they are truly ready, rather than
appreciating their children's current abilities and engaging with them
at their level. Although it is certainly exciting to see a baby roll
over for the first time or sit up on their own, trying to push children
to achieve these milestones early only causes frustration for both
parties involved. Just because an infant isn't saying their first words
at the same time as another child doesn't mean that they are not on
track developmentally. Development, especially at this stage, is not a
measure of parental ability. Advocate parents and their infants will be
much happier and more relaxed if the babies are allowed to grow and
develop at their own pace.

Rebalancing Parenting During Infancy Seeking Support Learning to balance
their needs with their children's needs is one of the most important
things Advocates can do. To do so, Advocate parents should take time to
understand and accept their own limitations. It's not unreasonable to
request the maximum time off after the birth of a child or to let people
know you will only be stopping by the holiday meal this year. Being a
healthy parent is more important than being a "super parent," as well as
more realistic. Although Advocates tend to feel guilty, even
self-indulgent, when they put their own needs ahead of the needs of
others, they will find that doing so makes them happier, healthier
parents. Not everyone has the time, energy, or resources to take a
weekend retreat or get weekly massages, so the following suggestions are
effective ways for busy, burned-out Advocate parents to recharge in just
a few minutes:

•

Enjoy a 30-minute bath while your partner is putting the kids to bed.

•

•

•

Engage in a deep breathing exercise or yoga stretches for five minutes.

•

Find time to journal each day.

•

Talk to a friend or partner about your thoughts and feelings regularly.
Determining Developmental Needs

Developmental milestones are approximate -- not set in stone. Children
who attain certain milestones earlier are not necessarily "advanced,"
and those who achieve them later are not always "delayed." A child who
begins speaking at 9 months old may be hailed as brilliant, whereas a
sibling who doesn't speak until 13 months may be (incorrectly) assumed
to be "behind" in development. Labeling a child as advanced or delayed,
especially this early in life, can be detrimental to their development,
as well as their self-esteem, as labels often affect how others treat
them. Pediatricians and family physicians are parents' best resources
for determining whether they should be concerned about a child's
development. They can provide resources that cover what to expect at
different stages regarding physical, intellectual, psychological, and
behavioral development. Regular appointments with a physician ensure
that any issues are addressed as soon as possible, which can help to put
Advocate parents' minds at ease. Many resources are available to new
parents (and veteran parents who might want a refresher) to help improve
understanding of infant development, including: •

Books that discuss infant and child development in detail, such as: "The
WholeBrain Child" by Daniel J. Siegel, MD, and Tina Payne Bryson, PhD;
"What to

The Toddler Stage (From Approximately 1½ to 3 Years) Once they are
mobile, young children become very interested in exploring their
environment with their senses. Crawling, walking, grabbing items,
putting things in their mouths, and attempting verbal communication are
just a few of the ways toddlers learn about the world around them.
During this stage, Advocate parents must provide a safe harbor for their
children while still allowing them to experience and explore their
surroundings. Children who can test boundaries yet still receive
parental support and encouragement develop a sense of autonomy. Children
who are overly restricted, criticized, or made to feel guilty for their
desire to test boundaries ultimately experience a sense of shame and may
suffer from feelings of incompetence or low self-worth. These feelings
can last throughout their lives and may ultimately jeopardize their
ability to achieve goals and develop positive character traits, such as
reliability or confidence.

Balanced Parenting During the Toddler Stage Compassionate and Engaged
Extremely supportive, Advocates make an ideal "home base" for their
children during this stage. Their focus on meaningful engagement with
their children combined with a sincere determination to meet their needs
ensures that their children never feel abandoned, ignored, or unloved.
Even though children at this age seek independence, they still crave
(and need) a trustworthy caregiver, and Advocates do not disappoint.
Advocates' compassion, for themselves and others, is especially useful
during the trying toddler years. Although this stage can certainly be
challenging, confident Advocate parents enjoy promoting their children's
curiosity and independence while still maintaining a safe environment.
They take pleasure in helping their children learn how to pick out their
own clothes and dress themselves while also promoting their children's
natural creativity and self-expression. Helping their children learn to
become creative, self-reliant, and competent is among Advocate parents'
greatest joys. Providing Safe Boundaries Advocates excel at setting up
reasonable boundaries that allow their toddler children to feel as
though they are unrestricted but still allow some parental control.
Toddlers working to build a sense of autonomy need to have the
perception that they are allowed to play or explore freely. Something as
simple as setting up a space where a toddler can color, glue, and paint
without worrying about the mess or allowing them to pick out their own
books at the library can feel incredibly liberating to children at this
stage.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

153

Advocates as Parents

The toddler years are the first time when Advocate parents need to
develop their ability to determine what boundaries their children need
and how to successfully create them. Providing a safe yet inspiring
environment gives Advocates the sense of control they need to remain
confident. When set up properly, this structure can expand and contract
with a child's changing needs and abilities.

Unbalanced Parenting During the Toddler Stage Difficulty with Defiance
This stage can be especially challenging for Advocate parents if they
take a toddler's willful or defiant behavior personally. When the
children they have so lovingly raised begin using their newly acquired
favorite word (No!), parents can become frustrated and discouraged. From
throwing a fit every evening at bed time to refusing to eat any form of
fresh produce, toddlers often seem as though they are focused almost
exclusively on challenging what their parents have taught them. As much
as they truly want to foster their children's independence, Advocates
struggle when their children's behavior does not match their
expectations. The toddler stage is when identity development begins, and
children often behave in a way that does not fit their parents' personal
mold. Behaviors such as hitting their siblings or yelling at their
parents, which are normal during this stage although not desirable, can
be especially demoralizing to Advocates who feel that their children's
morals should be more developed at this point. When Advocate parents are
more focused on an idealized version of their children, they may miss
opportunities to promote and support the unique aspects of their
toddlers' personalities.

Overly Involved Advocates thrive on feeling needed and can become
completely focused on meeting their children's every need. In an attempt
to "help" their children, Advocates may inadvertently raise children who
struggle with poor self-regulation and a lack of initiative. Constant
interventions at the toddler stage can result in the expectation that
everything will be done for them, perhaps resulting in failure to take
responsibility for their own behaviors. Although unbalanced Advocate
parents may believe they are being compassionate and attentive, their
behaviors may stunt development. Forcing children of this age to engage
only in structured or educational games may seem like it will promote
learning, but it prevents them from learning how to generate their own
ideas or solve real-world problems. Similarly, stepping in every time
their children argue or fight will impede their social development
because they never learn how to resolve conflicts for themselves.
Despite their best intentions, overly involved Advocates run the risk of
limiting their toddlers' growth and their ability to deal with the
challenges they will face as they grow older.

Rebalancing Parenting During the Toddler Stage Modeling Respectful
Behavior As much as Advocates love to promote their children's growth,
it can be disheartening to watch formerly cuddly and relatively docile
infants turn into defiant, raging "No" machines. Parents may wonder
"What happened to that sweet baby?" But Advocate parents should remember
that the toddler stage is just that -- a stage. The wild mood swings and
forceful gestures of independence -- like screaming and

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

running through the grocery store when they don't get the cereal they
want -- eventually balance out, once they hit their school-aged years.
Advocate parents must understand that their children are in the process
of establishing autonomy and are not intentionally rejecting them. Much
like college students who party when they are supposed to be studying,
toddlers are pushing boundaries and finding their own way; they are not
focused on defying their parents, as much as it might seem. Just because
children are becoming more independent, however, doesn't mean that
parents should allow them to get away with demanding behavior. Advocate
parents should still redirect their children and model appropriate ways
to behave. Some ways to do that include: •

Teach toddlers to raise their hand or place their hand on a parent's arm
if they need to speak instead of interrupting. The parent will know the
toddler has something to say and will still get to finish their own
sentence.

•

Practice labeling emotions using pictures (smiley face, sad face, angry
face), and have the toddler point to the face that matches their
emotion. This should eventually help them feel understood and prevent
them from acting inappropriately on their emotions.

•

Read stories in which problems are solved via good behavior and
emotional control (such as the "Little Blue Truck," "Where the Wild
Things Are," and "The Runaway Bunny"). Focusing on Appropriate Growth

Advocate parents can prevent or undo any negative consequences of their
constant interventions with some of their own personal discipline and
development. The most

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

156

Advocates as Parents

effective way is to tap into their natural desire to encourage their
children, as well as their ability to inspire others to believe in their
cause. Advocate parents can encourage a toddler's development by
regularly looking for opportunities to promote growth and autonomy. The
focus should be on ageappropriate growth, skills, and abilities -- not
making sure they always do exactly what they're told, which isn't a
reasonable expectation at this age. The following actions will allow
Advocates to support their children while also inspiring independence: •

Let toddlers pick out what they want to wear (from two or three
options).

•

Have them try pouring their own cereal.

•

Allow them to wash their own hands and face after mealtime.

•

Make time for play with no agenda.

•

Encourage them to resolve conflicts through sharing and using kind words
(and resist the temptation to solve issues for them).

The Preschool Stage (From Approximately 3 to 5 Years) The preschool
years, from approximately 3 to 5 years of age, are a prime time for
brain development, and children at this stage accumulate knowledge at an
extraordinary rate. Children absorb information like sponges through
constant activity and a seemingly infinite stream of disparate
questions. Learning at this stage takes place through play, especially
the unstructured and imaginary kind, as well as lots of social
interaction with family and peers. Creativity is also exercised
extensively through make-believe games and stories.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

157

Advocates as Parents

To work through this stage effectively, children must have the
opportunity to make some of their own decisions, as well as be allowed
to initiate activities, ask questions, receive answers, and lead others
in exploratory play. Children without such opportunities, or who are
made to feel as though their constant questions or childish make-believe
games are annoying, will experience feelings of guilt, frustration, and
incompetence. Consequently, they may suffer from poor self-control, low
selfesteem, or a lack of initiative.

Balanced Parenting During the Preschool Stage Natural Teachers As
promoters of lifelong learning, Advocate parents genuinely look forward
to inspiring their children to enjoy learning as well. They happily
answer their preschool children's seemingly ceaseless streams of
questions and take great pleasure in finding creative ways to engage
their children in learning opportunities. From trips to the library to
impromptu nature lessons in the park, Advocates take any chance they can
to engage and educate their preschoolers. But educational opportunities
are not the only form of teaching that Advocate parents engage in --
modeling morals and values for their children from a young age is just
as important to them as any other form of learning. Advocate parents
teach their children to not only respect others but also appreciate
their differences as well. They insist on integrity, encouraging their
preschoolers to apologize to a neighbor whose flowers they dug up, then
helping them to understand why digging up the flowers was wrong in the
first place. Advocate parents feel they have a moral obligation to
instill their values through modeling and consistent reinforcement.

Emotionally Engaged Life with a preschooler isn't just about learning
and "teachable moments." Emotional engagement is Advocates' number one
priority -- both building strong bonds with their children and teaching
them how to develop their emotional intelligence. Children at this stage
are starting to learn the importance of self-control, empathy, and

interpersonal

relationships

(especially

with

peers),

and

they

need

compassionate guidance to properly develop such skills. Emotional
intelligence is best learned through modeling, and this is where
Advocate parents truly shine. Advocates who have developed their own
self-control and are able to engage in meaningful interactions can
lovingly communicate these concepts to their children. Imaginary play is
an especially useful outlet for practicing these skills. Something as
simple as playing a game of house can be a perfect opportunity for
Advocate parents to model healthy relationships and lovingly redirect
less-thandesirable behaviors. Not only do they pass on their emotional
wisdom, parents who engage in this type of play with their preschoolers
also enhance their emotional bonds as well.

Unbalanced Parenting During the Preschool Stage Pressure to be Perfect
The preschool years bring a new level of energy as children become more
interested in making sense of the world around them. Children at this
stage are more mobile and opinionated than ever, which can try parents'
patience. Parenting is an exhausting endeavor for even the most
energetic individuals, and this stage can be especially draining because
of constant questions and unceasing motion. As an Introverted and
especially private personality type, Advocates who don't take time to

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

159

Advocates as Parents

recharge regularly are likely to burn out, which can lead to exhaustion,
anxiety, and a short temper. Advocates who fall into the trap of
perfectionism are especially likely to become overwhelmed during this
stage. Just keeping up with work, chores, and the multiple needs of
everyone in a household can be exhausting. Life becomes even more
challenging when parents must also run their children from preschool to
play dates to swimming lessons to karate classes. Parents in today's
digital society may also feel burdened to make every birthday party and
family vacation worthy of posting on social media. Running around doing
errands and attempting to be the "perfect parent" can quickly take a
toll on Advocate parents, who would much prefer to focus on the
meaningful aspects of life over the marketable content. Overestimating
Abilities During the preschool years, children transition from
completely dependent infants to increasingly independent individuals. As
their preschoolers grow more competent and communicative, Advocate
parents risk overestimating their children's capabilities. Their desire
to one day view their children as equals can result in unrealistic
expectations that frustrate both parent and child. Specifically,
Advocates, as morally focused individuals, may assume that their
preschoolers can easily grasp any ideas or moral constructs they expose
them to, regardless of how complicated they may be. This is especially
true when the information they provide is hypothetical. Saying "You
shouldn't hit people. How would you feel if someone hit you?" seems like
a perfectly reasonable question -- but children at this stage are
incapable of putting themselves in another person's shoes. They may
respond with the requisite "I would feel bad," but what they are really

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

160

Advocates as Parents

thinking is "I would feel bad if someone hit me, but mostly I feel bad
because I got in trouble." Empathy and morality are still undeveloped at
this stage, and Advocate parents who expect their children to be
proficient in these skills will struggle to communicate effectively (and
appropriately) with their preschoolers.

Rebalancing Parenting During the Preschool Stage Adjusting Expectations
Rather than letting their perfectionism drive them to the brink of
burn-out, Advocate parents must learn to say "no" to the endless play
dates and activities and say "yes" to a much-needed break whenever
necessary. Children benefit more from healthy, happy parents than from
birthday parties with now-expected Internet-inspired homemade cakes,
pony rides, and goody bags worthy of the Oscars. Although Advocate
parents may initially feel some guilt for not "living up" to societal
(or their own perfectionistic) expectations, they ultimately will feel
liberated from the unnecessary obligations. Their natural tendency is to
live life based on their values, not societal expectations, so they must
find their way back to what is truly important to them and how they want
to raise their children. It's also important for Advocates to find ways
to take care of themselves while parenting. Some ideas for bringing
balance into the busy preschool stage include: •

Limit activities such as play dates, sports, art classes, etc., to just
a couple days a week rather than every other day.

•

Resist the temptation to make sure that every event or activity is
social-media worthy.

•

Schedule regular breaks -- parent date nights, drinks with friends, or
solo walks in nature -- anything that is recharging and refreshing.

•

Spend quality time with your preschooler with no agenda or expectations.
Accepting Age-Appropriate Abilities

The preschool stage is one of the most delightful stages, as
preschoolers can communicate with and understand their parents much more
effectively than they could in earlier years. Advocate parents who focus
on the progress that children have made are more successful in their
interactions than those who dwell on undeveloped skills. From silly
jokes to profound questions, preschoolers often display a type of genius
that is truly inspiring. Additionally, children at this stage have a
level of empathy that can make them sincerely compassionate. Advocate
parents who feel frustrated or overwhelmed by this stage have a
multitude of resources to better understand preschooler capabilities.
There is no shame in looking for help or asking for advice. Even
Advocates who aren't necessarily struggling with their preschoolers can
benefit from learning more about this stage. Some of the most useful
resources include: •

Family members or friends who have or have had preschool-aged children

•

Preschool teachers, daycare providers, and nannies

•

Pediatricians and child therapists

•

Books, websites, social-media groups, and blogs about parenting (use
discretion, of course)

The School-Age Stage (From Approximately 5 to 12 Years) The early school
years are an important period of skill development for young children.
Not only are they still constantly absorbing new information, but they
are also working on becoming proficient in increasingly complex
subjects, from relationships to mathematics to athletics. Children who
are both challenged and supported in these areas flourish in their
abilities as well as their self-confidence. If they do not receive
consistent support, children at this stage can begin to feel inferior to
their peers and will be less likely to develop long-term goals or work
toward achieving them. On the other hand, if they are not sufficiently
challenged, children in this stage can begin to feel overconfident,
potentially leading to a lack of modesty and compassion.

Balanced Parenting During the School-Age Stage Passionate and
Encouraging Often avid learners themselves, Advocates encourage their
children to pursue their academics with passion and curiosity. Despite
their love of learning, "traditional" educational environments do not
necessarily appeal to individuals of this type. Advocate parents may
find options like charter schools or homeschooling to be better choices
for educating their school-aged children. Ever the compassionate
parents, Advocates provide support and encouragement to children who are
struggling. At the same time, they don't let their compassion prevent
them from upholding their high expectations. Advocates' children are
expected to put effort into gaining knowledge and developing their
skills: Although

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

163

Advocates as Parents

they will certainly come to the aid of children who are struggling with
a certain class or the school bully, Advocate parents will also
encourage their children to work on finding solutions to such problems
themselves. Excellent Mentors The school years are a time of intense
learning, and Advocates are natural mentors who have no trouble modeling
the skills needed for academic success. Advocate parents do not shy away
from teaching their children the value of hard work and the importance
of traits such as innovation and creativity. Few types understand the
necessity of these traits the way Advocates do. At a stage in life when
children are constantly being told what to do and conforming to strict
schedules, innovation and creativity often become neglected or viewed as
unnecessary. Imaginative Advocate parents understand the importance of
these traits in an ever-changing world and encourage their children to
incorporate their unique ideas and perspectives into their academic and
personal lives. They encourage their children to integrate their
passions and causes into their lives as well -- from developing a
science project focused on global warming to organizing a student
council community volunteer day. Advocates are often extraordinarily
effective at inspiring and promoting passion in their children during
this stage.

Unbalanced Parenting During the School-Age Stage Struggling with
Confidence One of the most important skills for children to develop
during their school years is confidence. Everything from persisting on a
difficult school assignment to standing up for a friend who is being
teased, confidence is what gives children the strength to

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

164

Advocates as Parents

work hard and do the right thing. Advocate parents who may have lacked
support or encouragement during their own formative years are especially
likely to lack confidence in their own abilities. Struggling in a school
setting or being belittled by a domineering parent or teacher may come
back to haunt Advocates, preventing them from developing -- and
therefore modeling -- the confidence necessary to thrive. If they fail
to overcome this barrier themselves, Advocate parents run the risk of
raising children who shut down in the face of adversity. It does little
good for an Advocate to tell a child to "stand up for what they believe
in" and to "persevere when the going gets tough" if they fail to model
these behaviors in their own lives. Their children will not only
struggle with their own confidence, but also may see their
wellintentioned parents as hypocrites who fail to "walk the walk" when
things become too challenging. Overly Impassioned Advocates' passion for
a cause can create issues for their children at this stage if it isn't
properly balanced with their children's needs and abilities. School-aged
children certainly benefit from volunteering and standing up for their
beliefs. However, they also need parents who can help them address the
issues they face in day-to-day life. From a school crush that is not
reciprocated to the trauma of being picked last for the kickball team,
children at this age need parents who can help them deal with personal
issues that deeply affect them. Always focused on saving the world,
Advocate parents who fail to validate their children's feelings on
"smaller issues" will find that their children are less likely to seek
their help or support in the future. Sure, the world isn't going to end
if a child doesn't make the basketball team, but that can feel
catastrophic to a child. To children in this

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

165

Advocates as Parents

stage, everything that happens to them is a big deal. Advocate parents
who don't recognize this and don't help their children deal with their
issues in a balanced and effective way will ultimately struggle to
maintain a close relationship with them.

Rebalancing Parenting During the School-Age Stage Promoting Confidence
The beauty of confidence is that it is a skill that can be developed at
any age -- it's never too late to improve this particular trait.
Parenthood is a very effective motivator, and Advocate parents have
every desire to help their children be successful in life. Individuals
with this personality type are put off by self-promotion and any
behavior they view as self-serving, so they may have to overcome their
misguided belief that being confident is the same as being arrogant.
Additionally, Advocates should keep in mind how important it is for
their school-aged children to develop a sense of competence to
effectively move through this stage. Children should be encouraged to
take pride in their work and be taught to view failures as new
opportunities. Hang spelling tests they aced on the refrigerator and
celebrate with extra dessert after dinner or a (slightly) later bed time
that weekend. Children thrive when their parents acknowledge their
achievements and when they learn that their hard work will pay off. When
children fail, Advocate parents can help them dust themselves off and
look for a light at the end of that proverbial tunnel. Didn't make the
dance team? That's fine -- they can join cheerleading or debate instead!
Children who realize that failure isn't the end of the road but rather
the beginning of another path will be more confident and successful
throughout their lives.

The following tips will help Advocates improve their own self-confidence
and therefore promote it in their children: •

Write down one personal strength and how it helped you overcome a
specific challenge. ("My eloquent speaking helped me to nail my most
recent job interview.")

•

Think of something that causes fear or hesitation regularly -- possibly
a fear of failure or criticism -- and write down three things you can do
to overcome that fear (such as take a class on speaking skills to
overcome a fear of public speaking).

•

Work toward becoming an expert in a specific skill (like mastering the
guitar or becoming fluent in a second language) -- something that will
really promote a sense of competence.

•

Practice positive self-talk -- nothing brings down confidence as quickly
as the negative thoughts people have about themselves. Meeting Them
Where They Are

Well-meaning Advocates place high expectations on their children, hoping
to encourage them to make a difference in the world. Unfortunately, when
the focus is constantly on what is expected, parents are apt to miss out
on what their children really need. What children need most from their
parents is unconditional love and acceptance, and Advocate parents are
more than capable of providing this for their children. Advocates who
are prone to fixating on the "big picture" can benefit from focusing on
what their children are dealing with in the moment. Rather than trying
to hammer a square peg (an Advocate parent's idea of what is important)
into a round hole (what

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

167

Advocates as Parents

the child thinks is important), parents should make a point to engage
with their children in the "here and now." Some ideas for doing this
include: •

Start a gratitude practice where both parent and child state three
things they are grateful for that day and one thing that is bothering
them.

•

Begin a mindfulness practice such as a short meditation to promote being
"in the moment."

•

Have a weekly or monthly appointment when parent and child can engage in
an activity together (such as hitting up an arcade, taking a hike, or
checking out a museum).

Adolescence (From Approximately 12 to 18 Years) Adolescence is the
transition from childhood to adulthood, a time when children focus on
developing their own distinct identity. This transitional period centers
around an individual's sense of their role in relationships: with
themselves, friends, family, and society in general. To determine their
roles, adolescents in this stage begin the all-important process of
identifying their personal values and beliefs. Educational and future
career goals are made and relationships are formed based on these values
and beliefs, making this a pivotal, foundational stage for the rest of
their lives.

Balanced Parenting During Adolescence Promoting Positive Values During
this stage of identity development, children need their parents' support
and understanding more than ever. Advocate parents encourage their
adolescents' growth by promoting positive values, such as respect,
compassion, and integrity, "The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

168

Advocates as Parents

while also providing them with freedom to explore any other values that
inspire them. Mature Advocates understand the importance of allowing
their children to go through the difficult yet necessary process of
personal development with the proper balance of support and space.
Regardless of the struggles their children may face during this
tumultuous time, Advocates remain steadfast in their devotion. Their
dedication, both to their children and to the promotion of positive
values, provides a solid foundation for Advocate parents and their
children. This foundation allows identity-seeking children to venture
further into self-discovery while still feeling supported and loved.
Unconditional Love and Commitment Advocate parents' unconditional love
and support are indispensable as they help their children cope with the
many challenges they will face. Discoveries are often made through trial
and error, so many mistakes will be made during this stage. An
adolescent who skips class needs to know that their actions have
consequences but that their parents will still love them regardless of
their mistakes. Children at this stage are more likely to communicate
with their parents if they are confident that they will not be judged:
They must feel that their parents' love and acceptance will not be
revoked. This is especially true when they deal with issues that are
truly serious -- such as getting pregnant, getting suspended or
expelled, even going through a particularly rough breakup. Advocate
parents who stay loving toward their children during these dilemmas can
establish themselves as a true source of empathy and wisdom when their
children need it most. As overwhelming and terrifying as some of these
scenarios may seem, Advocates who tap into their compassion and empathy
can

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

169

Advocates as Parents

confront these situations from a place of wisdom rather than one of
panic. They should treat their adolescents with respect -- but still
strive be the wise, understanding adults in the room.

Unbalanced Parenting During Adolescence Imposing Ideals Similar to the
issues they may have faced during their children's toddler years,
Advocates may struggle with adolescents' burgeoning independence.
Advocates are very accepting of the pursuit of personal development, but
they may have their own ideas about what this process should look like
and what values their children should espouse. A vegan parent may be
personally offended when their adolescent suddenly becomes a
bacon-obsessed meat-eater. Likewise, Advocates with passionate political
or religious views may find their children's desire to explore
"oppositional" beliefs insulting, as though they've been personally
attacked. Advocate parents who believe that personal development can be
done only within specific, approved parameters -- regardless of where
those boundaries are on any scale -- may inadvertently prevent their
adolescents from going through the selfdiscovery process. They may
engage in emotionally manipulative behaviors, attempting to subtly guilt
their children into behaving (or believing) the way they want them to.
Adolescent children are unlikely to respond well to this type of
parental control and may act out in rebellious ways or stop
communicating with their parents altogether.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

Advocates as Parents

Difficulty Letting Go The adolescent stage requires that children become
more independent from their parents, making critical life choices on
their own and relying less on their parents for basic support. Advocate
parents can struggle with feelings of rejection if they believe that
their children no longer need them or desire their affection. They may
also find themselves mourning the end of childhood, remembering that
sweet kindergarten child they walked into class on the first day of
school. If they become too absorbed by a sense of loss at this stage,
Advocates can slip into an existential crisis of sorts, pining for days
gone by rather than looking forward to the opportunities that lie ahead
for both parent and child. For some Advocates, parenthood is their
"cause" -- being a parent is the most important part of their identity.
If they fail to maintain or nurture other parts of their identity
throughout their children's younger years, Advocate parents may
fervently hold on to their role as primary caregiver. If parenting has
prevented them from maintaining friendships, pursuing meaningful
hobbies, or engaging in work that they enjoy, Advocates may feel lost
and lonely as their children inevitably begin to spend more time away
from home. They may begin to experience bitterness, a deep sense of
loss, and even a sense of panic about the uncertainty of their own
future, with this defining role of parent no longer at life's center.

Rebalancing Parenting During Adolescence Celebrating Individual Ideals
Discovering ideals that are personally meaningful is one of the most
important aspects of identity development for Advocates. Rather than
being offended or insulted if their children's ideals do not match their
own, mature Advocate parents

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

171

Advocates as Parents

are able to celebrate the fact that their adolescents have gone through
the process of self-discovery. When their children understand right and
wrong and have a welldeveloped moral compass, Advocates can take a step
back and appreciate a parenting job well done. The best way for parents
at this stage to encourage their children to develop their own personal
ideals is to encourage them to privately focus on embracing values that
are meaningful to their individual journey. Although adolescents should
be encouraged to draw from family values during this process, Advocate
parents should avoid pressuring or guilt-tripping their children into
agreeing with their own values and beliefs. The following tips can help
Advocates focus on finding themselves while also remaining a source of
advice and inspiration to their children: •

Embrace a spiritual or meditative practice.

•

Take up (or rediscover) an artistic hobby such as writing, painting,
photography, or sewing. Practice the skill and enjoy the benefits of
creative healing and inspiration.

•

Engage in self-reflection through journaling or even guided counseling
to better understand who you are and who you would like to become.
Promoting Healthy Independence

The adolescent stage requires that children become more independent from
their parents, which is especially difficult for Advocates who thrive on
being their children's caretaker or stake their own identify primarily
as a parent. Rather than taking this desire for independence as a
personal affront, Advocate parents should learn to view

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

172

Advocates as Parents

this new stage as both a beautiful and necessary part of their
children's personal evolution. Advocate parents should encourage their
children to take responsibility for their decisions and celebrate any
progress they make toward becoming self-sufficient adults. Finding new
ways to engage at this stage that take advantage of adolescents'
burgeoning skills is a wonderful way to bond. The following are just a
few ways that Advocate parents can spend time with their adolescent
children and explore new hobbies or causes: •

Join your children in one of their favorite hobbies or activities,
whether it's running, cooking, singing, or playing video games.

•

Find or re-discover a spiritual practice to engage in together (anything
from a religious practice to meditation, yoga, or tai chi).

•

Audit a college course that parent and child both find interesting.

•

Volunteer together at the humane society or another charity on a regular
basis.

Conclusion Parenting is one of the most challenging experiences that
anyone can face, regardless of their personality type. Advocates have
their own unique strengths -- innovation, altruism, insight, and
integrity -- which they can leverage to build positive, proactive
relationships with their children. Parenting brings tremendous potential
for personal development, and Advocates can gain a much deeper
understanding of themselves and others if they use this opportunity to
do so.

The advice provided above is based on general growth stages for children
and basic strengths and weaknesses that many Advocates share. Every
child is different, and parents are the best judges of what their
children need. Parents should use the advice above in a way that works
best for their own families: If following a tip leads to more stress,
frustration, or burden, set it aside, and try something else. For
special situations, such as behavioral or medical issues, it is best to
consult with a professional pediatrician or pediatric psychologist. With
their training and expertise, they can help create a plan that works for
everyone involved.

War, poverty, racism -- these are some of the most fundamental problems
we face as a species. Many see these ills as unfortunate but,
ultimately, the way of the world. For those people, trying to change
things may be considered futile. Advocates, however, balk at this apathy
and instead dedicate their lives to eradicating one or more of society's
ills. This moral obligation permeates their studies as well. Advocates
don't learn just to learn; they learn with purpose. Every book they
read, every essay they write, and every debate they participate in adds
to a well-rounded knowledge base to aid them -- and others -- in the
future. Advocates consider learning to be enlightenment, as knowledge
wipes away ignorance. Unlike some idealists who simply dream of a better
and more just world, Advocates work tirelessly to make their visions
realities. Their drive is summed up perfectly in a quote from
civil-rights activist Angela Davis: "I am no longer accepting the things
I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept."

Advocates' Academic Path

Lacking Interest in the Mundane Despite their noble intentions,
Advocates are as liable as any human beings to run afoul. The road to
wisdom is rewarding, but it can be rocky. They experience this rockiness
firsthand when they come face-to-face with aspects of education that
seem over-technical, robotic, or mundane, like standardized testing and
uninteresting mandatory classes. Advocates require a strong personal
connection to a topic to feel fully invested, and they may question the
importance of material that holds no interest for them. Their
imaginations run deep, causing them to think of all the things that
could be done. They may even feel trapped in subjects that don't apply
to the mission they've set for themselves. These types they take issue
with benchmarks set for the sake of standardization -- they can become
annoyed when required to take numerous tests that have little to do with
subject mastery, but rather how well one can study. This aversion to the
mundane may lead Advocates to completely avoid, and perhaps discount,
whatever doesn't fall within their realm of interest. Honing in on a
Vision Throughout history, Advocates have been famous for their
extraordinary impact on the world, including leading revolutions against
the unjust, championing the people, and changing society through
dedication and hard-honed vision. For Advocates, depth matters over
breadth. Whether their goal is to end systemic poverty or improve the
local kindergarten's literature program, they give it all their focus
and drive. From the time they're young, Advocates' intuition has already
started to shape their goals. When they're asked in class what they want
to be when they grow up,

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

176

Advocates' Academic Path

they're likely to have clear ideas and sustained intent to follow
through well into their adult lives. This sustained intent may manifest
itself as joining the high school newspaper staff, then majoring in
journalism in college, with the eventual goal of winning a Peabody Award
for investigative journalism for covering the government of a far-off,
neglected, impoverished country. All they need is a goal, and they begin
mapping the steps from point "A" to point "B."

How Advocates Learn Extraordinarily passionate about their causes,
Advocates channel all their energy into achieving their goals. That
said, they also possess the wherewithal to understand that their causes
may have flaws. Their moral compass dictates that they hold strong in
their convictions; but more than that, it dictates that they be
reasonable, levelminded people who can listen to others. They are, after
all, part of the Diplomat Role group, whose goals are often defined by
the needs of others. These types recognize that communicating with those
others is essential to choosing the right path.

Balanced Learning Habits In an academic setting, Advocates might
disagree with other students or teachers, but they also take the time to
listen to their perspectives. When they get a low grade on a paper,
Advocates take the balanced approach of discussing with the professor
what the paper was missing and how they can improve their work next
time. The grade may be upsetting, but it's also how the academic system
communicates that there's room for growth, something Advocates
inherently value -- so they listen.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

Considering Impact In addition to being attentive listeners and careful
thinkers, Advocates possess insatiable curiosity, directed particularly
at culture and other humanistic enterprises. For them, such activities
represent the very essence of humanity at its best. They may agree with
the following quote from the film Dead Poets Society: "We don't read and
write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are
members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion.
And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and
necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are
what we stay alive for." Advocates are more than just motivated by
creative and artistic endeavors; these are often some of the main
reasons they love life. Although they can certainly make themselves
knowledgeable in any field, from the physical sciences to math,
economics, business, and beyond, they always feel most at home being of
service to the heart and soul of human expression. That's why, when it
comes to school, Advocates are often concerned with what their art or
work portrays. Although public opinion may be important, Advocates
absolutely must feel personally fulfilled. They check in with their
emotions and intuition to see whether decisions feel right. They pursue
fields that make them feel whole and at peace -- and walk away from
those that are noble but ultimately not for them. Trying the Mundane
Advocates specialize in subjects that have great meaning to them, but
they also understand the need to learn "mundane" skills: doing their
taxes, filling out checks, changing a tire, etc. Within the realm of
academics, this could take the form of

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

178

Advocates' Academic Path

developing long-term study habits for classes they don't enjoy.
Advocates understand that such skills, though not visionary and
inspiring, are necessary in everyday life.

Rather than shrugging off things they aren't inherently interested in,
Advocates dig in their heels and at least attempt to master the material
in front of them. They're propelled forward by the sense that the slog
of mundane learning is only temporary, and that the skills they're
learning will support work they consider meaningful.

Unbalanced Learning Habits Obsessing About Impact Solving the unsolvable
can take a toll on even the hardiest individuals, and Advocates can
exaggerate this tendency. By shouldering the burdens of the world, they
risk being crushed beneath the weight. Feeling that they personally
can't be at peace until they become ideal versions of themselves, they
can become obsessive in their learning behaviors, leaving little time in
their schedules for relaxation and self-care. In extreme cases,
Advocates may even skip meals or lose sleep as they study through their
lunch breaks or read late into the night. Such workaholic tendencies,
though intense, have limits to their scope. When left alone too long
with their thoughts, Advocates may develop "tunnel vision" and
relentlessly pursue areas of study that seem most relevant. They may
become perfectionistic, worrying that the papers they write are the
absolute best they can produce, or going over endless possible solutions
to problems. It may even get to the point where they temporarily
eliminate all forms of enjoyment and relaxation to

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

179

Advocates' Academic Path

reach their goals more quickly. Unfortunately, work done under stress
and exhaustion often lacks the quality of work done by a well-rested
mind. Opposing Alternatives Approaching differing views with patience
and open-mindedness works for some Advocates, but others struggle. Some
Advocates dismiss the idea of spending time or attention to branch out.
They may even justify their opposition as a moral imperative. Although
people with this personality type may be visionaries when it comes to
the broader strokes of their plans, no one can anticipate exactly what
the future holds. By holding too stubbornly to their beliefs, they may
disregard conflicting but essential data, or entire fields of research
and discussion, rather than revising their worldviews to accommodate
them. This reluctance to accommodate alternative views is a result of
Advocates' combined Intuitive and Judging traits. In their minds, they
see the ideal (perhaps "perfect") way to do things -- the correct answer
to the question, the appropriate experiment to conduct for an unknown
variable, or the most effective way to present a group project -- and
they may try to mold imperfect models to match the images in their
minds. However, the pursuit of singular, perfect solutions can lead them
to ignore the possibility that they could be wrong. Failing an Idealized
Self Advocates have an ideal vision of the world, but that vision begins
with themselves: well-educated, well-spoken, open-minded, perpetually
kind, and never willing to "settle for less." This, however, is an
unrealistic expectation to have for anyone. Unfortunately, soft-hearted
Advocates are particularly hard on themselves for mistakes that everyone
makes. Their strict moral philosophy relies on determination

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

180

Advocates' Academic Path

and goodness, which may make it difficult for Advocates to even consider
settling for "failure," as they see it as a flaw rather than a normal
human experience. A failing grade isn't necessarily a problem, but it
can be assigned exaggerated meaning. For example, Advocates may think
that failing a law class will risk their chances of becoming future
reformers of the criminal justice system, or that not meeting their own
expectations in an art class undermines their identities as creative
people. Failure seems like a direct threat to their identities and may
lead them to believe that a "C" in a class directly correlates to
unfulfilled ambitions. They may think terrible -- but false -- thoughts
about themselves, deeming themselves unintelligent, incapable of
effective or productive work, or otherwise lacking compared to other
students. If the core aspects of their identity come under fire, it can
leave Advocates feeling destroyed.

Rebalancing Learning Habits Taking Their Own Advice Food, sleep, and
even leisure time are all necessities, not luxuries, a fact that
Advocates are quick to remind others but slow to accept for themselves.
When these types make personal sacrifice a routine, they soon find that
they have nothing left for others and even themselves. It's important
for these types to make daily routines a priority, not an afterthought.
When scheduling time for meals, rest, and relaxation (using an alarm can
be a good reminder to take a break), quality can be as crucial as
quantity. A series of two- and three-hour naps interspersed throughout
the day won't equal eight hours of uninterrupted rest, though a
20-minute nap in addition to solid nightly rest makes a tremendous
difference. Also, a fast-food breakfast burrito gobbled down during a

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

181

Advocates' Academic Path

commute may fill you up, but it can't compare to a balanced breakfast
with a loved one. Here are some steps Advocates can take to assess and
fulfill their needs: •

Consider what specifically is missing in your life. Do you need quiet?
Sleep? Stability?

•

Consider how you currently spend your time. Are your primary needs being
met? Before answering, consider how you would advise a loved one: For
instance, would you chastise a friend for taking a short nap after a
heavy study session?

•

Select one need that is not being met and then implement some short
increments of time when you focus on meeting that need: 10 minutes for a
nap, an hour to cook a good meal, 30 minutes of cuddling with a
significant other.

•

Schedule time every day, preferably at the same time, to fulfill that
one need. Discussing in Good Faith

Most Advocates hate the phrase "for the sake of argument." They're more
likely to believe in universal, "capital-T Truths," and they dream of
universal agreement. However, even if such certainties exist, these
types hardly have a monopoly on them. Leaving the door open for
reasonable doubts and opposing views can reveal new, unconsidered
worlds, even if doing so detracts from their zeal. Although empty
contrarianism is annoying, the role of informed devil's advocate, played
by trusted friends or other credible sources (or even by Advocates
themselves), should be valued, not dismissed.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

182

Advocates' Academic Path

This can work especially well when it comes to drafting papers that
respond to an issue at hand. Rather than relying only on their personal
views, Advocates can instead open themselves to other schools of
thought. Learning more about contrary ideas allows them to see their
arguments' weak points as well as strengths, and it allows them to
present well-rounded papers that address both sides. The same thing can
be said for group projects: When it comes to collaboration, the best
ideas come from respectful discussion and debate.

Here are some tips for Advocates to pursue discussions in good faith.
When considering a topic or individual that directly opposes your
beliefs: •

Ask the individual "how?" and "why?"

•

Research the conflicting idea.

•

Process the information without making any initial judgments; give the
idea the benefit of the doubt.

•

See how the new idea compares against the existing knowledge set.
Creating Diversified Identities

When determined, Advocates are relentless in their pursuit. No matter
what it takes -- blood, sweat, or tears -- they achieve their goals once
they're decided upon. The problem, however, may become a lack of
awareness for anything beyond their goals. Advocates' dedication is
amazing, but it can also be limiting. In academics, these types may make
the mistake of pigeonholing themselves in one subject. They may even
focus exclusively on everything relevant to their long-term goal --
running an independent business, for example -- without also spending
time exploring other interests.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

183

Advocates' Academic Path

To achieve balance, they can make time to research their interests, then
dedicate at least an hour a week to them: Joining the astronomy club,
reading a book on Antarctica, or listening to informational videos
online are all worthy pursuits. Some simple steps toward this goal
include: •

Think back on things of interest that you didn't try because they
weren't relevant to your long-term goals. For example, perhaps you
enjoyed a theater class but decided against taking another one because
it would have taken time away from pursuing a program of study in
organic chemistry.

•

Sign up for casual events that don't require huge time commitments, like
oncea-week after-school improv sessions rather than a daily one-hour
class.

•

After you become involved, take the time to decide whether the interest
is enriching. If so, take active steps to stay involved.

Advocates in High School Selectively Brilliant In the teachers' lounge,
while discussing an Advocate high school student they have in common,
instructors in different subjects may feel like they're talking about
completely different people. One might experience the students as
laconic, listless, and dull; but to another teacher, the same student
can be a bright, focused, and driven member of every discussion. When
Advocates connect with a subject, their precociousness becomes evident,
whether in a presentation on the deeply moral themes of Dostoevsky's
novel Crime and Punishment or a stirring essay on the history of the
American Civil Rights movement. Their classmates may see such work as a
tedious but necessary hurdle

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

184

Advocates' Academic Path

on the path to graduation, but Advocates may experience the kindling of
a passion for moral justice that burns for the rest of their days.
Learning for Authenticity The humanities and social sciences strike a
natural chord within young Advocates' hearts, but they may experience
dissonance when exposed to less soulful studies. Math and science
certainly aren't beyond their grasp, but they can perform poorly without
some means of putting rote facts, figures, and seemingly arbitrary
calculations into a broader human context. Their lack of interest in
such classes may frustrate teachers and parents alike as they struggle
to comprehend how academic passion could be distributed so unevenly.
Advocates' curious behavior is a consequence of their steady inner
compass, lending them a quiet, fierce integrity that makes them mature
beyond their years. At a time when their peers' identities are malleable
as clay, these types are stubborn marble. Others' approval matters to
them, but remaining in sync with their ideals always matters more. The
need to "fit in," which looms so large in the minds of many teens, is
widely rejected by Advocates, for whom popularity is a foreign currency,
while authenticity is worth far more than gold.

Balanced High School Learning Some students can scarcely be bothered to
crack a textbook, and academic curiosity often amounts to a single
question "Will this be on the test?" Advocates may find themselves
excused from their shortcomings in some subjects because of the
commitment they show to the topics that matter to them. However, those
who take advantage of overworked teachers' low expectations are hardly
living up to their potential. Nor will aggressively pushing them out of
their comfort zones lead to much

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

185

Advocates' Academic Path

success, either. Advocates can balance some of their academic reluctance
by approaching learning with open minds and realistic standards.
Remaining Open to Possibilities A fortunate few Advocates may encounter
teachers who supply inspirational context for every stray fact or
theorem, discussing not whether it's on the test, but why it matters.
But most of the time, Advocates must sharpen their contextualization
skills on their own to excel in subjects that don't come to them
readily. They are fully capable of this when they see the situation with
a balanced point of view, staving off adolescent cynicism and realizing
the value of their early education. For example, sketching the chemical
structure of a hydrocarbon may seem like busywork -- until Advocates
begin to ruminate on the possibilities of chemistry to solve world
hunger or cure devastating diseases. The motivating potential of
Advocates' passion can't be understated. They just need to be exposed to
bodies of knowledge and ideas they didn't think they were interested in.
To let down their guard and open themselves up to such alternatives,
they can look to the Socratic paradox for inspiration: "I know one
thing: that I know nothing." The sooner they recognize that hard,
unforgiving work is necessary to make their visions a reality and that
there is always room for their insights to grow, the sooner they'll be
able to take meaningful steps toward realizing a better world. Realistic
Standards Advocates subscribe to a work ethic that correlates directly
with their passion, and they keep working without breaks when passion is
ignited. They dislike the idea of not fulfilling their commitments and
moral obligations. That said, Advocates who

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

186

Advocates' Academic Path

approach their studies with a balanced mindset aren't keen on
sacrificing their health to meet goals, nor are they overly
perfectionistic. They do what they can to turn in quality work but avoid
agonizing over the details when there's no more to gain. They schedule
time to commit the effort needed to succeed, but they set realistic
expectations. Hard-working Advocates aren't completely against letting
loose occasionally. They take their interests very seriously, yes, but
they aren't completely against hanging out with friends on a school
night -- taking the time to remember that they're just teenagers. Nobody
is expected to have everything figured out, and much of their joy is in
the discovery.

Unbalanced High School Learning Dismissing Details Advocates who spend
math class reading English literature may not be the picture of teenage
rebellion, but their grades can plummet as surely as if their time was
spent shooting spitballs or sending secret texts. In a larger sense,
Advocates who pursue their narrow scholarly obsessions with no concern
for the broader curriculum may discover that knowledge gaps limit them
in unforeseeable ways. Budding environmentalists with a tenuous grasp of
the underpinnings of climate science may be able to convince only the
already-converted. Ignoring finer details is a troublesome habit for
those who indulge only their interests, one that can hinder their
progress even in classes they otherwise wholeheartedly engage in. Young
Advocates with a passion for history intuitively may understand the
importance of individual events but not feel the need to memorize actual
dates for a test. Students with a more literary bent might have points
deducted

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

187

Advocates' Academic Path

from even the most articulate essay due to a failure to properly cite
their sources. Their refusal to meet the demands of a rigid curriculum
can hold them back, in both the short and long term. A few such bad
experiences may cause them to drift away from an academic path that
previously felt like destiny, in which they could have done lots of
good. Impossible Standards Another hurdle for Advocates to overcome in
high school is their relentless internal perfectionism and noble
ambition, which all too often manifest as work turned in late or not at
all. Having bitten off more than they can chew and refusing to "cut
corners" or take an easier path, some may discover they can't possibly
get done what they set out to achieve in the time allotted, leading to
stress, rushed work, and missed deadlines. No matter how exhaustive the
research or articulate the writing, a term paper on the history of
capital punishment that is delivered two weeks after the term ends will
probably be greeted with the same unenthusiastic response -- and a grade
to match -- as an essay that still exists only in the realm of the
Advocate's imagination.

Rebalancing High School Learning Forming a Connection Attending to
details, no matter how mundane, is an important part of life. Ask any
student who has graduated high school only to wonder how to apply for
financial aid for college, how to interview properly for a job, or how
to keep track of deadlines. Advocates try not to neglect their work, but
they may feel reluctant to lend the same passion to "mundane" topics as
they do to their preferred subjects. However, to rebalance this, they
must choose to have faith that such banal, technical, and day-today
information will one day prove its value.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

188

Advocates' Academic Path

One possible approach is developing a mentor relationship with the
instructor of a class that's giving them trouble. This can help
Advocates understand where the instructor is coming from while also
adding depth to the course by filtering it through the lens of that
instructor's perspective. It's no longer geology, it's Ms. Smith's
passion for the Earth expressed through teaching, a childhood dream that
found a way into the real world. Now this relationship, which is
something more personal, can convince Advocates to approach some of the
humdrum details -- sources to cite, dates to memorize -- as a favor to
Ms. Smith, which is something Advocates are geared toward naturally.
It's not Ms. Smith's fault she has to hand out tests, so it's not fair
to her (or to Advocates themselves) to punish her with poor performance.
Advocates are perfectly capable of dealing with routine details if they
find a way to make them personally relevant. By creating such
relationships with their instructors, they can discover new relevance in
topics and their specifics, boosting their motivation and attention.
Tempering Perfectionism High school is difficult. With the added
pressures of the future, parents, peers, and extracurricular activities,
it can be exhausting to even the most laid-back people -- and downright
back-breaking to expectation-laden Advocates. Always looking to do their
best in whatever they commit to, Advocates often sacrifice themselves to
sustain their other obligations. Advocates who learn to take a kinder,
more measured view of themselves may find that their accomplishments and
efforts, even if they fall short of an idealized vision, are still worth
taking pride in. This is the principle expressed in the Japanese
aesthetic

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

189

Advocates' Academic Path

concept of wabi sabi: Perfection lacks depth. In flaws and fragility,
real beauty is discovered. Practicing imperfection in small ways --
trying to paint a photo-realistic image with little painting experience,
for example -- can help build a sense that failure is acceptable, even
necessary: a critical aspect of self-acceptance in the learning process.
With this in mind, Advocates can resolve to learn the way children do,
with unencumbered wonder and exploration. Young Advocates can develop
healthy school-life balance by creating a schedule that makes room for
real life. A schedule isn't just a productivity-boosting tool:
Allocating time for chores and assignments makes it easier to set aside
time for friends, as well as time to be alone and relax. Schedules allow
Advocates to press the "off" button they usually deny themselves; this
is a personal act of kindness -- and a sanity-saver. Setting realistic
expectations for their time allows teenagers to enjoy their lives. Some
suggestions to help Advocate students rebalance: •

Create a fixed schedule. Work when needed, and rest when it's over. For
example: Dedicate one hour to studying during school hours (study hall,
perhaps) and two hours after school. In those two hours, focus on the
most important tasks first -- an essay due next week, five math
equations, 30 minutes of assigned reading -- and then close everything
once those two hours are up.

•

Eliminate distractions during scheduled study time. Turn off the phone,
log out of social media, and avoid social situations that would
interfere with getting the work finished.

•

Relax after time is up. Finally sitting down to finish that TV show that
has been in your Netflix cue for two months can be a terrific way to
reward yourself for a job well done.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

Advocates' Academic Path

Work or College By many measures, Advocates are an uncommon personality
type, but they still face a common dilemma when leaving high school.
Should they immediately go into the world of work, or should they
continue their studies? For some Advocates, the choice is obvious:
academic certification is a requirement for several occupations these
types might be drawn to, including teaching, psychotherapy, and law. If
they don't attend college, the doors they long to open will remain
closed to them. Some Advocates have a non-negotiable stopover on their
journey to becoming the people they wish to be. The college experience
doesn't have to be a chore. In fact, many Advocates find their crusade
for social justice, tempered beneath their stoicism, to be an integral
part of the curriculum. Through the simple camaraderie of so many
like-minded people -- finally! -- their flower of rebellion finds space
to bloom. Even so, Advocates are usually too mission-oriented to remain
in academia for long before venturing out to put theory into practice.
Some choose work over college because they can't bear the costs of
college -- whether personal, financial, practical, or principled -- or
because their zeal for change is so potent that it just can't be
deferred any longer. Without the guidance of education or their parents,
they may need time to define themselves and their goals. It's reasonable
to accept more basic positions like waiting tables or doing physical
work while continuing a path of self-discovery outside the regimen of
school and parental oversight. Working to support interests and save
money, whether for eventual schooling or some other future interest, is
a balanced reason to delay school in favor of work.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

191

Advocates' Academic Path

Others know full well what they want and find rewarding careers by
climbing up the corporate ladder or working for themselves. They might
also take paths somewhere in between, leveraging recognition for their
community service to secure a role in a not-for-profit organization, or
using their passion for writing to contribute freelance articles as an
activist while still dealing with the reality of paying the bills. It's
important for Advocates to realize that many roads can be rewarding. If
they truly wish to build a better world, they'll find a way to do so,
even if their role is smaller -- or merely different -- than they had
originally anticipated.

Balanced Decision-Making Embracing Honesty It's important for Advocates
to consider their options with unwavering honesty. The difficulty of
this task shouldn't be underestimated. When surveying the world through
a healthy lens, Advocates know perhaps better than anyone how good
people are at deceiving themselves. They may be tempted to believe that,
because they see it in others, they're immune to it themselves. They can
ask themselves questions, consult with friends and mentors, gather a
range of opinions and information, and perform other reality checks to
help orient and clarify their worldviews. Any option can be just the
challenge Advocates need to move their visions forward, or a means of
escape from the weight of responsibility. It can be all too easy to
convince themselves that one is the same as the other. When honest and
patient with themselves, they can distinguish between an obstacle and an
excuse, then progress.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

192

Advocates' Academic Path

Following Through Advocates leaning toward college understand that it's
a long commitment, though following through on a conviction is hardly a
challenge for this type. They recognize that time spent on
self-improvement isn't an exercise in narcissism. This is especially
true if it provides them with the credentials necessary for entering a
helping profession that delivers good to humanity, or a complex
intellectual and moral framework for handling the personal or global
problems they long to solve. When taking a balanced approach, Advocates
embrace the idea that college isn't an abdication of responsibility but
an acceptance of it, if time there is used effectively. Advocates who
don't attend college can still find ways to advance their goals.
Entrylevel jobs in the service industry can be meaningful if Advocates
find satisfaction in their community of coworkers and customers. Such
positions can also support them financially while they volunteer for a
social cause they consider to be their "true" career, especially if the
skills they develop during their volunteer work make them more viable
candidates for positions in the nonprofit sector.

Unbalanced Decision-Making Eternal Waiting In unbalanced Advocates,
their combination of imagination and perfectionism can manifest as
inaction. The period after high school is a time of exceptional personal
consequence, and unbalanced Advocates can allow the weightiness of
decisions sink them into inaction. Their imaginations, though a powerful
tool, can work against Advocates, as they envision a perfectly formed
solution falling into their lap.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

193

Advocates' Academic Path

The habit of waiting for the "right" opportunities while ignoring other
viable options can be supremely unhealthy. Advocates may wait for signs
from the universe to dictate their next course of action, spending more
time deciding if something feels right rather than making it feel right.
Those who spend years agonizing over a course of study or employment may
find that, in retrospect, little was gained from excessive deliberation,
and much perhaps was lost. Haunted Rumination Choices that are later
seen as "wrong" have a way of haunting Advocates. When they have an
unbalanced view of their own decisions, they overanalyze not only future
decisions but also past decisions, with little self-confidence or
self-forgiveness. Learning to live with their choices is as necessary as
making choices in the first place. What some Advocates may not realize
is that endless rumination and selfconsumption are choices in and of
themselves. Thinking through choices helps avoid future mistakes, but it
also can keep Advocates from acting, and that inactivity can cost far
more than either time spent in school or a more intentional push into
the professional world.

Rebalancing Decision-Making Adjusting Course There's a fine line between
deliberation and procrastination, and Advocates need to work harder than
most to distinguish between the two. Their tendency to delay stems,
ironically, from their need to commit to a course of action. When they
feel that nothing can be undone, their only choice is well-considered
decisions, but what counts as "well-considered" can be altered to fit
any mood. The question is, does this

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

194

Advocates' Academic Path

deliberation arise out of sensible caution or a lack of self-confidence
to step into the unknown? Advocates must learn to understand that few
decisions are permanent. Changing their minds based on new information
is their prerogative -- and a sign of maturity. Snap decision-making
feels unnatural to Advocates, but those who err a bit more on the side
of rashness may find that even when they make a wrong choice, the
consequences may not be nearly as irreversible as they had feared. Here
are some steps for Advocates considering their course, as it's never too
late to act: •

Request a tour of a local university.

•

Attend the orientation of a university or local college.

•

Request an informational interview at an interesting company or
nongovernmental organization.

Advocates don't have to make a commitment to do these things. They're
simply obtaining information, and they should feel no pressure to sign
up for anything that isn't inspiring. Hopefully, though, the rush of
inspiration will fill them again -- and then, voilà, they're off on
another life chapter. Finding Inspiration in Others Not everything calls
for Advocates' admirable dedication to examining root causes and first
principles. People with this personality type are often best served by
ignoring their impulse to build from scratch and instead embracing faith
in humanity. Trusting the efforts of others who came before them
sometimes requires repeated

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

195

Advocates' Academic Path

failures to improve on processes that were already in common use.
Trusting previous work makes it possible to build on others'
accomplishments to advance vital causes. Besides saving time that might
be wasted re-inventing the wheel, these little leaps of faith are
personally essential for a personality type who puts so much stock in
the well-being of humanity. Without faith -- in the people they're
trying to work with and help, and in the individuals who are seeking to
help them -- Advocates deem little worth fighting for. A huge reason
these types procrastinate is because they're not sure where to begin.
They can remedy this by utilizing those around them for research,
support, and perspective: •

Find others you admire, preferably mentors you're close to or local
entrepreneurs whose work you follow.

•

Have in-depth conversations with them about their own academic paths.

•

Ask questions like, "When you were my age, did you know what you wanted
to do?" and "How many times did you stumble on your path?"

When looking at the greats, we often see only their accomplishments:
Bitter nights and horrid failures are edited out as history makes men
and women into myths and legends. The truth is that everyone fails, even
the prodigies and the talented. Advocates shouldn't fear failure: As the
adage goes, "The master has failed more times than the beginner has
tried."

Advocates in College Disappearing Mirage Younger Advocates who chafed
against the strict schedules and curricula of high school may initially
see the university ivory tower as a welcome hermitage, a place where
their burgeoning ideas can, at last, begin to take shape. The liberty of
higher learning can be a boon to budding Advocates, but college has its
challenges. Those who are lulled by the siren song of endless electives
and roving Socratic discussions may be rudely awakened by the steeper
expectations and heavy workload inherent in high education. Not to say
their dreams for college are illusory, only that Advocates are often
caught flat-footed by the shift, having strode so easily through their
previous academic years. College may be the first time these types will
confront the disconnect between their ideals and reality (but hardly the
last!). Bridging this gap can propel Advocates through life; college is
frequently an amenable practice ground for conflicts and challenges to
come. Their guiding spirit of principled rebellion, often misunderstood
in the more rigid environs of high school, may serve them well in
college, where they're likely to encounter professors and classmates who
encourage what a little pushback does to open up a conversation. Growing
into Themselves Few Advocates are satisfied restricting their moral
deconstruction to the classroom. Their fellow students may appear more
riotous in their attempts to break from tradition -- juvenile campus
pranks, shadowy hazing rituals, and all-night keggers -- Advocates'
revolts are quieter and filled with purpose. For them, extracurricular
activities aren't limited to intramural sports and amateur stagecraft.
They include "The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

197

Advocates' Academic Path

campaigns and protests, each a response to some egregious policy or
action that they couldn't stand to see go unchallenged. After all, they
seek to change the world -- so why not start with the institutions that
are supposed to represent that change?

Advocates, as they grow more into themselves, learn the difference
between protesting for meaningful change and protesting over every hurt
feeling. They come to know where their efforts do the greatest good, as
they look a problem's underlying cause rather than fight with every
symptom of it. This means setting aside some battles, passing over a
scrape so they can survey the broken leg; knowing when to do that is a
balanced approach to their revolutionary spirit. It's also important
that "Advocates" not become "Adversaries," at least not entirely. If
they're going to protest, it should be an act of communication with the
other side, rather than demonization, or they will only polarize the
issue and make others feel as though they need to defend themselves.

Balanced College Life Understanding Others Advocates may struggle to
reconcile their utopian ideal of the university experience with the
shabbier realities of campus life. Just as they once looked askance at
high school classmates who viewed study solely as a means to an end --
get good grades to get into a good college -- Advocates in college are
equally puzzled by university students who see their degree as merely a
passport to higher-paying work. The same confusion about this attitude
that drove them to deep introspection as adolescents draws their
attention outward in college. Advocates' passion is fierce, and when it
is marshaled in the service of their studies, few can match their rigor
or eloquence.

Advocates' Academic Path

Advocates who make the effort to understand others remember that
compromise is essential to their goals, even if it sometimes feels like
politics. They do not need to compromise their values, however -- after
all, the changes they strive for are usually social ones, and no
movement for social justice has rested entirely on the back of one
person, no quest for equity on unilateral action. Forging alliances to
broaden acceptance is an essential skill for Advocates to master.
Fortunately, they're excellent listeners, and if they learn to
incorporate what they hear into what they say, they can build support
for their ideas. Learning beyond Coursework People with this personality
type enjoy classes within their chosen field, but the same general
education courses that left them cold in high school are no more
compelling in their college incarnations, and they are just as much a
requirement. Advocates who summoned the discipline to conquer these
obstacles back then may have less trouble doing so now because they have
at least the semblance of choice in the matter. This is assuming they
neither attempt to get those courses all out of the way in the beginning
(potentially souring their college experience from the outset) nor save
them for last (when academic fatigue might undo all they've worked so
hard to achieve). Advocates should realize that the necessary and the
desirable can go together. They may roll their eyes at basic
prerequisites like introductory composition, perhaps even marvel at
their peers' poor writing or shallow thinking, but what they learn isn't
determined by those peers. They should instead recognize the value of
their time, commit to learning what they can from basic and advanced
studies alike, and push themselves to be creative with opportunities,
not just taking a syllabus at face value. They must recognize that in
every course, their education is in their own hands.

Unbalanced College Life A Negative Outlook Putting an idea out there for
all to judge can be difficult, and some Advocates immediately hide
behind righteousness and shoot down the suggestions of those around
them. They're certain of what's wrong but are unable to discern what's
right. Aside from the financial burden that a lengthy college career can
exact on Advocates -- whose academic debts might later force them into
professions that fulfill their fiscal needs while robbing them of their
spirit -- the mental toll shouldn't be underestimated, either. When
taking an unhealthy approach, they pursue their studies with the weight
of the world on their minds, an all-or-nothing attitude that often
exacerbates the pressures of mere academic performance. Even in the
absence of family or work responsibilities (and students often have
either or both), Advocates in college who burn too brightly risk flaming
out far too soon. False Growth Finally, a protracted academic stint (or
one that ends too soon) can exact a burden on personal growth. Unwary
Advocates can make college a gilded cage, losing themselves in a maze of
theories and ideas. All they learn only convinces them that they must
find out more, and as they do, some risk becoming comfortable, wielding
their philosophical might against younger minds in classroom
discussions, rather than trying themselves in the broader world -- the
proverbial big fish in a small pond. In some cases, this route is less
circuitous than it seems, particularly if the destination is a tenured
professorship that grants them the liberty of mind that they have long

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

Advocates' Academic Path

sought. More often, however, a protracted college stay indicates they're
only delaying the life that waits outside the cloister of academia.

Rebalancing College Life Cost-Benefit Analysis When contemplating their
path through college, Advocates might consider this thought experiment:
A genie offers them the ability to accomplish anything human beings can
achieve -- ending hunger, curing disease, providing comfort and
opportunity to the homeless, preventing war -- but it asks for two to
eight years of their lives and some percentage of future earnings as a
price in return. Is it worth it? Equating college with magic may be
far-fetched, but in a sense, this is the bargain that higher education
offers, granting the skills, experience, and, yes, credentials needed to
advance such causes. It's by no means the only path, but it's a powerful
one. To calculate their cost-benefit analysis and rebalance their
approach to college, Advocates can take the following steps: •

Contact potential mentors you admire through email or personal
introduction. Explain that you're getting in touch for advice about your
path.

•

Consult school resources and information about outreach and informed
planning.

•

Form an academic planning "dream team," made up of: o A guidance
counselor who can help you direct emotional intuition into a fulfilling
path. o Friends with personal insight regarding the chosen path.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

201

Advocates' Academic Path

o Financial planning and career counselors who can help you create a
concrete plan for the next two to four years. Advocates don't need to do
things the way their mentors lay out, but it also does no harm to gather
information from people who know the academic system well. If they find
themselves navigating the complex terrain of the collegiate world,
Advocates will find even a small amount of preparation invaluable.
Balancing the Burden For those who feel restless in a purely academic
environment, internships and volunteer work may bridge the gap, not only
giving them the sense that they're already "being the change they wish
to see in the world," but perhaps shortening their post-college
transition into that world. Advocates can overburden themselves, though.
A full course load is often more than enough to handle, and although
unpaid work may eventually lead a suitable career, those who are
supporting themselves with a part-time (or full-time) job may not have
the luxury of devoting their attention to anything more than what's
already on their plate. Though college should be taken seriously,
Advocates need not see everything they do as a matter of apocalyptic
concern. Even they need to blow off steam, and refusing to make time for
less mentally and emotionally taxing pursuits is a recipe for burnout.
Aside from making sure they get out into nature or to a festival or fair
from time to time, Advocates may want to ensure that their course
schedules always include a "fun" class, whether it directly relates to
their chosen major or not.

Here are some suggestions for Advocates who want to let loose without
guilt:

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

202

Advocates' Academic Path

•

Set aside an hour every day, dedicated solely to self-care that adheres
to these guidelines: o Nothing related to personal development. No
learning new languages, trying out computer programming, volunteering on
a campaign -- this time should be focused on relaxing the mind and body.
o Low- or no-stress activities are best. For example, while traveling
sounds like a good idea in theory to expand personal horizons, going to
a foreign country often comes with unexpected challenges. Make it easy
on yourself. o Something that is wholeheartedly enjoyable and doesn't
feel like work: Watching guilty-pleasure TV shows, for instance, or
taking long, luxurious bubble baths.

•

Schedule your time around that self-care hour. Map out the rest of your
schedule to distribute work equally to ensure that the self-care hour is
possible. It's hard to enjoy one hour of self-care if it leads to
cramming for a test the next morning.

•

Take time to enjoy life; your assignments can wait.

Lifelong Learning Lifelong learning goes beyond the rigors of school,
though a return to academia is certainly an option. Older Advocates who
have embraced themselves fully are better able to give the benefit of
the doubt to areas of study or schools of thought that might have struck
them as irrelevant -- or worse -- in their younger years.

Advocates' Academic Path

Gathering the Necessities For many, "learning" and "education" are
virtually synonymous, and both terms are bound by the formal
institutions, schools, and universities that confer certificates upon
graduation. This isn't the case for Advocates, who are often profoundly
ambivalent about the prospect of formal education, simultaneously
reverent of its potential for personal transformation, yet acutely aware
of its uses as a tool for indoctrination. As much as Advocates feel that
they're "in the world, but not of it," they might take a similar
approach to education, gathering from it what they need while being
careful to remain untainted by what they don't. To outside observers,
people with this personality type may have strange notions of what
counts as necessary. In some cases, they will discover as they mature
that there are, in fact, deficits in their knowledge base, then work
diligently to remedy their ignorance. Other Advocates, however, will
continue treading the same well-worn paths, stubbornly insisting that,
though they haven't learned everything they can know, they at least know
what's important. Forever Learning Of all the personality types,
Advocates are among those who feel most comfortable with the prospect of
lifelong learning -- the notion that education isn't a thing to possess,
nor something that must be gained from some institution, but that it is
instead a never-ending journey into the unknown. They know that their
hunger for knowledge will never be truly fulfilled, just as their yen
for justice will never be sated. All Advocates can hope for is that
every day brings them a bit closer to their unreachable ideal and that,
somehow, they can find balance in their discontent.

Balanced Lifelong Learning Joy in Learning Understanding there is beauty
in a clumsy first effort -- just as there's beauty in a child's
excitement when they first learn that red and yellow make orange --
Advocates pursue many things that too many people attempt only in
childhood, such as a new instrument, art medium, dance style, unfamiliar
sport or game, distant campsite, or hobby in nature. Many Advocates,
when content, continue to learn throughout their lives, not to prove
anything to anyone, least of all themselves, but for the joy of trying
things and getting better at them. They can do something not because it
serves some greater altruistic purpose but simply because it's fun.
Engaging the world around them with no other agenda but curiosity and a
light heart resonates with Advocates' deeply cherished authenticity, and
it is perhaps the greatest expression of their individuality. Enjoying
Learning over Improvement Self-improvement is important, but so is
enjoyment. Advocates can take a more balanced approach to lifelong
learning by taking time to appreciate the life they've developed for
themselves, as well as praise themselves for the skills they've learned.
They can also develop the ability to separate learning a new skill from
needing to perform that skill well the first time around. In fact,
Advocates may separate learning new skills from their self-image
completely. They feel accomplished when they succeed at something, but
they don't base their self-worth upon what they have learned (or failed
to learn). This personality type can accept themselves as they are but
also strive to learn when they can.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

205

Advocates' Academic Path

Unbalanced Lifelong Learning Stubborn Worldviews From an early age,
Advocates tend to formulate a cohesive set of opinions about the world.
Those who refuse to adjust their ideas when appropriate find themselves
lacking. By focusing on honing their mastery of subjects they already
have an affinity for, rather than diversifying their learning, they
often pursue only knowledge that supports their fundamental views. This
limits their growth -- and even solidifies their ignorance -- as they
focus on one thing without truly having an open mind to others. Although
some Advocates recognize and compensate for their certitude, knowing
that different perspectives bring forward different and equal truths
about the world, others unfortunately just allow their beliefs to
congeal into an impenetrable ideological mass. This can conflict with
their perception of themselves as fundamentally correct in their views.
While the world changes around them, such Advocates may be reluctant to
learn about new technologies, philosophies, or methods, always
considering their own to be better than the rest. Making the Magnificent
the Mundane Aside from the diminishing returns of a too-narrow focus,
Advocates who refuse to diversify their learning and self-exploration
risk growing weary of the very obsessions that once ignited their
passion. Their over-serious approach to knowledge robs them of the joy
of learning and discovery. Unable to divert their attentions from their
mission, whether fixing the world's suffering or exercising their moral
purity, the pure pleasure of a day off to learn a light-hearted skill
can become perverse and selfish in their eyes.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

206

Advocates' Academic Path

This unrelenting, adamant nature can hold Advocates back as powerfully
as it once propelled them forth. Once just one strong argument away from
changing the world, those suffering a severe case of burnout may be
equally certain that no such argument exists -- or if one does, everyone
else is too stubborn and apathetic to hear it. Early cynicism has its
disadvantages, but late-blooming cynicism can grip the hearts of older
Advocates and be particularly devastating. With nothing to replace their
former passion, they can quickly become despondent, so certain are they
that every alternative course was ruled out in their youth.

Rebalancing Lifelong Learning Broadening Scope The goals that Advocates
pursue are often so grand that they can consume their lives -- and many
see little reason to avoid that. Any sacrifice in the service of such
ideals seems a small price to pay for the good they can do. But that
point of view can easily grow to be quite exaggerated, and often
unhealthy. Although Advocates might spend their formative years becoming
authorities in their chosen subjects, as they mature they might find at
least some of their time better spent attaining a greater breadth of
knowledge. Seemingly unrelated topics could yield fresh insights into
their principal areas of concern. Being "set in your ways" isn't
inherently bad. However, there's always room for improving on an
existing routine. Advocates can begin by picking a contrary opinion --
considering, for example, an opposing opinion on yellow mustard when
they prefer honey mustard. Here are some steps they can follow:

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

207

Advocates' Academic Path

•

Rather than immediately dismissing an argument, choose to take time to
understand the other side. Even a small variation can loosen up the
tight grip an existing routine has on life. Begin to open new vistas of
learning by considering the following. o How your stance may appear to
others o Some benefits of what the other side is proposing o "Trying on"
the contrary opinion for a few minutes

•

Based on these small excursions: o Adjust your routine based on what you
liked or disliked. o Keep your old routines "as is" if that's what works
better. o Make the choice to apply this exploratory spirit to other
areas of your life.

There are always new experiences and new things to learn. They don't
have to be earth-shaking or life-changing. Learning can benefit life
without being too disruptive. And once Advocates rediscover the joy in
learning something new, they might choose to stretch their experiences
even more. They may find that the benefits of continued learning far
outweigh the risks. Reclaiming Innocence Advocates' greatest peril is
that learning can become a joyless process tied to endless rumination on
the injustice and misery inflicted on others. Buried in articles and
political philosophies, these types can lose touch with the human beings
those ideas represent. Learning something fun -- to craft things, or to
play an instrument -- isn't a distraction from their greater concerns.
It's an opportunity to share time and effort, to reconnect with the
friends, family members, and communities that those concerns serve. It's
a return to what makes humanity beautiful, and that upwelling of pure

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

208

Advocates' Academic Path

positive emotion can breathe new life into the darkest struggles. A good
way Advocates can do this is through simple mindfulness exercises. Here
are a few steps: •

Find an object to focus on. o A plant o A cup o A body of water

•

Take a few minutes to focus on the following aspects of the object. o
What colors are there to it? o What is the texture of its surface? o
Does it have a scent? o What are its physical features? o In what ways
has it been used in the past? o In what ways can it be used in the
future?

This simple exercise takes only about five minutes, and it can pull
Advocates out of a bad head space and into the reality around them. They
can focus on what's in front of them, how they feel in that moment,
completely unaware of the future -- just as children would.

Conclusion Education can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. For
Advocates, it's a way to advance their life goals and help them
contribute to causes they care about. But it can be so much more if
given a chance. Advocates' challenge isn't so much in the hard work of
learning. It's more about managing expectations and finding a reasonable
pace so that learning doesn't become soulless drudgery but a rewarding

Advocates' Academic Path

experience. This involves blending their passion and soft hearts with
practical, realistic expectations. By taking time for self-care, setting
plausible expectations for themselves, and finding meaning and merit in
the mundane, such balance is within their reach. They can understand
that an "A+" doesn't equate self-worth, give themselves room to fail and
to be wrong, as well as celebrate their accomplishments. People are
never simply "balanced" or "unbalanced." All of us go back and forth,
evolving and devolving. Balance is more akin to the seasons -- winter,
spring, summer, and fall. They come and go, but they always repeat.
Progress, however, comes when Advocates learn how to deal with those
seasons.

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

Advocates want to be both satisfied and challenged by their work.
Although many other types are motivated by compensation or recognition,
Advocates have different aspirations. Idealistic and creative, they seek
to use their skills and knowledge to make a difference. This section
discusses Advocates' needs regarding professional development, the
common frustrations they face, and ways they can use their strengths to
find meaning and purpose in their careers. Ultimately, we hope this
guide provides the knowledge and tools for Advocates to pursue their
ideal career paths. Meaningful Work Even stable jobs with good
compensation won't satisfy Advocates unless they feel they're helping
others on a significant level. They want to work on behalf of those who
don't have the resources to fight for themselves -- and against those
who use

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

211

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

their clout only for personal gain. For Advocates, earning money and
winning "Employee of the Month" awards matter less than honoring their
values. Meaningful work can be found in many fields, even those that
initially seem better suited to other personality types. Technical and
data-driven, engineering might seem disconnected from Advocates'
interests, but engineers tackle some of the major issues facing the
world today. This kind of big-picture usefulness brings out the best in
Advocates, whatever their field. Nor are people with this personality
type limited within cubicle walls. They might derive satisfaction from
helping customers find ingredients for healthy meals, finish up home
projects, or host events. Because they're driven by a sense of purpose,
Advocates tend to thrive in a range of professions. Creativity and
Insight In addition to a sense of meaning, Advocates need to have
creativity in their work. The best careers for them combine innovation
with a relatively high degree of independence. Adept at spotting
opportunities to step in and make a difference, they will likely feel
constrained when they can't pursue such desires. Their needs may be
incompatible with some work environments, particularly those driven by
profit rather than service. High-pressure sales and cutthroat business
practices are particularly distasteful to people with this personality
type. When an employer's priorities don't match their own, many
establish their independence -- either by assuming leadership positions
or by starting their own companies.

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

Personal and Professional Growth For Advocates, "professional growth"
has little to do with promotions and pay increases. They want to learn
and develop, growing their skills as well as their understanding. Thanks
to this mindset, they have the capacity to achieve amazing things and
the determination to put their idealism to work. Despite their
indifference to prestige, Advocates may ascend the career ladder to
mentor and support their colleagues. For people with this personality
type, professional growth is most rewarding when it promotes their
ideals and enables them to make a difference in others' lives. These
ideals can take on abstract forms as well. Advocates are often drawn to
creative pursuits, such as writing, music, and art, which allow them to
explore deeper themes of personal growth, morality, and spirituality.
Through such endeavors, they can share their worldviews in a positive,
proactive fashion, enriching the lives of their audience.

Jobs and Skill Sets for Advocates Advocates do their best work in
positions that combine creativity with compassion. What follows isn't a
firm prescription as to what they must do to be successful or happy.
Rather, we hope it provides some decision-making insight. Perhaps the
most important question for them to ask when searching for a career
isn't, "What do I want to do for a living?" but rather, "How can I
pursue purpose and meaning?"

Health Care Counseling, psychology, and medicine speak to two of
Advocates' primary motivators: service and purpose. In these fields,
they enjoy helping others improve their minds and bodies. The
professions also exercise Advocates' creativity, requiring them to
synthesize information and insights as they determine how to best help
their patients. These jobs also suit Advocates' Introverted nature,
allowing them to work with patients individually and then step away to
ponder the experiences. Although medical TV dramas don't depict it,
these careers are about more than time spent with patients. Researching,
writing notes, and filling in charts are equally necessary for these
positions, which allows Advocates time to reflect in solitude. Here are
a few specific healthcare careers that are a good fit for Advocates'
skills and preferences: •

Growth and learning are central to Advocates' worldview, so working with
students suits them well. Imaginative and curious, they connect with
younger students using their intuition and empathy. With older students,
they present their subjects with unique passion, particularly the
humanities. Advocates tend to treat their students as individuals with
specific traits and needs. Looking beyond test scores and conventional
metrics of success, they glimpse the unique potential of each student.
Even though these types may feel taxed by constant contact with pupils
and colleagues throughout the day, they nevertheless believe they're
changing lives for the better. Advocates rarely seek leadership roles,
but they are likely to make good administrators. In general, they do
better as visionary leaders rather than ruleenforcers and paper-pushers.
Given the right administrative opportunities, Advocates may enact
reforms that improve the academic environment and boost students'
morale. Here are a few positions in the field of education that will
likely suit Advocates well:

human behavior, and this combination of traits makes them potent agents
of change. By combining thoughtful deliberation with grand vision, they

Career Alternatives We live in an age of possibilities, where putting in
time at a corporation isn't the only way to earn money. Advocates are
imaginative and bold, and their ability to identify and empathize with
people's needs enables them to add value beyond the confines of
conventional employment. Self-Employment Advocates value
self-determination and independence, so working for themselves is a
natural fit. Self-employed people can thrive in a range of fields,
including "The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

217

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

photography, graphic design, freelance writing, information technology
(IT), and website design. To identify suitable opportunities, Advocates
should consider the talents and interests they bring to their hobbies
and passion projects. Although no job is perfect, self-employed
individuals create their positions through passion and reinvention.
Their work is dictated more by personal choice than by a manager's
imperatives. When they channel their interests in a way that truly
benefits their clients, they experience the true rewards of their ideas
and efforts. Creative, principled, and mission-driven, Advocates can
derive great satisfaction from these aspects of self-employment.
Professional Volunteerism Supported by minor income from other
endeavors, some Advocates devote themselves to matters of conscience and
progress. Although unlikely to lead to financial prosperity, this path
may offer unparalleled personal satisfaction and growth. Some Advocates
transition into volunteerism later in life, providing wisdom and vigor
as well as expertise from previous occupations. Advocates with
specialized training -- from welders and carpenters to teachers and
doctors -- can be a blessing in underserved communities. Whatever their
work experience, they can join nonprofit organizations, found their own
groups, and even act individually. Almost anyone with warmth, patience,
and a high school education can tutor younger children, making an
incredible difference in their lives and futures. By following such a
path, Advocates satisfy their desire to foster harmony and healing in
the world. They can dip their toe in while keeping a day job, or plunge
in and devote their time to helping others without the distraction of a
profit motive.

harmony, positivity, and progress in their work environments.

Advocate--Analyst Cooperation

Like Advocates, Analysts thrive on big-picture visions and bold
creativity. Imaginative, abstract thinkers, they spot strange patterns
and generate wholly unexpected new ideas. Together, these two types can
combine their imaginative firepower to hatch big plans and tackle major
challenges. When an organization needs an injection of fresh ideas, they
can look to Advocates and Analysts as a brainstorming dynamo. Together,
these two personalities create a feedback loop of constant improvement,
ushering in novelty and catalyzing change.

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

Balanced Advocate--Analyst Cooperation Big-Picture Creativity They're
not blinded by the status quo, so Advocates and Analysts spot potential
where others might not see it, seizing opportunities that no one else
even recognizes. They also balance each other's strengths well, with
Analysts focusing on systems and rationality and Advocates attending to
human thought and emotion. As collaborators, these two types can venture
into entirely new territory, tackling problems previously deemed
unsolvable. Rational Counterbalance Advocates' altruistic instincts are
wonderful but at times impractical. Compared to Advocates, Analysts tend
to be more comfortable with the impersonal world of systems and puzzles,
allowing them to optimize and streamline processes. As a result,
ever-rational Analysts can help ensure that Advocates' efforts aren't
only well intended, but also feasible and sustainable. Advocates can
turn to Analysts when they need people to evaluate or improve the
viability of their ideas. Given their candor and incisiveness, Analysts
are likely to diagnose Advocates' blind spots and emotional biases, then
suggest course corrections and strategy enhancements that make
Advocates' initiatives feasible in the long run.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

Unbalanced Advocate--Analyst Cooperation Ivory Towers When Advocates and
Analysts work well together, they enjoy a sort of intellectual head
rush. For these two types, the joy of finally finding conversation
partners who banter about big concepts and abstract ideas is powerful.
If this devolves into cliquishness, however, they may wall themselves
off from other colleagues, closing their ears to alternative viewpoints
and worldviews. Although Advocates and Analysts counterbalance some of
each other's weaknesses, their similarities leave them susceptible to
blind spots. These two types may overlook nitty-gritty details -- and
implementation isn't among their strong points. As a result, when they
make plans without consulting more pragmatic colleagues, they may set
themselves up to fail, whether by neglecting practical details or by
creating incredible visions without the ability to implement them.
Values vs. Logic When it prioritizes optimization over compassion,
Analysts' hardline rationality can dismay Advocates. Meanwhile,
Advocates who honor their values of harmony and cooperation may find
that Analysts accuse them of being too soft or over-emotional. When
their working relationships fall into this pattern, Advocates and
Analysts may become locked into debate over their different approaches.
These debates can veer into pedantic, unproductive territory, preventing
the colleagues from addressing other issues and tasks. If they work too
hard to prove themselves right instead of arriving at a solution, their
hostility and refusal to communicate may dampen overall workplace morale
and productivity. Other

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

colleagues may even dismiss Advocates and Analysts as impractical or
inefficient for spending so much time and energy on their philosophical
disagreements. Over time, Advocates' aversion to open conflict may cause
them to disengage entirely from these debates. Although they may no
longer argue, they're likely to be seething internally, seeing their
Analyst colleagues as imperious and insensitive. Points of contention
can't be resolved without open discussion, so when they disengage in
this manner, Advocates worsen the working relationship, reducing their
chances of making progress.

Rebalancing Advocate--Analyst Cooperation Asking Why By asking
thoughtful questions, Advocates can break stalemates with Analyst
colleagues. Analysts tend to be pleasantly surprised when people are
curious enough to ask them to explain their opinions or comments. In
this context, they don't mind being challenged a bit, provided it
enhances the discussion. This gives Advocates the opportunity to make a
counterargument or offer their own analysis. To initiate civil,
worthwhile conversations with Analysts, the key is to ask for additional
details through "why," "how," and "what" questions -- for example, "Why
do you recommend that course of action?" or "What do you think needs to
change?" These queries prompt the type of intellectual engagement
Analysts respect. Loaded or rhetorical questions -- such as, "Do you
have any idea how this would affect our client base?" -- are unhelpful
and should be avoided. Remember, Analysts' interest in optimization and
effectiveness may be one-sided, but it's valid, so try the following
steps:

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

222

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

•

Ask Analysts thoughtful questions about their motivations and rationale.
Don't hesitate to ask for clarification.

•

Avoid loaded or rhetorical questions.

•

Stick to "why," "how," and "what" questions that demonstrate real
curiosity.

•

Listen honestly and patiently to their responses, considering the
reasoning behind Analysts' perspectives.

Intellectual engagement is a hallmark of positive Advocate--Analyst
communication. By asking thoughtful questions, Advocates can ease
tensions and create the momentum to move forward. Inquiring and
Explaining Unlike Analysts, Advocates crave discussions about "who," not
just "why" or "how." By asking questions that steer conversations in
this direction, they can help their Analyst colleagues understand how
best to communicate with them. For example, Advocates might say, "Who
will benefit from your proposed changes?" to encourage Analysts to
consider some of the human ramifications of their ideas. Like Advocates,
Analysts care about improvements and positive change, and they
appreciate when Advocates explain the conditions under which they work
best. Analysts don't excel in terms of emotional intelligence, and
they're certainly not mind readers. By explaining what makes them tick,
Advocates give their Analyst colleagues the tools to improve the
relationship and facilitate productive collaboration. Try the following:
•

Directly and respectfully explain that human considerations are simply
an important component in the situation, so it makes sense to take them
into account.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

223

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

•

Steer the conversation toward social dynamics or interpersonal concerns
by asking questions that show the utility and necessity of exploring
this terrain. This can promote the style of big-picture collaboration
that Analysts and Advocates do best.

•

Grant Analyst colleagues the same consideration when they steer a
conversation toward systems or analysis.

•

Make requests or suggestions by emphasizing that a constructive working
environment is necessary to generate improvement and positive impact.

Advocates can help Analysts to see to the usefulness of considering the
human impact of their decisions. In doing so, they can create common
ground with even the most optimization-oriented of Analysts.

Advocate--Diplomat Cooperation

Advocates and other Diplomats have the advantage of speaking the same
language. For them, purpose matters more than profit, and they aim to
better society and improve lives through their work. Because they're so
often accused of idealism and

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

224

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

impracticality, Advocates and Diplomats delight in finding others who
are as valuesdriven as they are.

Balanced Advocate--Diplomat Cooperation Visionaries with Purpose
Together, Advocates and other Diplomats can foster harmony and growth
within an organization. They excel at creating new initiatives,
particularly those with qualitative rather than quantitative upsides.
They might envision campaigns to improve customer loyalty, bolster
employee morale, or rebrand an organization in a fresh and more
approachable way. These types also believe in helping their colleagues
reach their full potential, which can breathe new life into their
workplace. Although their contributions might not immediately boost the
bottom line, Advocates and Diplomats act in ways that benefit
organizations -- and the people they serve -- in the long run. Change
Agents These types may seem to be all talk and no action, but this isn't
the case. When necessary, they translate their big ideas into bold steps
to make their dreams of a better world into reality. In the workplace,
they feed off each other's sense of mission and purpose, which
strengthens their resolve and gives them the motivation to tackle major
challenges -- particularly those that result in quality-of-life
improvements for their customers or coworkers. If they find themselves
in an organization that sacrifices people's well-being in favor of
profit or productivity, these two types won't hesitate to work toward
reform, whether in the form of fair compensation or stricter
environmental standards. They

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

225

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

advocate for others, acting from an essential belief in the goodness and
dignity of their customers and colleagues. If they work in the corporate
division of a retail chain, they might strive to offer better value to
customers and better benefits to store employees. Although it may put
them at odds with their managers, this mindset creates an organizational
culture infused with meaning and purpose -- exactly the type of culture
toward which many consumers and potential employees gravitate.

Unbalanced Advocate--Diplomat Cooperation Too Much of a Good Thing
Advocates and other Diplomats may become stuck in their world of values
and ideals, inadvertently excluding the insights of those who think
differently. If these two types isolate themselves, they can create a
high-minded or even self-righteous echo chamber, dismissing other
personality types' pragmatic insights as narrow-minded or boring.
Carrying out visions -- or turning a profit to make their efforts
sustainable -- may not be their common strong point, and unheard
coworkers may feel frustrated, hurt, or ignored. Without a concrete
"how-to" strategy, inattention to day-to-day details like budgets,
timelines, project management, and necessary compromises can derail
their visions for change. Unless Advocates and Diplomats recruit other
personality types -- and value their advice -- they may generate
beautiful mission statements and grand plans that go nowhere. Hard
Decisions These types love to spot potential and stick to their ideals,
but this can make them shy away from painful but necessary decisions.
Even if they rationally recognize the

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

226

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

need to slash budgets or fire employees, they may hesitate, imagining
and reimagining the potential repercussions for the people affected. If
taken too far, the desire to find an ideal course of action that
benefits absolutely everyone can spiral into inaction and denial.
Together, Advocates and Diplomats may fixate so much on the silver
lining of a bad situation, or the possible ramifications of a hard
decision, that they don't work to fix things. By avoiding difficult but
necessary decisions, they may avoid short-term discomfort, but they will
also undercut their long-term chances of success.

Rebalancing Advocate--Diplomat Cooperation Opening the Doors The
Diplomat Role group contains many of the rarest personality types. When
they work together, the thrill of finally finding kindred spirits may
make them cliquish or insular. They can build upon their shared
strengths, but they may be left with no one to counterbalance their
weaknesses. Instead, they can draw on their natural inclusivity and
innate interest in other people to forge connections, inviting various
colleagues to share their perspectives. Pragmatic Sentinels, rational
Analysts, and in-the-moment Explorers may spot solutions that don't
occur to Advocates and their fellow Diplomats. To facilitate this
exchange, Advocates can set up meetings or informal chats to run their
ideas past colleagues with different thinking styles. This is vital in
the early stages of a project, when ideas are still malleable and
changes in direction are still easy. Advocates should also seek others'
opinions whenever they feel stalled. Just as it's natural for people
with this personality type to struggle with difficult decisions,

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

227

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

Sentinels excel at finding practical solutions, Analysts promote
efficacy, and Explorers take quick action. These traits can all help
Advocates and fellow Diplomats break free of inaction and denial. Ways
to go about this include: •

Set up group brainstorming sessions with a range of personality types to
receive early feedback on new ideas.

•

Ask a range of colleagues for feedback on action plans and in-progress
projects.

•

Consult colleagues with different thinking styles in the face of
difficult, seemingly intractable decisions.

•

After projects are completed, set up meetings or informal conversations
to discuss what went well and what could be improved in the future.

These strategies can help Advocates' non-Diplomat colleagues feel
included and heard, and they also can create a working environment that
benefits from a diversity of perspectives. Speaking the Truth Advocates
generally avoid open conflict, which can lead them to harbor resentments
that boil over. This may manifest as stonewalling, judgment, or
avoidance. Alas, sensitive Diplomats struggle to function in tense,
unsupportive environments. When they sense Advocates' disapproval, they
may drop everything to please or appease these colleagues, even if there
are more pressing matters to attend to. Although it runs counter to
their nature and may lead to hurt feelings in the short term, Advocates
must discuss any frustrations kindly but openly with Diplomat
colleagues. Only when issues are addressed and resolved can Diplomats
get back to focusing on their work. To air conflicts promptly and create
environments where

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

228

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

both types speak up and collaborate, maximizing their ability to make
valuable contributions, keep these hints in mind: •

In charged situations, settle any emotional energy and return to
equilibrium before offering feedback to Diplomats. Try to address issues
after the emotional rush has passed, but before situations have a chance
to repeat themselves.

•

Air frustrations in an open, constructive manner. Make "I" statements --
for example, "I felt upset when I saw this work hadn't been done" --
rather than judgments or accusations.

It will challenge both types, but Advocates and Diplomats alike should
speak their feelings rather than harbor resentments. By bringing issues
to the surface, they and their colleagues can set things right,
establish mutual understanding, and move on.

Advocate--Sentinel Cooperation

Like Advocates, Sentinels find energy and self-respect in helping
others. This shared commitment to service and integrity helps these two
disparate types find common

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

229

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

ground. Although Sentinels are pragmatic, they aren't ruthless, and
Advocates can count them as allies in doing what's right. As a team,
these two types can reform organizations, boost employee morale, and
encourage honesty and dedication in their coworkers.

Balanced Advocate--Sentinel Cooperation Caring and Integrity Although
Advocates are ideologically driven and Sentinels tend to be more
practical and concrete, their underlying goals are often in alignment.
Together, they tend to ensure that the principle of fairness is upheld
by concrete actions and enduring changes. Taking the Devil out of the
Details Advocates love big ideas -- sometimes at the expense of small
but essential details. This is where Sentinels stand out as excellent
collaborators, keeping an eye on dayto-day operations, ensuring that
things run smoothly, and anticipating practical challenges. When a
budget needs to be upheld, or a project timeline needs to be enforced,
there are few better allies than Sentinels. When they want to try
something new, Advocates can turn to Sentinels for a grounded point of
view. Sentinels have practical savvy, and they know what's worked in the
past and what hasn't. Advocates might be tempted to dismiss them as
stodgy, but Sentinels' insights can save precious time and energy,
particularly in the early stages of a project. In workplace
partnerships, Advocates and Sentinels counterbalance each other
beautifully, combining idealism with know-how, vision with practicality.
The result is likely to be new initiatives that get implemented.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

230

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

Unbalanced Advocate-Sentinel Cooperation Broken Communication Advocates
think in terms of grand abstractions -- such as purpose, truth, and
beauty -- and this can lead to miscommunications with concrete-minded
Sentinels. When Sentinels push for short-term specifics rather than
long-term visions, Advocates might judge them as small-minded or
unimaginative. In turn, Advocates may find themselves labeled
impractical or ineffective. In unbalanced relationships, Advocates lose
respect for Sentinels' opinions, so they don't consult Sentinels
regarding new ideas. As a result, they lose the benefit of Sentinels'
diligent, detail-oriented approach. Although Advocates may think they're
better off without Sentinels' input, their unwillingness to collaborate
with these colleagues can cause frustration and headaches when it's time
to implement or troubleshoot projects -- two areas where Sentinels
excel. Disparate Values Advocates share some values with Sentinels --
such as loyalty -- but they certainly don't agree on all counts.
Compared to Advocates, Sentinels are more invested in proven methods and
protocols. They think more about what works than about what might work,
something that can frustrate progress-oriented Advocates. In the
workplace, this often manifests as disagreements over the best ways to
do things, with Sentinels leaning on historically successful protocols
and Advocates pushing for new ideas and advancements. This can be
especially apparent in the way these types evaluate their coworkers. In
colleagues and potential new hires, Advocates appreciate intangible
qualities like

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

231

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

thoughtfulness and vision, regardless of proven skills or track records.
Meanwhile, Sentinels look to past performance and seniority to assess
team members. These differing priorities may create tension when
Advocates and Sentinels need to cooperate for hiring, teambuilding, or
assessing employee performance.

Rebalancing Advocate--Sentinel Cooperation Talking Specifics When
Sentinels ask for clarifying details, Advocates might see them as
narrowminded or unimaginative. For them, lofty concepts and goals should
transcend workaday, practical metrics. Sentinels' interest in specifics
is perfectly valid, however, and by honoring it, Advocates can create
stronger, more fruitful working relationships. To communicate
effectively with Sentinels, Advocates can ground their use of abstract
terms like "vision," "community," or even "service" with concrete
details. This might entail outlining specific benchmarks they'd like to
hit as opposed to reciting a mission statement, or discussing the
tangible upsides of a new approach rather than the intangible benefits.
At times, Advocates won't realize that they're vague or unclear, so they
can benefit from asking their colleagues for feedback: •

Ask Sentinels to ground a qualitative vision or goal, such as improved
customer loyalty or employee satisfaction, in concrete details. How can
the goal be measured? Is it sufficiently precise? What actions can be
taken to achieve it?

•

Regularly ask Sentinel colleagues for advice on how to translate ideas
into concrete terms, as this is their strong suit. Solicit feedback
regarding which aspects of a plan should be more specific or actionable.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

232

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

•

When suggesting a change, support the argument by outlining tangible
benefits. Intangible and theoretical aspects concern Sentinels less than
the known and predictable details

By bridging the gap between their big ideas and specific goals,
Advocates can win over Sentinels and pave the way for clear
communication. Showing Appreciation and Respect Sentinels tend to put
considerable time and energy into their work. Although they rarely ask
for praise, they feel motivated and energized when they receive it. By
expressing appreciation for Sentinels' contributions, Advocates can help
their colleagues feel seen and respected, paving the way for positive,
productive relationships. The best compliments are genuine, not forced,
so Advocates should offer praise only when moved to do so. Whether an
informal email, a quick chat, or a verbal thankyou at a group meeting,
the goal is to acknowledge Sentinels' specific contributions and explain
what makes these contributions praiseworthy. Consider the following tips
for effective communication: •

Don't force compliments. Offer genuine appreciation so that feedback
always matters.

•

Praise specific actions and explain why. Be as detailed as possible.

•

Acknowledge Sentinels via quick thank-you emails whenever they're
especially helpful.

•

When appropriate, thank Sentinels in front of others.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

233

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

These gestures allow Advocates to not only offer encouragement, but also
communicate in the specific terms that Sentinels appreciate.

Advocate--Explorer Cooperation

Like Advocates, Explorers love to move forward with tasks and explore
novel solutions. Although they prefer nitty-gritty problems to
Advocates' grand challenges, both types value independence and discovery
over rules and tradition. They especially enjoy turning a fixed idea on
its head, creating a whole new perspective. This common ground enables
Advocates and Explorers to work together as innovators.

Balanced Advocate--Explorer Cooperation New Solutions Advocates can turn
to Explorers whenever they need to break new ground, whether that means
revamping an organization's culture, opening a store location, or
branching into a different market. Explorers are more comfortable with
risk than

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

234

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

Advocates, and they may help Advocates move past their cautious natures
to spot and pursue new opportunities. Complementary Strengths Advocates
often find that Explorers' strengths complement their own. Although
Advocates excel at grasping, creating, and transforming ideas, they live
in their heads, and they sometimes struggle to fit such big ideas into
such a small world. Explorers, who are masters of hands-on execution and
on-the-fly troubleshooting, can tackle boring details as well as the
fraught, time-sensitive situations that make Advocates cringe. Together,
these two types can generate new ideas and execute them. Let's say that
Advocates, who excel at spotting high-level problems, realize their
company isn't perceived as approachable or accessible. Their Explorer
colleagues might address this realization by starting email newsletters,
creating behind-the-scenes videos, or launching interactive social-media
strategies. In such relationships, Advocates can lean on their true
strengths -- including pattern recognition and idea generation -- and
then entrust the implementation to Explorers.

Unbalanced Advocate--Explorer Cooperation Values vs. Utility Although
established standards don't bind Explorers or Advocates as tightly as
they might Sentinels, Advocates do live by a code. Their values,
including thoughtfulness and compassion, are active forces in their
lives, as real as any action. Explorers have values of their own, but
they focus more on utilitarian solutions than ideals, which influences
the way they handle business.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

235

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

For instance, Explorers might bolster sales by mining their personal
networks or using client lists from previous employers -- activities
that would probably challenge Advocates' sense of integrity. In such
situations, Advocates may stonewall or criticize their Explorer
colleagues, refusing to collaborate or even communicate. By writing off
colleagues in this manner, Advocates narrow the circle of people whom
they can count as allies. This is rarely a wise decision, as Explorers'
enthusiasm and resourcefulness may make all the difference in bringing
projects to fruition. Now or Later In stark contrast to Advocates,
Explorers often downplay consequences. Given a choice between a bird in
the hand or two in the bush, Advocates might well choose the two in the
bush. Explorers, on the other hand, tend to shy away from long-term
planning and prioritize immediate gains. In the workplace, this can
manifest as priority misalignment. Advocates tend to focus on building
lasting relationships with clients and upholding mission statements,
whereas Explorers likely favor near-term profits and risky ventures with
big payoffs. If communication breaks down, Advocates may judge their
Explorer colleagues as shortsighted or trigger-happy. Meanwhile,
Explorers may dismiss Advocates as impractical or uptight. If they don't
collaborate, Advocates can miss out on exciting opportunities, and
Explorers may lose sight of the big picture.

Rebalancing Advocate--Explorer Cooperation Exciting and Actionable
Although Explorers like new ideas, they aren't as likely to be fulfilled
by conceptual discussions as Advocates are. To connect with Explorers,
Advocates should set aside

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

236

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

philosophical debates and instead explain what makes an idea interesting
or exciting. They may highlight the novelty of initiatives or some
intriguing challenges that might arise -- two surefire ways to capture
Explorers' attention. Explorers also respond well when Advocates
communicate in terms of action steps, not just high-level abstractions.
Rather than declaring a commitment to environmental sustainability,
Advocates might suggest specific behaviors, such as recycling, emailing
rather than printing memos, or stocking the kitchenette with reusable
mugs rather than paper cups. Try the following specifics to elicit
Explorers' creativity: •

Highlight what makes an idea or initiative exciting, distinctive, or
intriguing.

•

Communicate large-scale ideas via specific actions, behaviors, and
goals.

•

Limit philosophical discussions, or at least ground them in concrete
details.

•

Ask Explorers for input. They excel at identifying -- and taking -- the
next steps to move projects forward.

Explorers' most pronounced strengths include curiosity, openness, and
spontaneity. By communicating the novel, exciting aspects of an idea and
connecting concepts to action, Advocates can capture the attention and
commitment of these valuable team members. Open Communication In
unbalanced working relationships with Explorers, Advocates may choose to
withdraw instead of openly addressing differences of opinions. This
stonewalling comes at a cost, however. Beyond generating a surprising
amount of drama, it curtails any chance of collaboration.

"The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

237

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

To revive communication, Advocates can treat Explorers the way they
would wish to be treated. This means soliciting Explorers' opinions and
acknowledging their contributions and strengths, such as troubleshooting
problems, mastering new techniques, and getting things done. This also
entails expressing genuine curiosity about what Explorers hope to
achieve and how they plan to achieve it. The following steps may help
these disparate types find common ground: •

Reopen communication by asking Explorers for their input and
acknowledging their work.

•

Focus on listening, learning, and asking questions rather than debating
or being right.

•

Express curiosity about their definitions of success.

Resourceful and tenacious, Explorers care about getting things done and
moving projects forward. If they practice open, respectful
communication, Advocates often come to respect and admire the proactive,
fearless spirits that their Explorer colleagues bring to the workplace.

Conclusion Advocates' strengths -- including creativity, dedication, and
insight -- are invaluable in many workplaces. To achieve job
satisfaction, however, they must seek out positions that suit their
personalities. This often entails pushing beyond their comfort zones,
acclimating themselves to risk, and creating mission statements to
maintain the motivation needed to reach their full potential. When
interacting with coworkers, Advocates must balance their principles and
their desire for independence with the necessities of collaboration,
communication, and "The Advocate" (INFJ, -A/-T)

238

Advocates' Career and Professional Development

openness to other mindsets. This can be achieved by taking alone time,
setting boundaries, and soliciting the opinions of people who think
differently. By taking the time to find both the right field and the
right workplace, Advocates may carry the resulting sense of meaning and
purpose into every aspect of their lives.
