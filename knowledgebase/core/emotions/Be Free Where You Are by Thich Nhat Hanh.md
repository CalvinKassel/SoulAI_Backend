***Foreword***
:::

::: fmtx1
I accompanied Thây Thich Nhat Hanh to the Maryland Correctional
Institution at Hagerstown on October 16th, 1999, along with Pritam
Singh, Brother William, and many other friends. In order for us to join
the more than one hundred inmates that were waiting for us in the
chapel, we had to pass through sixteen checkpoints. At one gate, a
security guard confiscated a small tape recorder that I was carrying
with me to record Thây's talk. I stubbornly objected to his taking it
from me, explaining to him that our teacher was getting old and I did
not want to lose any of his Dharma talks. After a half an hour, he
returned the recorder to me and we continued on. As it turns out, the
correctional institution's recorder was not working, and it is thanks to
my small tape recorder that this book, a transcription of the talk he
gave to the inmates that day, is being made available to you.
:::

::: fmtx
During his talk, one of the things Thây
<?dp n="8" folio="viii" ?>
explained to the inmates was how to eat mindfully and joyfully in the
present moment, with awareness of everyone and everything around us.
When lunchtime came and we all sat down together, I was surprised to see
that our inmate friends, even after hearing Thây's talk, still ate their
food so quickly. Their habit energy was very strong. We had barely
finished setting out the food for Thây when most of them had already
finished their lunch! At first, I feared that they would not understand
Thây's teaching about mindful eating. However, as we started to eat, our
inmate friends began to watch us as we mindfully enjoyed our food. They
could see the joy and mindfulness with which Thây picked up each morsel
of food, as well as the friendly looks that we gave them from time to
time. I hoped that after having had a chance to witness Thây embody his
teaching while he ate, they too might enjoy eating more mindfully in the
future.
:::

::: fmtx
Later that day, an inmate who had spent
<?dp n="9" folio="ix" ?>
thirty years in jail asked me what he could do to bring joy and peace
into the world. Looking into his eyes, I could see that he was very
sincere.
:::

::: fmtx
I turned to him and smiled. "One of the best things that you could offer
to the people around you," I said, "is your way of being. You do not
need to have money in your pocket or wait until you are out of jail to
do something for the world. If you can practice dwelling peacefully in
the present moment during the day, being mindful of whatever it is that
you are doing, peace will radiate from you, and this will inspire the
people around you.
:::

::: fmtx
"Perhaps there is an inmate or a guard who acts aggressively towards
you. If you can look with compassion at him---with kindness and
love---and offer him a gentle smile, he will be receiving something very
precious from you. When you understand the pain of those who cause you
suffering and choose to let it go, forgiveness will come naturally,
because compassion will be
<?dp n="10" folio="x" ?>
present. When it is necessary, you can be firm and strong, but never
lose your kindness or your beauty."
:::

::: fmtx
I knew that doing this would not be easy for him without a Sangha, so I
suggested: "Why don't you form a small Sangha here? You can start by
gathering two or three friends to discuss the practice that Thây has
taught you today. Is it possible to do that during the religious service
time?"
:::

::: fmtx
My friend's eyes grew brighter as he listened. "It will not be as easy
as it sounds," he replied, "but I think it can be done."
:::

::: fmtx
Throughout the day the inmates showed a lot of interest in Thây's talk
and asked many questions. I am quite sure the teachings and answers
given to prisoners can be applied to any one of us---inside or outside
the prison walls.

***For Warmth***

Dear Friends, I wrote the following poem during the war in Vietnam after
the town of Ben Tre was bombed by the United States Air Force. Ben Tre
is the hometown of my colleague, Sister Chân Không. The U.S. forces
destroyed the entire town because there were five or six guerrillas
there. Later on, one officer declared that he had to bomb and destroy
Ben Tre to save it from Communism. This poem is about anger.

I was very angry. It was not just my anger, but the anger of a whole
nation. Anger is a kind of energy that makes us and the people around us
suffer. As a monk, when I get angry, I practice caring for my anger. I
don't allow it to cause suffering or to destroy me. If you take care of
your anger and are able to find relief, you will be able to live happily
with much joy.

***The Energy of Liberation***
:::

::: tx1
To take care of my anger I bring my attention to my breathing and look
deeply inside myself. Right away I notice an energy there called anger.
Then I recognize that I need another kind of energy to take care of this
anger, and I invite that energy to come up to do that job. This second
energy is called mindfulness. Every one of us has the seed of
mindfulness within us. If we know how to touch that seed, we can begin
to generate the energy of mindfulness, and with that energy,
<?dp n="15" folio="3" ?>
we can take good care of the energy of anger.
:::

::: tx
Mindfulness is a kind of energy that helps us to be aware of what is
going on. Everyone is capable of being mindful. Those of us who practice
daily have a greater capacity for being mindful than those who do not.
Those who do not practice still have the seed of mindfulness, but its
energy is very weak. By practicing just three days, the energy of
mindfulness will already increase.
:::

::: tx
There can be mindfulness in anything you do. While you are drinking a
cup of water, if you know that you are drinking water in that moment and
you are not thinking of anything else, you are drinking mindfully. If
you focus your whole being, body and mind, on the water, there is
mindfulness and concentration, and the act of drinking may be described
as mindful drinking. You drink not only with your mouth, but with your
body and your consciousness, too. Everyone is capable of drinking his or
her water mindfully. This is the way I was trained as a novice.
:::

<?dp n="16" folio="4" ?>

::: tx
Walking mindfully is possible anywhere you are. When you walk, focus all
your attention on the act of walking. Become aware of every step you
take and don't think of anything else. This is called mindful walking.
It is wonderfully effective. By doing this, you will begin to walk in
such a way that every step brings you solidity, freedom, and dignity.
You are the master of your own self.
:::

::: tx
Anytime I have to go from one place to another, I practice walking
meditation---even if the distance is only five or six feet. Climbing up
the stairs, I practice walking meditation. Going down the stairs, I
practice walking meditation. Boarding an airplane, I practice walking
meditation. Going from my room to the toilet, I practice walking
meditation. Going to the kitchen, I practice walking meditation. I do
not have any other style of walking---just mindful walking. It helps me
very much. It brings me transformation, healing, and joy.
:::

::: tx
When you eat, you can practice mindfulness. Mindful eating can bring you
a lot
<?dp n="17" folio="5" ?>
of joy and happiness. In my tradition, eating is a deep practice. First,
we sit in a stable position and look at the food. Then, mindfully, we
smile at it. We see the food as an ambassador that has come to us from
the sky and from the Earth. Looking at a string bean, I can see a cloud
floating in it. I can see the rain and the sunshine. I realize that this
string bean is a part of the Earth and the sky.
:::

::: tx
When I bite into the string bean, I am aware that this is a string bean
that I have put into my mouth. There is nothing else in my mouth---not
my sorrow or my fear. When I chew the string bean, I am just chewing a
string bean---not my worries or my anger. I chew very carefully, with
one hundred percent of myself. I feel a connection to the sky, the
Earth, the farmers who grow the food, and the people who cook it. Eating
like this, I feel that solidity, freedom, and joy are possible. The meal
not only nourishes my body, but also my soul, my consciousness, and my
spirit.

***Cultivating Freedom***
:::

::: tx1
For me, there is no happiness without freedom, and freedom is not given
to us by anyone; we have to cultivate it ourselves. I will share with
you how we get greater freedom for ourselves. During the time that we
sit, walk, eat, or work outside, we cultivate our freedom. Freedom is
what we practice every day.
:::

::: tx
No matter how or where you find yourself, if you have freedom, you are
happy. I have many friends who spent time in forced labor camps and
because they knew how to practice, they did not suffer as greatly. In
fact, they grew in their spiritual lives, for which I am very proud of
them.
:::

::: tx
By freedom I mean freedom from afflictions, from anger, and from
despair. If you have anger in you, you have to transform anger in order
to get your freedom back. If there is despair in you, you need to
recognize that energy and not allow it to overwhelm you. You have to
practice in such a
<?dp n="19" folio="7" ?>
way that you transform the energy of despair and attain the freedom you
deserve ---the freedom from despair.
:::

::: tx
You can practice freedom every moment of your daily life. Every step you
take can help you reclaim your freedom. Every breath you take can help
you develop and cultivate your freedom. When you eat, eat as a free
person. When you walk, walk as a free person. When you breathe, breathe
as a free person. This is possible anywhere.
:::

::: tx
By cultivating freedom for yourself, you will be able to help the people
you live with. Even though you live in the same place, with the same
physical and material conditions, if you practice, you will be a much
freer person, a more solid person. Watching the way you walk, the way
you sit, and the way you eat, people will be impressed. They will see
that joy and happiness are possible for you, and will want to be like
you because you are your own master, no longer a victim of anger,
frustration, and despair. The practice that I have taken up as a
Buddhist
<?dp n="20" folio="8" ?>
monk is the practice of freedom. When I became a novice, my teacher gave
me a little book entitled *Stepping into Freedom: A Manual for a Novice
Monk.*
:::

::: tx
To be able to breathe in and out is a miracle. A person on his or her
deathbed cannot breathe freely, and he or she will soon stop breathing
altogether. But I am alive. I can breathe in and become aware of my
in-breath; I can breathe out and become aware of my out-breath. I smile
at my out-breath and am aware that I am alive. So when you breathe in,
be aware of your in-breath. "Breathing in, I know this is my in-breath."
No one can prevent you from enjoying your in-breath. When you breathe
out, be aware that this is your out-breath. Breathe as a free person.
:::

::: tx
For me, to be alive is a miracle. It is the greatest of all miracles. To
feel that you are alive and are breathing in is to perform a
miracle---one that you can perform at any time. Feeling that you are
alive and that you are taking a step is a miracle. Master Linchi, a
<?dp n="21" folio="9" ?>
well-known meditation teacher who lived in the ninth century, said that
the miracle is not walking on water but walking on the Earth.
:::

::: tx
Everyone walks on the Earth, but there are those who walk like slaves,
with no freedom at all. They are sucked in by the future or by the past,
and they are not capable of dwelling in the here and now, where life is
available. If we get caught up in our worries, our despair, our regrets
about the past, and our fears of the future in our everyday lives, we
are not free people. We are not capable of establishing ourselves in the
here and now.

***Touching Miracles***
:::

::: tx1
According to the Buddha, my teacher, life is only available in the here
and now. The past is already gone, and the future is yet to come. There
is only one moment for me to live---the present moment. So the first
thing I do is to go back to the present
<?dp n="22" folio="10" ?>
moment. By doing so, I touch life deeply. My in-breath is life, my
out-breath is life. Each step I take is life. The air I breathe is life.
I can touch the blue sky and the vegetation. I can hear the sound of the
birds and the sound of another human being. If we can return to the here
and now, we will be able to touch the many wonders of life that are
available.
:::

::: tx
Many of us think that happiness is not possible in the present moment.
Most of us believe that there are a few more conditions that need to be
met before we can be happy. This is why we are sucked into the future
and are not capable of being present in the here and now. This is why we
step over many of the wonders of life. If we keep running away into the
future, we cannot be in touch with the many wonders of life---we cannot
be in the present moment where there is healing, transformation, and
joy.

***You Are a Miracle***
:::

::: tx1
When I eat an orange, I can eat the orange as an act of meditation.
Holding the orange in the palm of my hand, I look at it mindfully. I
take a long time to look at the orange with mindfulness. "Breathing in,
there is an orange in my hand. Breathing out, I smile at the orange."
For me, an orange is nothing less than a miracle. When I look at an
orange in the here and now, I can see it with my spiritual eyes---the
orange blossom, the sunshine and the rain going through the blossoms,
the tiny green orange, and then the tree working over time to bring the
orange to its full size. I look at the orange in my hand and I smile. It
is nothing short of a miracle. Breathing in and out mindfully, I become
fully present and fully alive, and now I see myself as a miracle.
:::

::: tx
Dear friends, you are nothing less than a miracle. There may be times
when you feel that you are worthless. But you are nothing less than a
miracle. The fact that you are
<?dp n="24" folio="12" ?>
here---alive and capable of breathing in and out---is ample proof that
you are a miracle. One string bean contains the whole cosmos in it:
sunshine, rain, the whole Earth, time, space, and consciousness. You
also contain the whole cosmos.
:::

::: tx
We contain the Kingdom of God, the Pure Land of the Buddha, in every
cell of our bodies. If we know how to live, the Kingdom of God will
manifest for us in the here and now; with one step, we can penetrate it.
We don't have to die to enter the Kingdom of God; in fact, we have to be
very much alive. Hell, too, is in every cell of our body. It is up to us
to choose. If we keep watering the seed of Hell in us each day, then
Hell will be the reality we live in twenty-four hours a day. But if we
know how to water the seed of the Kingdom of God in us each day, then
the Kingdom of God will become the reality we live in every moment of
our daily lives. This is my experience.
:::

::: tx
There is not a day I do not walk in the Kingdom of God. Whether I am in
this
<?dp n="25" folio="13" ?>
place or somewhere else, I am always capable of walking mindfully, and
the ground beneath my feet is always the Pure Land of the Buddha. No one
can take that away from me. For me, the Kingdom of God is now or never.
It is not situated in time or space; it is in our hearts. You have to
develop mindful walking and touch the Earth as if it were a miracle. If
you know how to go back to the here and now, if you know how to touch
the Kingdom of God in every cell of your body, it will manifest to you
right away in the here and now.

***Freedom Is Possible Now***
:::

::: tx1
To touch the Kingdom of God, you need a little bit of training and a
friend---a brother or a sister whose own practice can help you. When we
see someone walking mindfully and enjoying every step he or she takes,
we are motivated to go back to ourselves and do the same. A prisoner
wrote to me in France
<?dp n="26" folio="14" ?>
saying that he had read my books and learned how to practice walking
meditation in prison. He said he always walks up and down the stairs
mindfully, and he enjoys every step he takes. Ever since he began this
practice, his life has become pleasant. When he sees other inmates
rushing up and down the stairs---with no stability or solidity, no calm
or joy---he wishes they could learn to do walking meditation like him
because every step he takes nourishes and transforms him.
:::

::: tx
Walk as a free person. Walk in such a way that every step brings you
more dignity, freedom, and stability. Then joy and compassion will be
born in your heart. You will realize that most other people do not walk
like this, that they are possessed by their anger, their fear, and their
despair. This may motivate you to help them learn how to live in the
present moment, how to sit and walk as a free person does. One person
sitting, walking, eating, and breathing as a free person can make an
impact on the
<?dp n="27" folio="15" ?>
whole environment around him.
:::

::: tx
When I first came to the West, I was already practicing mindfulness. My
purpose in coming here was to try to stop the destruction of human life
in my country. I was just one person at that time. Everywhere I went, I
practiced mindful walking and breathing, embodying the practice. As I
made friends here, more and more people joined with me to call for an
end to the atrocities being committed in Vietnam. Now I have tens of
thousands of friends who practice mindfulness all over the world. Those
who practice daily have been able to transform their lives and nourish
their compassion and forgiveness. By doing this, they have been able to
lessen the suffering of the people around them.

***Walk As a Free Person***
:::

::: tx1
This morning when I stepped into the prison compound, I walked very
mindfully. I
<?dp n="28" folio="16" ?>
noticed that the quality of the air was exactly like the quality of the
air outside. When I looked at the sky, I saw that it was exactly the
same as the sky outside. When I looked at the grass and the flowers,
they too looked the same as the grass and flowers outside. Each step I
took brought me the same kind of solidity and freedom that I experienced
outside. So there is nothing that can prevent us from practicing
successfully and bringing freedom and solidity to ourselves.
:::

::: tx
When you walk, breathe in; as you take two or three steps, call the name
of someone you love, someone who can bring you a feeling of freshness,
compassion, and love. With every step, call his or her name. Suppose I
call the name of David. When I breathe in, I take two steps and quietly
call, "David, David." When I call his name, David will be with me. I
walk with peace and freedom so that David can walk with peace and
freedom at the same time with me. When I breathe out, I take another two
steps and say, "Here I am, here I am." So
<?dp n="29" folio="17" ?>
not only is David there for me, but I am there for him at the same time.
"David, David. Here I am, here I am." I am entirely concentrated on the
acts of walking and breathing. My mind is not thinking about anything
else.

You can call to the Earth, "Earth, Earth. Here I am, here I am." The
Earth is our mother and is always there for us. She has produced us,
brought us to life; and she will receive us and bring us back again and
again, countless times. So when I call, "Earth," I call to my awareness
that is the ground of my being. "Here I am, here I am." If you practice
like this for a few weeks or months, you will begin to feel much better.
:::

::: tx
The practice is to get in touch with elements inside ourselves that are
wonderful, that refresh and heal us. Without mindfulness in our daily
life, we tend to allow in many elements that are harmful to our bodies
and our consciousnesses. The Buddha said that nothing can survive
without food. Our joy cannot survive without food; neither
<?dp n="30" folio="18" ?>
can our sorrow or our despair.
:::

::: tx
If we have despair, it is because we have fed our despair the kind of
food it thrives on. If we are depressed, the Buddha advises that we look
deeply into the nature of our depression to identify the source of food
that we use to nourish it. Once the source of the nutriments has been
identified, cut it off. The depression will fade away after a week or
two.
:::

::: tx
Without mindfulness in our daily lives, we feed our anger and despair by
looking at or listening to things around us that are highly toxic. We
consume many toxins each day; what we see on television or read in
magazines can nourish our anger and despair. But if we breathe in and
out mindfully and realize that these are not the kinds of things we want
to consume, then we will stop consuming them. To live mindfully means to
stop ingesting these kinds of poisons. Instead, choose to be in touch
with what is wonderful, refreshing, and healing within yourself and
around you.

***Wonderful Moment***
:::

::: tx1
I have a breathing exercise that I would like to offer you. I'm sure
that if you follow this exercise in difficult moments, you will find
relief.
:::

::::::::::::: atx1
::: tx1
Breathing in, I know I am breathing in.
:::

::: tx1
Breathing out, I know I am breathing out.
:::

::: tx
Breathing in, I notice that my in-breath has become deeper.
:::

::: tx
Breathing out, I notice that my out- breath has become slower.
:::

::: tx1
Breathing in, I calm myself.
:::

::: tx1
Breathing out, I feel at ease.
:::

::: tx1
Breathing in, I smile.
:::

::: tx1
Breathing out, I release.
:::

::: tx
Breathing in, I dwell in the present moment.
:::

::: tx
Breathing out, I feel it is a wonderful moment.
:::
:::::::::::::

::::: tx
These verses can be summarized in the following way:
<?dp n="32" folio="20" ?>

:::: atx1
::: tx1
In, Out; Deep, Slow;\
Calm, Ease; Smile, Release;\
Present Moment, Wonderful Moment.
:::
::::
:::::

::: tx
First we practice "In, Out." Breathing in, we say, "In," silently, in
order to nourish the awareness that we are breathing in. When we breathe
out, we say, "Out," aware that we are breathing out. Each word is a
guide to help us return to our breathing in the present moment. We can
repeat, "In, Out" until we find our concentration is peaceful and solid.
:::

::: tx
Then we say, "Deep" with the next in-breath and "Slow" with the next
out-breath. When we breathe consciously, our breathing becomes deeper
and slower, more peaceful and pleasant. We continue to breathe "Deep,
Slow, Deep, Slow," until we want to move to the next phrase, which is
"Calm, Ease."
:::

::: tx
"Calm" means we calm our body, we bring peace to our body. Breathing in,
I bring the element of calm into my body. If
<?dp n="33" folio="21" ?>
we have a feeling or an emotion that makes us feel less peaceful, then
calming means to calm that feeling or emotion. Breathing in, I calm my
emotions. Breathing in, I calm my feelings. When we breathe out, we say,
"Ease," which means being light, relaxed, feeling that nothing is as
important as our well-being.
:::

::: tx
When we have mastered "Calm, Ease," we move to "Smile, Release." When we
breathe in, even if we do not feel great joy at the moment, we can still
smile. When we smile, our joy and peace become even more settled, and
tension vanishes. When we breathe out, we say, "Release." We release
what is making us suffer---an idea, a fear, a worry, anger.
:::

::: tx
And at last, we return to "Present Moment, Wonderful Moment." "Breathing
in, I dwell in the present moment. Breathing out, I feel this is a
wonderful moment." Remember, the Buddha said that the present moment is
the only moment when life is available to us. So in order to touch life
<?dp n="34" folio="22" ?>
deeply, we have to come back to the present moment.
:::

::: tx
Our breath is like a bridge connecting our bodies and our minds. In our
daily lives, our bodies may be in one place and our minds somewhere
else---in the past or in the future. This is called a state of
distraction. The breath is a connection between the body and the mind.
When you begin to breathe in and out mindfully, your body will come back
to your mind and your mind will go back to your body. You will be able
to realize the oneness of body and mind and become fully present and
fully alive in the here and now. You will be in a position to touch life
deeply in the moment. This is not difficult. Everyone can do it.

***Smiling As a Practice***
:::

::: tx1
In the exercise "Breathing in, I smile," you may ask: Why should I smile
when there is no joy in me? The answer to that is: Smiling
<?dp n="35" folio="23" ?>
is a practice. There are over three hundred muscles in your face. When
you are angry or fearful, these muscles tense up. The tension in these
muscles creates a feeling of hardness. If you know how to breathe in and
produce a smile, however, the tension will disappear---it is what I call
"mouth yoga." Make smiling an exercise. Just breathe in and smile---the
tension will disappear and you will feel much better.
:::

::: tx
There are times when your joy produces a smile. There are also times
when a smile causes relaxation, calm, and joy. I do not wait until there
is joy in me to smile; joy will come later. Sometimes when I am alone in
my room in the dark, I practice smiling to myself. I do this to be kind
to myself, to take good care of myself, to love myself. I know that if I
cannot take care of myself, I cannot take care of anyone else.
:::

::: tx
Being compassionate to yourself is a very important practice. When you
are tired, angry, or in despair, you should know how to go back to
yourself and take care of your
<?dp n="36" folio="24" ?>
tiredness, your anger, and your despair. That is why we practice
smiling, mindful walking and breathing, and mindful eating.
:::

***When You Feel Grateful*****,** ***You Do Not Suffer***
:::

::: tx1
I notice that in the United States, where there is so much food and so
many different kinds of things to eat, there is not much time to eat.
Eating can be very joyful, and you don't need to eat a lot to be
healthy.
:::

::: tx
When I pick up my food, whether it is with chopsticks or a fork, I take
time to look at it for a moment. A fraction of a second is enough for me
to identify the food. If I am really in the here and now, I will
recognize the food right away, whether it is a carrot, a string bean, or
bread. I smile at it, put it in my mouth, and chew it with complete
awareness of what I am eating. Mindfulness is always mindfulness *of
something,* and I chew my food in such a way that life, joy,
<?dp n="37" folio="25" ?>
solidity, and non-fear become possible. After twenty minutes of eating,
I feel nourished---not only physically, but also mentally and
spiritually. This is a very, very deep practice.
:::

::: tx
In Plum Village, we take time to eat. We eat as a community. Everyone
sits beautifully and we wait for each other to begin together. When
there is a brother or a sister eating mindfully on your right and on
your left, you feel supported in the practice of eating mindfully. At
the beginning of each meal, we practice the Five Contemplations.

# THE FIVE CONTEMPLATIONS {.h1}

::: tx
This food is the gift of the whole universe, the Earth, the sky, and
much hard work.
:::

::: tx
May we eat in such a way as to be worthy to receive it.
:::

::: tx
May we transform our unskillful states of mind and learn to eat in
moderation.
:::

::: tx
May we take only food that nourishes us and prevents illness.
:::

<?dp n="38" folio="26" ?>

::: tx
We accept this food in order to realize the path of understanding and
love.
:::

<div>

 \

</div>

::: tx
The First Contemplation is being aware that our food comes directly from
the Earth and sky. It is a gift of the Earth and sky, and also of the
people who cook it.
:::

::: tx
The Second Contemplation is about being worthy of the food we eat. The
way to be worthy of our food is to eat mindfully---to be aware of its
presence and thankful for having it. Take the string bean, for example.
The Earth and sky have taken many months to produce a string bean. It is
a pity to look at it and not see it as a miracle of life. The energy of
mindfulness can help us to see how wonderful our food is while we are
eating. We cannot allow ourselves to get lost in our worries, fears, or
anger of the past or the future. We are there for the food because the
food is there for us; it is only fair. Eat in mindfulness and you will
be worthy of the Earth and the sky.
:::

::: tx
The Third Contemplation is about
<?dp n="39" folio="27" ?>
becoming aware of our negative tendencies and not allowing them to carry
us away. We need to learn how to eat in moderation, to eat the right
amount of food. In Plum Village, each one of us has a bowl to eat from,
and every time we serve ourselves, we know exactly how much we really
need. The bowl that is used by a monk or a nun is referred to as an
instrument of appropriate measure. It is very important not to overeat.
If you eat slowly and chew very carefully, you will get plenty of
nutrition. The right amount of food is the amount that helps us stay
healthy.
:::

::: tx
The Fourth Contemplation is about the quality of our food. We are
determined to ingest only food that has no toxins for our body and our
consciousness. We promise to eat only the kinds of food that keep us
healthy and nourish our compassion, and to avoid the kinds of food that
contain or bring poisons into our body and make us less compassionate.
This is mindful eating. The Buddha said that if you eat in such a way
<?dp n="40" folio="28" ?>
that compassion is destroyed in you, it is like eating the flesh of your
own son or daughter. So practice eating in such a way that you can keep
compassion alive in you.
:::

::: tx
The Fifth Contemplation is being aware that we receive food in order to
realize something. Our lives should have meaning, and that meaning is to
help people suffer less, help people touch the joys of life. When we
have compassion in our hearts, when we know that we are able to help a
person suffer less, life begins to have more meaning. This is very
important food for us.
:::

::: tx
A single person is capable of helping many living beings. My colleague
Sister Chân Không has been working with poor people, orphans, and the
hungry for many years. She has helped thousands and thousands of people,
and because of her work these people suffer less. This brings her a lot
of joy and gives her life meaning. This can be true for all of us
anytime, anywhere. Just saying a few words that make another person
suffer less can give our lives meaning.
<?dp n="41" folio="29" ?>
And it is something we can do anywhere.
:::

::: tx
When your life is meaningful, happiness becomes a reality and you become
a *bodhisattva* right here and now. A bodhisattva is someone who has
compassion within himself or herself and who is able to make another
person smile or help someone suffer less. Every one of us is capable of
this.

***Compassion As a Liberating Factor***
:::

::: tx1
Every moment of your daily life can be a moment of practice. Whether you
are waiting for your food or lining up to be counted, you can always
practice breathing mindfully or practice smiling. Do not waste a moment
of your daily life. Every moment is an opportunity to cultivate your
solidity, peace, and joy. And after a few days, you will see people
beginning to profit from your presence. Your presence can become the
presence of a bodhisattva, a saint. It is possible.
:::

<?dp n="42" folio="30" ?>

::: tx
There is a story that I read when I was seven years old. It was a Jataka
story, which is a story about a former life of the Buddha. This story is
about one of his lives before he became Buddha, when he was in Hell. The
guard who was in charge of the inmates of Hell did not seem to have any
compassion. He carried a big pitchfork, and every time anyone did
something wrong, he would plunge the pitchfork into that person's chest.
Although the inmates suffered greatly from their treatment, they could
not die. That was their punishment: They suffered, but they did not die.
:::

::: tx
One day, the inmates were forced to carry heavy loads on their backs.
The guard, with his pitchfork in hand, began to push them to go faster.
The Buddha (in this previous incarnation) saw that one of the inmates
could not keep up and that the guard was beginning to pick on him,
threatening him with the pitchfork to make him move faster. At that
moment, something was born in the Buddha. He wanted to
<?dp n="43" folio="31" ?>
intervene, to confront the guard even though he knew the guard would
then turn on him. If his intervention would have resulted in his dying,
he would have done it gladly. But the kind of punishment he could have
expected in return would not have led to his death, only to more
suffering. Even so, he courageously approached the guard and said,
"Don't you have a heart? Why don't you give him time to carry his load?"
Upon hearing this, the guard plunged the pitchfork into the chest of the
Buddha, who died instantly and was born again as a human being.
:::

::: tx
It took courage for the Buddha to stand up and look the guard straight
in the face for the sake of a fellow prisoner. He saw injustice, and as
a result of so much suffering, compassion was born in his heart. His
intervention was born from compassion. This was why he died right away
and was born as a human being. From that time on, the Buddha began
practicing until the time he became a fully enlightened person, a
<?dp n="44" folio="32" ?>
Buddha. So even the Buddha, in one of his former lives, had hit the
bottom of suffering. But thanks to the compassion born in his heart, he
was able to liberate himself from his situation.
:::

::: tx
I have lived through a lot of suffering myself, and I can tell you that
compassion can free you from the most difficult situations. It is the
energy of compassion that helps us and provides us with a way out of
difficult situations. There was a time when we brought boats into the
Gulf of Siam to rescue boat people. Doing this work can be very
dangerous because there are many pirates on the sea. But because we
believed that the best means of self-protection was compassion, not
violence, we never had guns on our boats while we were rescuing people;
we only had compassion. According to the teaching and the practice I
follow, compassion is the best means for self-protection.
:::

::: tx
In Buddhist circles, we speak about *Avalokiteshvara,* the bodhisattva
of deep compassion and deep listening. The bodhisattva
<?dp n="45" folio="33" ?>
can manifest as a woman, a man, a child, a politician, or a slave, but
the main characteristic of the bodhisattva is always the same---the
presence of compassion in his or her heart. One time Avalokiteshvara
manifested as a hungry ghost with a very ferocious face. He took on that
appearance to help other hungry ghosts, but in truth, he was a
compassionate being. Many of us are afraid of being attacked, so we
sometimes pretend to be tough and cruel to protect ourselves, even
though we have compassion and understanding inside. Without compassion,
we suffer a lot and we make people around us suffer. With compassion, we
can relate to other living beings and we can help them suffer less.
:::

::: tx
If you are inhabited by the energy of compassion, you live in the safest
of environments. Compassion can be expressed in your eyes, in the way
you act or react, in the way you walk, sit, eat, or deal with other
people. It is the best means of self-protection. It can also be
contagious. It is very
<?dp n="46" folio="34" ?>
wonderful to sit close to someone who has compassion in his or her
heart. With compassion in your heart, you will win over a friend or two
friends---because we all need compassion and love. Two people together
can protect each other and those around them, too.
:::

::: tx
It is our practice to cultivate compassion in our daily lives. With the
practice of compassion, we open to one person and then another, and
finally, when compassion is present, any place can be a pleasant place
to live. When the element of joy enters our bodies and consciousnesses,
together we find peace and joy right here, right now.

***Understanding Makes Compassion Possible***
:::

::: tx1
Understanding is the substance out of which we fabricate compassion.
What kind of understanding am I talking about? It is the understanding
that the other person
<?dp n="47" folio="35" ?>
suffers, too. When we suffer, we tend to believe that we are the victims
of other people, that we are the only ones who suffer. That is not
true---the other person also suffers. He has his difficulties, his
fears, and his worries, too. If we could only see the pain within him,
we would begin to understand him. Once understanding is present,
compassion becomes possible.
:::

::: tx
Do we have enough time to look into the condition of the other person?
The other person may be an inmate like us or a guard. If we look, we can
see that there is a lot of suffering within him. Maybe he does not know
how to handle his suffering. Maybe he allows his suffering to grow
because he does not know how to handle it, and this makes him and other
people around him suffer. So with this kind of awareness or mindfulness,
you begin to understand, and understanding will give rise to your
compassion. With compassion in you, you will suffer much less, and you
will be motivated by a desire to do something---or not do
<?dp n="48" folio="36" ?>
something---so that the other person suffers less. Your way of looking
or smiling at him may help him suffer less and give him faith in
compassion.
:::

::: tx
I would describe my practice as the practice of cultivating compassion.
But I know that compassion is not possible without understanding. And
understanding is possible only if you have time to look deeply.
Meditation means to look deeply in order to understand. In the monastery
where I live, we have plenty of time to do the work of looking deeply.
In a correctional house, there is also plenty of time and opportunity to
practice looking deeply. It is a very good environment to practice
looking deeply so that compassion can grow as a liberating factor. I
think that if one, or ten, or twenty of you practice compassionate
looking, you can transform this place in no time at all. You can bring
paradise right here.
:::

::: tx
For me, paradise is a place where there is compassion. When there is
compassion in your heart, you need only to breathe in and
<?dp n="49" folio="37" ?>
out and look deeply, and understanding will come. You will understand
yourself and become compassionate toward yourself; you will know how to
handle your suffering and take care of yourself. Then you will be able
to help another person do the same, and compassion will grow between
you. Thus, you become a Buddha, a bodhisattva who brings compassion into
his environment and transforms Hell into Paradise. The Kingdom of God is
now or never. This is very true. And it could be that you have more
opportunities to practice than many of us. What do you think?

***The Art of Handling a Storm***
:::

::: tx1
When a storm comes, it stays for some time, and then it goes. An emotion
is like that too---it comes and stays for a while, and then it goes. An
emotion is only an emotion. We are much, much more than an emotion. We
don't die because of one emotion.
<?dp n="50" folio="38" ?>
So when you notice that an emotion is beginning to come up, it is very
important that you put yourself in a stable sitting position, or you lie
down, which is also a very stable position. Then focus your attention on
your belly. Your head is like the top of a tree in a storm. I would not
stay there. Bring your attention down to the trunk of the tree, where
there is stability.
:::

::: tx
When you have focused on your belly, bring your attention down to the
level just below the navel and begin to practice mindful breathing.
Breathing in and breathing out deeply, be aware of the rise and fall of
the abdomen. After practicing like this for ten, fifteen, or twenty
minutes, you will see that you are strong---strong enough to withstand
the storm. In this sitting or lying position, just stick to your
breathing the way that someone on the ocean would stick to a life vest.
After some time the emotion will pass.
:::

::: tx
This is a very effective practice, but please remember one thing: Don't
wait until you have a strong emotion to practice. If you do,
<?dp n="51" folio="39" ?>
you will not remember how to practice. You have to practice now, today,
while you are feeling fine, when you are not dealing with any strong
emotions. This is the time to begin learning the practice. You can
practice for ten minutes every day. Sit and practice breathing in and
out, focusing your attention on your belly. If you do this for three
weeks---twenty-one days---it will become a habit. Then when anger rises
up or you are overwhelmed by despair, you will naturally remember the
practice. Once you succeed, you will have faith in the practice and you
will be able to tell your emotion, "Well, if you come again, I will do
exactly the same thing." You will not be afraid because you know what to
do.
:::

::: tx
Practice regularly. Once your practice becomes a habit, you will feel as
though you are missing something when you don't do it. It will bring you
well-being and stability. It will have a good effect on your health as
well. This is the best kind of protection you can offer yourself. I
always think that the
<?dp n="52" folio="40" ?>
energy of mindfulness is the energy of the Buddha, the energy of God,
the Holy Spirit, that is inside of us protecting us all the time. Every
time you touch the seed of mindfulness and practice mindful breathing,
the energy of God, the energy of the Buddha, is there to protect you.
:::

::: tx
When you learn the practice, you may like to tell a friend, a relative,
or your children, if you have any, how to practice. I know mothers who
practice with their children. They hold their child's hand and say,
"Darling, breathe with me. Breathing in, I am aware that my abdomen is
rising. Breathing out, I am aware that my abdomen is falling." They
guide their child to breathe with them until he or she gets through the
emotion.
:::

::: tx
If you know the practice, you will be able to generate the energy of
stability, and you will be able to hold another person's hand and
transmit to him or her the energy of your stability. You can help that
person cross out of the eye of the storm; it may help save
<?dp n="53" folio="41" ?>
someone's life. So many young people these days don't know how to handle
their emotions. The number of people who commit suicide is enormous.
This is a simple exercise, but very important.

***Smile at Your Habit Energy***
:::

::: tx1
There is a strong energy in every one of us called habit energy.
*Vasana* is the Sanskrit word for habit energy. Every one of us has
habit energies that push us to say and do things we don't want to say or
do. These habit energies damage us and our relationships to other
people. Intellectually we know that saying or doing a certain thing will
cause a lot of suffering, and yet we still say or do it. And once you
say or do something, the damage is done. Then you regret it. You beat
your chest and pull your hair. You say, "I am not going to say or do
that thing again." But though you say this with sincerity, the next time
the situation presents itself, you
<?dp n="54" folio="42" ?>
say and do the same thing. This is the power of habit energy that your
parents and ancestors may have transmitted to you.
:::

::: tx
Mindful breathing can help you recognize habit energy when it emerges.
You don't have to fight that energy; you only have to recognize it as
yours and smile at it. That is enough. "Hello there, my habit energy. I
know you're there, but you cannot do anything to me." You smile at it,
and then you are free. This is a wonderful protection. It is why I said
mindfulness is the energy of God, the energy of the Buddha protecting
us.
:::

::: tx
In order for the energy of mindfulness to work for you, it is very
important that you practice mindful walking and mindful breathing each
day. When the habit energy begins to manifest, continue to breathe,
recognize it, and say, "Hello, my habit energy. I know you are there,
but I am free. You are not going to push me to say and do those things
again." This is how you acquire a different way of reacting---you create
a good habit energy to replace the bad habit energy.
:::

<?dp n="55" folio="43" ?>

::: tx
Our relationships with other people are crucial to our happiness.
Sometimes we treat others or ourselves badly because of habit energy. We
should treat ourselves with respect, tenderness, and compassion. This is
very important. If we know how to treat our bodies and feelings with
respect, we will be able to treat other people with the same respect.
This is the way we create peace, freedom, and happiness in the world.
Every one of us is capable of doing this. We only need a little
training. To have a friend who knows the practice is fortunate. With two
people practicing, you can support each other in the practice of
cultivating that energy called mindfulness---mindfulness of walking,
mindfulness of breathing, mindfulness of eating.
:::

::: tx
Every moment of our daily lives can be used to cultivate
mindfulness---the energy of the Buddha, the Holy Spirit. Wherever the
Holy Spirit is, there is understanding, forgiveness, and compassion. The
energy of mindfulness has the same nature. If you
<?dp n="56" folio="44" ?>
know how to generate this energy, you become truly present, truly alive,
and you become capable of understanding. With understanding you will
become compassionate, and that will change everything.

<?dp n="59" folio="47" ?>
do it correctly, three or four hours will not bring you the desired
effect. It is good to have a friend, a brother or a sister who is
successful in the practice, to help and support you.
:::

::: bmtx
You can also do it alone. When you breathe in, allow yourself to breathe
in naturally. Focus all your attention on the in-breath. When you
breathe out, allow yourself to breathe out normally. Just become aware
of your out-breath; don't interfere with it. Don't use force. If you
allow yourself to breathe in and out naturally and become aware of your
breath, there will be improvement in only fifteen or twenty seconds. You
will begin to feel pleasure in breathing in and out.

I once held a retreat in Montréal, Canada. After the first session of
walking meditation, a lady came to me and asked, "Thây, can you
authorize me to share the practice of walking meditation with other
people?" In the seven years since she had come to this country, she had
not been able to walk with
<?dp n="60" folio="48" ?>
as much serenity and peace as she experienced after just one session of
walking meditation at the retreat. It was so healing, so refreshing for
her that she wanted to share this practice of mindful walking with her
friends. I said, "Why not?" She is proof that after one hour of walking
meditation, a person is able to find relief and joy. But it is not to be
measured by time. Whether it is mindful breathing, mindful walking,
mindful eating, or mindful working, when you feel the effect right away
and when the practice is pleasant, the practice is correct.

Q: How much time should I give to the practice?
:::

<div>

 \

</div>

::: bmtx1
A: The kind of meditation that I advocate can be done anytime. While you
walk from one place to another, you can apply the techniques of mindful
walking. When you do your work, you can practice mindful working. When
you eat lunch, you can practice mindful eating. You don't have to
<?dp n="61" folio="49" ?>
set up a specific time to practice; it can be done at any time of the
day.
:::

::: bmtx
If the situation permits, however, you can set aside time to do specific
things, like waking up fifteen minutes earlier so that you can enjoy
fifteen minutes of sitting meditation. Or before going to sleep---even
after the lights have been turned off---you can sit on your bed to do
fifteen minutes of mindful breathing. Because there are things you have
to do collectively with other people, you may not be able to find a
specific time to do what you want to do. So it will depend on how
creative you can be with your time. But remember, the practice is
available to you at any time, even when you go to urinate or while you
are washing the floors.
:::

::: bmtx
You can scrub the floor as a free person or as a slave. That is up to
you. Here, everyone has to do certain things, but you can do them as a
free person. You can cultivate your freedom. This brings a lot of
dignity, and everyone will sense it. With the practice,
<?dp n="62" folio="50" ?>
you are really free, no matter what situation you find yourself in.
:::

::: bmtx
I propose that every time you go to the toilet---every time you
defecate, urinate, and wash your hands---you invest one hundred percent
of yourself in the act. Stop all thinking; just enjoy doing it. It can
be very pleasant. In a few weeks, you will see the wonderful effect of
this practice.

Q: Can you define mindfulness? How can we practice with so many
distractions?
:::

<div>

 \

</div>

::: bmtx1
A: In Vietnamese, "mindfulness" is *chanh niem,* which means to be truly
present in the moment. When you eat, you know that you are eating. When
you walk, you know that you are walking. The opposite of mindfulness is
forgetfulness. You eat but you don't know that you are eating, because
your mind is elsewhere. When you bring your mind back to what is
happening in the here and now, that is mindfulness, and mindfulness can
bring you a lot of life,
<?dp n="63" folio="51" ?>
pleasure, and joy. The simple act of eating an orange, for instance, can
be a thousand times more pleasant if you eat it mindfully than if you
eat it while you are caught up in your worries, anger, or despair. So
mindfulness is the energy that helps you be fully present with whatever
is there.
:::

::: bmtx
Suppose you hear noises in your surroundings. You can use noise as the
object of mindfulness. "Breathing in, I can hear a lot of noise.
Breathing out, I smile at this noise. I know that people making noise
are not always peaceful, and I feel compassion toward them." So
practicing mindful breathing and using the suffering that is around you
as the object of your mindfulness will help the energies of
understanding and compassion arise in you.
:::

::: bmtx
At a retreat, a woman complained that her roommate's snoring did not
allow her to sleep. She was about to take her sleeping bag and go to the
meditation hall when she suddenly remembered what I had taught, and she
decided to stay. She used the sound
<?dp n="64" folio="52" ?>
as a bell of mindfulness to engender compassion. "Breathing in, I am
aware of the snoring. Breathing out, I smile at it." Ten minutes later,
she was sound asleep. It was a wonderful discovery for her.

Q: Could you speak a little bit about forgiveness?
:::

<div>

 \

</div>

::: bmtx1
A: Forgiveness is the fruit of understanding. Sometimes even when we
want to forgive someone, we cannot. The goodwill to forgive may be
there, but the bitterness and suffering are still there, too. For me,
forgiveness is the result of looking deeply and understanding.
:::

::: bmtx
One morning, in the office we had in Paris during the seventies and
eighties, we received very bad news. A letter came saying that an
eleven-year-old girl, a passenger on a boat leaving Vietnam, had been
raped by a sea pirate. When her father tried to intervene, they threw
him into the ocean. So the little girl jumped into the ocean too,
<?dp n="65" folio="53" ?>
and drowned. I was angry. As a human being, you have the right to get
angry; but as a practitioner, you do not have the right to stop
practicing.
:::

::: bmtx
I could not eat my breakfast; the news was too much for me. I practiced
walking meditation in the woods nearby. I tried to get in touch with the
trees, the birds, and the blue sky in order to calm myself, and then I
sat down and meditated. The meditation lasted quite a long time.
:::

::: bmtx
During the meditation, I saw myself born as a baby in the coastal area
of Thailand. My father was a poor fisherman, my mother was a woman
without education. There was poverty all around me. When I was fourteen,
I had to work with my father on the fishing boat to earn our living; it
was very hard work. When my father died, I had to take over the business
by myself to support the family.
:::

::: bmtx
A fisherman I knew told me that a lot of boat people coming out of
Vietnam often carried their valuables, like gold and jewelry,
<?dp n="66" folio="54" ?>
with them. He suggested that if we intercepted just one of these boats
and took some of the gold, we would be rich. Being a poor, young
fisherman with no education, I was tempted. And one day, I decided to go
with him to rob the boat people. When I saw the fisherman rape a female
on the boat, I was tempted to do that, too. I looked around, and when I
saw there was nothing to stop me---no police, no threat---I said to
myself, "I can do it, too, just once." That is how I became a sea pirate
raping a little girl.
:::

::: bmtx
Now suppose you are on the boat and you have a gun. If you shoot me and
kill me, your act will not help me. In all my life, no one helped me,
and in all their lives, no one helped my father or my mother. As a
little boy, I was raised without an education. I played with delinquent
children, and grew up to become a poor fisherman. No politician or
educator ever helped me. And because no one helped me, I became a sea
pirate. If you shoot me, I will die.
:::

::: bmtx
That night I meditated on this. Once
<?dp n="67" folio="55" ?>
again I saw myself as a young fisherman becoming a sea pirate. I also
saw a few hundred babies being born that night all along the coastline
of Thailand. I realized that if no one helped these babies to grow up
with an education and with an opportunity to lead a decent life, in
twenty years some of these babies would be sea pirates. I began to
understand that if I had been born as a little boy in that fishing
village, I too might have become a sea pirate. When I understood that,
my anger toward the pirates melted.
:::

::: bmtx
Instead of getting angry at the fisherman, I felt compassion toward him.
I vowed if I could do anything to help the babies that had been born
that night along the coast of Thailand, I would help. The energy called
anger was transformed into the energy of compassion through meditation.
Forgiveness cannot be obtained without that sort of understanding, and
understanding is the fruit of looking deeply, which I call meditation.

Q: What is the essence of Buddhism? Is it
<?dp n="68" folio="56" ?>
a religion? And was Buddha a god?
:::

<div>

 \

</div>

::: bmtx1
A: The Buddha always reminds us that he is a human being, not a god. He
is a teacher. He left behind many discourses that he gave to his
disciples. They are called sutras. This morning I offered you the
practice of mindful breathing. This comes from the sutra called the
*Discourse on Mindful Breathing*. In this text, he offers sixteen
exercises of mindful breathing to deal with the difficulties in our
daily lives, to cultivate wisdom, compassion, and so on. There are other
discourses on the practice of mindfulness that lead to transformation
and healing. They are not prayers; they are texts that teach you how to
deal with suffering and difficulties in your daily life.
:::

::: bmtx
Buddhism originally was not a religion; it was a way of life. The sutras
are the teachings of the Buddha on how to transform suffering and
cultivate joy and compassion. As Buddhist monks, we learn many of these
sutras, and we learn how to explain them to people in a way that they
know exactly how
<?dp n="69" folio="57" ?>
to practice these teachings.
:::

::: bmtx
In the Buddhist tradition, we honor the Three Jewels. The First Jewel is
the Buddha, the one who found a way of understanding, love,
transformation, and healing. The Second Jewel is the Dharma, the path of
transformation and healing, which was offered by the Buddha in the form
of discourses, teachings, and practices. The Third Jewel is the
community of practice, the Sangha---the men and women who have formed a
community and taken up the path of meditation and mindfulness practice.
:::

::: bmtx
Sangha means "community." Everyone in the community practices mindful
breathing, mindful walking, and generating compassion and understanding.
It is our practice to take refuge in the Sangha because a real Sangha is
a community where true practice exists---true mindfulness,
understanding, and compassion. A true Sangha carries within itself the
true Dharma and the true Buddha. So when you get in touch with a true
<?dp n="70" folio="58" ?>
Sangha, you also get in touch with the Buddha and the Dharma.
:::

::: bmtx
With a Sangha, you have a chance to succeed, because the Sangha is
instrumental in protecting and supporting you in the practice. Without a
Sangha, you might abandon your practice after a few months. We have a
saying that when a tiger leaves the mountain to go to the lowland, it
will be captured by humans and killed. A practitioner must stay with his
or her Sangha or he or she may abandon the practice after a few months.
The support and guidance given by the Sangha are very important.
:::

::: bmtx
Even here, you can set up your own Sangha of four or five people who do
the practice daily---mindful walking, breathing, eating, and working. A
Sangha can give the support that is needed. A Sangha can be made up of
laypeople or monastics, but wherever there are at least four people who
practice mindfulness together, there is a Sangha. Taking refuge in the
Sangha is very important. If the Sangha really practices, it
<?dp n="71" folio="59" ?>
contains the Buddha and the Dharma within it.

Q: What is mindfulness and what can it bring about?
:::

<div>

 \

</div>

::: bmtx1
A: Mindfulness, as I have said, is the capacity of being present in the
here and now. Focus your attention on what is going on. If mindfulness
is there, concentration will be there, too. If you continue to be
mindful of something, then you will concentrate on it; it will become
the object of your concentration. When your mindfulness and
concentration are good, you will be able to receive insights; you will
begin to understand in depth what is really happening in the here and
now. So the process is mindfulness, concentration, and insight. The
insight helps you to understand, and it liberates you from your wrong
perceptions. It makes you stop suffering.

Q: Can we think of the past and plan for the future?
:::

<div>

 \

</div>

::: bmtx1
A: Mindfulness means to establish yourself in the present moment. But
that does not mean you don't have the right to scrutinize and learn from
the past or plan for the future. If you are really grounded in the
present moment and the future becomes the object of your mindfulness,
you can look deeply at the future to see what you can do in the present
moment for such a future to become possible. We say that the best way of
taking care of the future is to take care of the present, because the
future is made of the present. Taking care of the present moment is one
of the best things you can do in order to ensure a good future.
:::

::: bmtx
When we bring past events to the present moment and make them the object
of our mindfulness, it teaches us a lot. When we were part of those
events, we could not see them as clearly as we do now. With the practice
of mindfulness, we have new eyes, and we can learn many things from the
past.

Q: Please say a little more about breathing.
:::

<div>

 \

</div>

::: bmtx1
A: The quality of breathing improves with your practice. Your breath
becomes deeper and slower. It brings more pleasure into your body and
consciousness, and yet, everything else is the same. As you continue to
breathe, walk, and sit as you normally do, the quality of your
breathing, walking, and sitting improves. The practice of conscious
breathing should bring you more pleasure, life, and joy. Nothing
negative should come out of the practice of meditation; if we experience
qualities opposite to those of peace, relaxation, and joy, there is
something wrong. Meditation should only increase our quality of life in
the present moment.

Q: I think in the West the emphasis is on being successful. Is there
such a thing as success?
:::

<div>

 \

</div>

::: bmtx1
A: Take walking meditation as an example. We may do walking meditation
for a while,
<?dp n="74" folio="62" ?>
enjoying every step. Then because we like looking at things such as
trees, rocks, clouds, etc., we spot a very beautiful flower in front of
us and we want to stop our walking meditation and contemplate its
beauty. There is nothing wrong with this, because even when we stop
walking, our enjoyment continues.
:::

::: bmtx
The same is true with meditation. While you are enjoying your in-breath
and out-breath, an idea may suddenly come to you. You have the freedom
to choose to continue with your mindful breathing or to stay with the
idea. You can decide to say to your idea, "I would like to continue with
my mindful breathing before I spend time with you." If that idea accepts
your decision, it will recede into the background so you can continue
your meditation. It is like looking through a pile of letters on your
desk and setting a special letter aside to read last.
:::

::: bmtx
Mindfulness can be mindfulness of anything you like in the present
moment. What if the idea is very strong and wants your attention right
away? Then you can say,
<?dp n="75" folio="63" ?>
"Okay, I'll stop focusing on my breathing now and pay attention to you."
Then you can decide to focus all your attention on this new object of
meditation. There is no harm in this.
:::

::: bmtx
If during sitting meditation you begin to feel some pain in your legs
after just ten minutes, you may think that you have to bear the pain and
sit for the entire fifteen minutes; otherwise you will have failed. You
do not have to feel this way. You can practice mindful massaging
instead. "Breathing in, I know that I am starting to change my sitting
position. Breathing out, I smile at my muscle pain." You are free to
choose the object of your mindfulness. You have not abandoned
meditation. Not one second of your meditation has been lost. You have
not failed.

:::

</div>

::: bmtx1
A: I have studied Christianity and I have found many teachings on
mindfulness in Christianity, and also in Judaism and Islam. I think that
mindfulness has a universal nature. You can find it in every spiritual
tradition. If you study deeply the life of a sage from any tradition,
you will find a quality of mindfulness in his or her life. A sage is
capable of living every moment of his or her life deeply and of touching
the beauty and truth in each moment of life.
:::

::: bmtx
I think it is possible to profit from many traditions at the same time.
If you love oranges, you are welcome to eat them, but nothing prevents
you from enjoying kiwis or mangoes as well. Why commit yourself to only
one kind of fruit when the whole spiritual heritage of humankind is
available to
<?dp n="77" folio="65" ?>
you? It is possible to have Buddhist roots as well as Christian or
Jewish roots. We grow very strong that way.

::: bmtx1
A: I have said that in every cell of your body, you can find both Heaven
and Hell. The higher or lower spiritual force is right there inside of
you. When you have compassion, you can touch compassion everywhere. When
you have violence and hatred, you will connect with those energies
around you. This is why it is very important to select the channel you
want to be on.
:::

::: bmtx
If you decide to nourish yourself with positive energies only, then the
energy of mindfulness will help you distinguish between energies that
are appropriate for you and those that are not---which people you should
associate with, what kind of food you should eat, what kind of
television programs
<?dp n="78" folio="66" ?>
you should watch, and so on. Mindfulness is capable of telling you
things you need and things that are harmful to you.

the vegetables or wash dishes, poetry is born in me. When I sit down at
the writing table, all I do is deliver the poems. Poetry comes as an
inspiration and is the fruit of my mindful living. After a poem is born,
I may realize that it helped me. The poem is like a "bell of
mindfulness."
:::

::: bmtx
Sometimes you need to reread a poem you have written because it takes
you back to a wonderful experience---it reminds you of the beauty
available inside of you and all around you. So a poem is a flower you
offer to the world, and at the same time, it is a bell of mindfulness
for you to remember the presence of beauty in your daily life.

::: aptx1
I watched in amazement as a tiny man, Thich Nhat Hanh, gracefully walked
onto the stage at the Maryland Correctional Institution in Hagerstown
and sat down crosslegged. I was amazed because there were some eighty
guests from all over the United States and the world, and more than one
hundred and twenty restless prisoners all sitting in the auditorium
waiting for the appearance of this man, and he ignored all of us.
:::

::: aptx
He sat down in mindful meditation, although we did not know this at
first. He sat in peace and repose, oblivious to the noise and confusion
of staff scurrying around to place amplification equipment, oblivious to
the whispers and murmuring of the audience, and oblivious to the
ministrations of his entourage. And frankly, many people just stared.
How could he sit there so blissfully?
<?dp n="81" folio="69" ?>
How could the guest of honor ignore us? His face was calm and remarkably
unlined. He just sat there.
:::

::: aptx
And we reacted to his peace before he even said a word. The staff tested
the audio until satisfied and then left the equipment in place and
exited the stage, the echoes from their feet on the hardwood floors
finally silent. The murmuring in the room gradually got lower and lower,
and ceased. His entourage became satisfied that the scatter rugs and
blankets were properly positioned on the stage, and settled themselves
into their own mindful meditation.
:::

::: aptx
And before he ever opened his mouth, he had our rapt attention. We
wanted what he had. And as a result, the Maryland Correctional
Institution Weekly prisoner newsletter just reported the implementation
of a new meditation program! Amazing impact from a humble man who began
by ignoring his audience.

The prison environment is simultaneously one of the most crucial places
for one to have a strong spiritual practice, and one of the most
difficult places for it to bloom and sustain itself. Having worked in
prisons for thirty years, I am truly thrilled to see Dharma-elders such
as Thich Nhat Hanh speaking directly to prisoners about both the
importance and difficulties of such practice. Prisoners need books such
as this one, and we on the outside need the prisoners' own example of
right effort and dedication to inspire us in meeting our own challenges.
May Dharma and Compassion continue to break down the walls from both
sides, so that we may see through the formidable differences in our
environments and backgrounds to the eternal unity we share in the refuge
of our essential Nature.
