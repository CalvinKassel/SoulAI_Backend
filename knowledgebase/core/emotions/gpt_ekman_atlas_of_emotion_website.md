Ekman's Atlas of Emotion Website 										

Most emotions researchers agree on these five Universal Emotions: emotions that all humans, no matter where or how we were raised, have in common. Tap on an emotion to start exploring.										

										

										

				Our worldview, which is influenced by our prior experiences, personal history and inherited universal scripts about important events						

										

		Types of Emotion	"Trigger \- Our emotions unfold on a timeline. The timeline begins with a trigger that initiates an emotional experience and ultimately results in a response.

 The trigger occurs in a context:

    Current circumstances and feelings

    The event

    Our worldview, which is influenced by our prior experiences, personal history and inherited universal scripts about important events"	"Emotional Experience \- The emotional experience that is triggered includes subjective feelings and physical sensations. These color our perception of a situation.

We have a choice in how we respond, although sometimes it's hard to feel in control of our responses. Some responses are more constructive than others."	Actions	"Emotion Saturation \- 

 When an emotion is triggered we are in the grip of that emotion, which limits our ability to think clearly and choose how we respond.

As time passes, we gain some clarity and the ability to make a thoughtful choice.

With awareness we can pause before we respond and choose a response that best serves our goals. "	Antidotes	"Impediments \- 

Here are some ways to counteract emotional states. Impediments involve blocking a positive emotion; antidotes involve reversing negative ones."	

Anger	"We feel anger when we are mentally or physically blocked. Anger varies in strength and frequency in our lives.ANGRY

Suppressing our frustration can be constructive in cases where it helps us avoid arguments, but destructive if we are being hurt by not speaking up for ourselves.

Insult 

Disparage the other person in an offensive or hurtful way that is likely to escalate the conflict rather than resolve it.

Quarrel

Verbally oppose in a manner intended to escalate the disagreement.

Scream

Lose control of one's speech; speak loudly and possibly at a higher pitch.

Simmer / Brood

Express anger by sulking.

Supress

Try to avoid feeling or acting upon the emotion that is being experienced.

Use Physical Force

Harm or trap someone

Undermine

Take action to make someone or something weaker or less effective, usually in a secret or gradual way.

Frustration        Letting go, letting go of grasping, putting things in a larger perspective.

Argumentativeness        Making effort to understand the other’s perspective, cognitive empathy, benevolence, wishing to solve the problem through a mutually agreeable solution.

Exasperation        Letting go of grasping. Patience, inner calm. Trying to understand the causes and conditions that brought about the undesirable situation.

Vengefulness        Contemplating the negative effects of taking revenge, in the short and long term; forgiveness not as condoning harmful behavior but as breaking the cycle of resentment and hatred.

Fury        Taking a break, physically and mentally, from the circumstances that brought fury about. Looking at fury itself with the eye of awareness as if gazing at a raging fire and slowly letting it calm down."

Psychopathology \- Each emotion relates to distinct psychopathologies, which describe persistent behaviors that interfere with one’s ability to function.										

Anger										

A tendency to cause physical or verbal harm in inappropriate contexts. Anger may be out of control, or passive but persistently preoccupying.										

Intermittent Explosive Disorder	Impulsively aggressive and assaultive behaviors out of proportion to triggers.									

Oppositional Defiance Disorder	A pattern of defiant, disobedient and hostile behavior in children or teens toward parents and people in authority, beyond normal age-appropriate misbehavior.									

Antisocial Personality Disorder	Characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for the rights of other people that often manifests as hostility and/or aggression. Deceit and manipulation are also central features.									

Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder	Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g., verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g., physical aggression toward people or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation.									

										

Fear										

Anxiety states involve prolonged fear without knowledge of the source of the threat, and incidents of panic (episodic attacks of severe anxiety).										

Social Anxiety Disorder	A persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. The individual fears that he or she will act (or show anxiety symptoms) in a way that will be embarrassing and humiliating.									

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)	A mental health condition that’s triggered by an often overwhelmingly terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.									

Avoidant Personality Disorder	Characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy and a hypersensitivity to negative evaluation. People with this disorder are intensely afraid that others will ridicule them, reject them or criticize them.									

Generalized Anxiety Disorder	An anxiety disorder that is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable and often irrational worry and apprehensive expectation about events or activities.									

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)	An anxiety disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts that produce uneasiness, apprehension, fear or worry (obsessions); repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing the associated anxiety (compulsions); or a combination of both obsessions and compulsions.									

										

Disgust										

The psychopathology of disgust includes feelings that prevent everyday interaction with the world, the self or others. Disgust can be a paralyzing feeling that makes simple interactions (such as eating) extremely painful if not impossible. Disgust and fear are both thought to contribute to various phobias, such as fear of small animals.										

Anorexia Nervosa	A distorted self-image that may be maintained by various cognitive biases that alter how the affected individual evaluates and thinks about their body, food and eating. People with anorexia nervosa often view themselves as disgusting, overweight or “big” even when they are underweight.									

Body Dysmorphic Disorder	A body-image disorder characterized by persistent and intrusive preoccupations with an imagined or slight defect in one’s appearance or a feeling of disgust with one’s appearance.									

Bulimia	A disorder characterized by repeated binging on large quantities of food followed by induced vomiting; both the binging and purging may be accompanied by feelings of self-disgust.									

Sexual Aversion Disorder	Characterized by disgust, fear, revulsion or lack of desire in consensual relationships involving genital contact.									

										

Sadness										

Depression is a well-known type of psychopathology that is reported to affect over 25% of the population. Depression interferes with daily life and causes pain for both the sufferers and those who care about them. Depression is a common but serious illness.										

Major Depressive Disorder	Also known as clinical depression, major depression or unipolar depression, this is a mental disorder characterized by a pervasive and persistent low mood that is accompanied by low self-esteem and by a loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities.									

Dysthymia	Sometimes also called neurotic depression, dysthymic disorder or chronic depression, this is a mood disorder consisting of the same cognitive and physical problems as depression, with less severe but longer-lasting symptoms.									

Bipolar Disorder	Also known as bipolar affective disorder (and originally called manic-depressive illness), this is a mental disorder characterized by periods of elevated mood and periods of depression.									

										

Enjoyment										

Unlike with other emotions, it is hard to imagine enjoyable emotions contributing to challenges in managing our everyday relationships, work and ability to meet our basic needs. However, pathological enjoyment is quite serious; hyper-elevated states of enjoyment can cause delusions in addition to feeling good, which can lead to destructive behaviors.										

Mania/Manic Episode	Mania at its extreme is commonly characterized by frenzied, ungovernable exuberance — essentially elation not grounded in reality. Frequently, confidence and self-esteem are excessively enlarged, and grand, extravagant ideas are expressed; this is called “grandiosity.” Mania is often part of bipolar disorder.									

Cyclothemia	This is characterized by moods that shift noticeably up and down from a person’s baseline. The person may feel on top of the world for a time, followed by a low period when their feeling is somewhat blue. Between these cyclothymic highs and lows, the person may feel stable and fine.									

										

	"Signal

The signal of an emotion describes the universal ways that emotion is displayed in the face and/or voice. There can also be other vocal tone changes and body language indicators, but these are not included here because they are often culturally informed and learned as opposed to universal."	"Message

The message is what the emotion is telling us. All emotions have a message that is a response to the world around us."								

Anger	In the voice, anger generates a roar if not controlled; when anger is controlled, the voice may have a sharp edge that is very detectable. In the face, the signal includes glaring eyes, lowered brows and narrowed, tightened lips. When people hear or see an angry signal, they are typically hurt just by the perception of the signal, and may retaliate with angry actions.	The message of anger is “get out of my way.” Anger can carry a message ranging from dissatisfaction to threat.								

Fear	Common signals are very wide open eyes, horizontally stretched lips and raised, drawn together eyebrows. There may be movement away from the target. Screams may accompany intense fear. Lesser fear signals can include heavy breathing, a head position slightly backwards and away, and horizontally stretched lips accompanied by tightened neck muscles.	The message of fear is “help me”; it can range from showing low-level concern to conveying panic.								

Disgust	There are three facial expressions associated with disgust. The first is sticking the tongue out as if the person is getting something out of their mouth. The second is raising the upper lip, but it is relaxed and not tense, which can display gums and teeth depending on the shape of the mouth. The third is wrinkling of the nose and raising of the nostrils. These expressions can occur separately or in unison.	The message of disgust is “get away from this.” It can show others that the target of disgust is to be kept away from or that the target is unclean, dirty or socially/morally reprehensible.								

Sadness	The signals of sadness include a frown (lower lip pushed up slightly and lip corners pulled slightly down), the inner corners of the eyebrows drawn up and together in the center of the forehead, raised cheeks and tears. The vocalization of sadness can include sobs and heaving and quavering of the voice.	The message of sadness is “comfort me.” It encourages, or intends to encourage, empathy from others.								

Enjoyment	Enjoyment signals include the Duchenne (authentic) smile, activation of a smile (lip corners pulled obliquely up), and activation of the orbital eye muscles that tighten the lower eyelid and create wrinkling around the outer eye corners (especially with age). Enjoyment also includes vocal signals such as the sound of relief (a sigh or exhalation) and the sound of amusement (laughter or giggling).	The message of enjoyment is “this feels good.” It encourages engaging in social interaction.								

										

										

Emotional Episode Timeline										

pre-condition	This describes the context or situations which may influence the way we enter the emotion. For example our pre-condition could be physiological: being hungry, tired or emotional: having had a very enjoyable or stressful day or coming out of a prior emotional episode.									

event	This describes a person, place, situation, image, thought, memory, smell, sound, taste or idea that we encounter from the outside world or from our own mind. We are constantly, automatically appraising, or assessing our inner and outer world. For example, when we hear a new song, we are instantly overlaying our knowledge of instruments and categories of music as we listen without even thinking, this is automatic appraisal.									

trigger	This describes the combination of the automatic appraisal matching to some universal/hardwired or acquired script in our database.									

perception database	This describes our universal/hardwired responses and our individually acquired emotional memories. For example, if the event is a smell and in the database is the stored memory of the shampoo our mother used in our childhood, and we are triggered to experience an emotion of warm nostalgia of a happy childhood. When the appraised event resembles something in our database, it may be a highly accurate or could create a distorted perception of the trigger. For example if we had an intimidating experience with a police officer when we were young and we are pulled over as an adult we could misperceive the situation with a distorted sense of fear.									

physical changes	This describes the autonomic changes in our body which occur as our emotion arises. We can experience these changes as sensations in our body, feeling heat in our face, tightness in our jaw or shoulders, etc.									

state	This describes the emotion itself, inclusive of physical and psychological changes.									

psychological changes	This describes the qualitative experience of the emotion, how sadness feels sad, or anger feels angry.									

action	This describes our emotional responses. This could be an external behavior such as yelling in anger, or could be internal, such as suppressing anger. Each emotion in the atlas shows a range of immediate actions, as well as intrinsic or intention actions. The action can be either constructive or destructive. Leading to further collaboration with others or to difficulty in collaborating.									

post-condition	This describes the result or impact of our emotional actions. This could be external: if we have yelled at someone they may then yell back; or internal: if we have suppressed we could be feeling some ongoing irritation. The post condition could lead to our next episode of emotion, if someone is yelling back at us we are triggered once again to either anger, fear or sadness/ regret for our actions. Our post condition is an opportunity for us to build emotional awareness through reflection on our emotion, to understand the trigger, identify the felt experience and consider its impact it has had.									

selective filter period	The Selective Filtering Period is initiated with the onset of actions and signals — perception is narrowed and distorted, filtering and interpreting information relevant to and consistent with the prevailing emotion. For example, when fear is aroused, there is a heightened sensitivity to real and imagined threats.									

										

Moods										

Moods are longer-lasting cousins of an emotion that cause us to feel the related emotion repeatedly without any clear trigger.										

Irritable	Predisposed to becoming angry, easily provoked.									

Apprehensive	Anxious that something bad will happen, on edge.									

Sour	Generally repulsed.									

Dysphoric (or feeling blue)	An enduring feeling of discouragement or disappointment.									

Elated	A long-lasting, generalized good feeling.									

Personality Trait										

Certain personality traits are related to specific emotions.										

										

Love	A strong attachment to another person, typically parent toward child and child toward parent, but also between those romantically committed. Within loving relationships, anger, fear, sadness, disgust and enjoyment can all be experienced.									

Surprise	The briefest emotion, surprise is triggered by the sudden occurrence of an unexpected event. It is often a way station that leads, after more appraisal, to any of the other emotions.									

Jealousy	An emotional storyline involving three people: the desired person, the person afraid of losing the commitment of the desired person, and the rival. During jealousy, anger, fear, disgust, sadness or surprise may be felt by any of the three people.									

Envy	Although often misused as a synonym for jealousy, envy involves resenting and wanting what another person possesses. When a person feels envy, anger, contempt or sadness may also be felt.									

Hate	Enduring anger focused on a particular person or group of persons. Over time hatred may generate the personality trait of hostility.									

Embarrassment	Self-conscious distress or awkwardness. Often activated by praise from another, or by a faux pas. It has no vocal signal, but may cause a blush that is visible only in light-skinned people.									

Shame	An expectation that others would be disgusted if they knew what the person was thinking of or had done. It motivates a strong wish to prevent others from learning what the person has done or thought.									

Contempt	The last emotion to appear in child development, it is a feeling of moral superiority to the target. Often mixed with enjoyment.									

Guilt	Regret about a past action, which motivates the wish to confess the wrongful action, hoping for forgiveness.

VALUED	Emotional Episode Timeline									

Accepted Cherished Favored	pre-condition	This describes the context or situations which may influence the way we enter the emotion. For example our pre-condition could be physiological: being hungry, tired or emotional: having had a very enjoyable or stressful day or coming out of a prior emotional episode.								

Belonging Loved Understood	event	This describes a person, place, situation, image, thought, memory, smell, sound, taste or idea that we encounter from the outside world or from our own mind. We are constantly, automatically appraising, or assessing our inner and outer world. For example, when we hear a new song, we are instantly overlaying our knowledge of instruments and categories of music as we listen without even thinking, this is automatic appraisal.								

Included Revered Appreciated	trigger	This describes the combination of the automatic appraisal matching to some universal/hardwired or acquired script in our database.								

Respected Wanted Desired	perception database	This describes our universal/hardwired responses and our individually acquired emotional memories. For example, if the event is a smell and in the database is the stored memory of the shampoo our mother used in our childhood, and we are triggered to experience an emotion of warm nostalgia of a happy childhood. When the appraised event resembles something in our database, it may be a highly accurate or could create a distorted perception of the trigger. For example if we had an intimidating experience with a police officer when we were young and we are pulled over as an adult we could misperceive the situation with a distorted sense of fear.								

Worshiped Adored Idolized	physical changes	This describes the autonomic changes in our body which occur as our emotion arises. We can experience these changes as sensations in our body, feeling heat in our face, tightness in our jaw or shoulders, etc.								

Admired Desirable Validated	state	This describes the emotion itself, inclusive of physical and psychological changes.								

	psychological changes	This describes the qualitative experience of the emotion, how sadness feels sad, or anger feels angry.								

Loving	action	This describes our emotional responses. This could be an external behavior such as yelling in anger, or could be internal, such as suppressing anger. Each emotion in the atlas shows a range of immediate actions, as well as intrinsic or intention actions. The action can be either constructive or destructive. Leading to further collaboration with others or to difficulty in collaborating.								

Affectionate Adoring Enchanted	post-condition	This describes the result or impact of our emotional actions. This could be external: if we have yelled at someone they may then yell back; or internal: if we have suppressed we could be feeling some ongoing irritation. The post condition could lead to our next episode of emotion, if someone is yelling back at us we are triggered once again to either anger, fear or sadness/ regret for our actions. Our post condition is an opportunity for us to build emotional awareness through reflection on our emotion, to understand the trigger, identify the felt experience and consider its impact it has had.								

Attracted Desirous Infatuated	selective filter period	The Selective Filtering Period is initiated with the onset of actions and signals — perception is narrowed and distorted, filtering and interpreting information relevant to and consistent with the prevailing emotion. For example, when fear is aroused, there is a heightened sensitivity to real and imagined threats.								

Fond Horny Passionate	Learned display rules (to regulate signals) and learned feeling rules (to modify, amplify or suppress subjective feelings) arise. We don’t know how quickly these occur. Do they occur before signals and actions, or immediately during the onset of signals and actions? Impulses are translated into actions and signals.									

Longing Lustful	The gap between Step 2 (impulses) and Step 4 (actions/signals) is variable, depending on the individual characteristics of each person and the person’s emotional profile, the intensity of the appraised trigger, and the momentary psychological state of the individual when the trigger is appraised (how much sleep the person had last night; what, if any, emotion the person last experienced or is currently experiencing, etc.).									

Y earning Aroused										

										

	10 THINGS TO REMEMBER									

	1 Social factors mean that we often fail to notice positive									

	emotions.									

	2 Long-term love is quite different from limerence – the									

	obsessive absorption of romantic love.									

	3 The three main dimensions of long-term love are intimacy,									

	passion and commitment.									

	4 The ‘ fi ght or fl ight ’ response is extreme arousal producing a									

	short-term increase in energy through various bodily changes.									

	5 The words we use to describe or defi ne emotions may also									

	help or hinder us in dealing with them.									

	6 The Yerkes-Dodson Law suggests that arousal can improve									

	performance up to a point, but after that will hinder it.									

	7 Coping strategies are ways of tackling long-term stress, often									

	using cognitive methods.									

	8 It is psychologically healthier to have an internal rather than									

	external locus of control, and a signifi cant way of reducing									

	stress.									

	9 Positive psychology is concerned with the pursuit of happiness									

	and other positive emotions.									

	10 Learned optimism is psychologically healthier than pessimism									

	or learned helplessness.
