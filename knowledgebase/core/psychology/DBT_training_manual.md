*When I teach my graduate students—who work with complex,  difficult-to-treat individuals at high risk for suicide—I always  remind them that they can choose whether to look out for themselves  or to look out for their clients, but they cannot always do both.  If they want to look out for themselves at a possible cost to their  clients, I remind them that they are in the wrong profession.*

*the-box” research treating individuals at extremely high risk for  suicide. Their willingness to allow such high-risk research when  other universities likely would not sets an example for others—and  made this book possible.*

Preface

The original edition of this skills training manual  was published in 1993\. At that time, the only re search conducted on Dialectical Behavior Therapy  (DBT) was a 1991 clinical trial comparing DBT to  treatment as usual for the treatment of chronically  suicidal individuals meeting criteria for borderline  personality disorder (BPD). Since then, an enor mous amount of research has been conducted on  “standard” DBT, which typically consists of DBT  individual therapy, group skills training, telephone  coaching, and a therapist consultation team. Re search has also been conducted on stand-alone DBT  skills training, and on the behavioral practices that  together make up the DBT skills. The new skills in  this edition are a product of my experience and re search using the original skills; the wide-ranging re search on emotions, emotion regulation, distress tol erance, and mindfulness, as well as new findings in  the social sciences; and new treatment strategies de veloped within the cognitive-behavioral paradigm.  The major changes in the revised skills package are  described below. 

Skills for Multiple Disorders  and Nonclinical Populations 

The original skills training manual was focused en tirely on treating clients with high risk for suicide  and BPD. This was primarily because the research  on DBT, including DBT skills, had been conduct ed with clients meeting criteria for BPD and for  high suicide risk. Since the first edition, however,  a number of studies have been conducted focusing  on skills training with different populations. For  example, DBT skills training has been shown ef fective with eating disorders,1, 2 treatment-resistant  depression,3, 4 and a variety of other disorders.5 In    
my colleagues’ and my research, increases in use of  skills mediates reductions in suicide attempts, non suicidal self-injury, difficulties regulating emotions,  and interpersonal problems.6 A subset of skills was  also added to a treatment for problem drinkers and  improved outcomes compared to a treatment with out the skills.7 A subset of DBT skills is taught in  the evidence-based National Education Alliance for  Borderline Personality Disorder’s Family Connec tions program for family members of individuals  with BPD. The entire set of core skills is taught in  the friends and families skills groups at the Universi ty of Washington Behavioral Research and Therapy  Clinics, which consist of individuals who want to  learn skills for coping with and accepting individu als in their lives who are difficult. This could in clude friends or relatives with serious mental health  problems, employees with problematic colleagues  and/or managers, managers with problematic em ployees, and therapists treating very difficult client  populations. Corporate consultants are looking at  DBT skills as a way to improve corporate morale  and productivity. New sets of specialized skills have  been developed for specific disorders, including a  module targeting emotion overcontrol,8 middle path  skills developed originally for parents and adoles cents but appropriate for many populations,9 skills  for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and a  set of skills specifically designed for individuals with  addictions. DBT skills lesson plans are now being  used in school systems to teach middle school and  high school students,10 are working their way into  programs focused on resilience, and can be applied  across work settings. DBT skills are widely taught in  general mental health programs in community men tal health, inpatient, acute care, forensic, and many  other settings. In sum, there are substantial data  

vii   
viii  •  **Preface** 

and clinical experience suggesting that DBT skills  are effective across a wide variety of both clinical  and nonclinical populations and across settings. 

Of course, it should not come as a surprise that  DBT skills are widely applicable. I developed many  of the skills by reading treatment manuals and treat ment literature on evidence-based behavioral inter ventions. I then looked to see what therapists told  patients to do for each problem, repackaged those  instructions in skills handouts and worksheets, and  wrote teaching notes for therapists. For example, for  the skill “opposite action” (see Chapter 9\) for fear,  I repackaged exposure-based treatments for anxi ety disorders in simpler language. I also applied the  same principles of change across other disordered  emotions. “Check the facts” is a core strategy in  cognitive therapy interventions. DBT skills are what  behavior therapists tell clients to do across many ef fective treatments. Some of the skills are entire treat ment programs formulated as a series of steps. The  new “nightmare protocol,” an emotion regulation  skill, is an example of this. The mindfulness skills  are a product of my 18 years in Catholic schools, my  training in contemplative prayer practices through  the Shalem Institute’s spiritual guidance program,  and my 34 years as a Zen student and now as a Zen  master. Other skills came from basic behavioral sci ence and research in cognitive and social psycholo gy. Some came from colleagues developing new DBT  skills for new populations. 

New Skills in This Edition 

There are still four primary DBT skills training  modules: mindfulness skills, interpersonal effective ness skills, emotion regulation skills, and distress  tolerance skills. Within these modules, I have added  the following new skills. 

**1\.** In **mindfulness skills** (Chapter 7), I have added  a section on teaching mindfulness from alternative  perspectives, including a spiritual perspective. 

**2\.** In **interpersonal effectiveness skills** (Chapter 8),  I have added two new sections. The first focuses on  skills for finding and building relationships you want  and ending relationships you don’t want. The second  focuses on balancing acceptance and change in inter 

personal interactions. It closely duplicates the skills  Alec Miller, Jill Rathus, and I developed for adoles cent multifamily skills training, in which parents of  adolescent clients also participate in skills training.11 **3\.** The **emotion regulation skills** (Chapter 9\)  

have been expanded greatly and also reorganized.  The number of emotions described in detail has ex panded from six to ten (adding disgust, envy, jeal ously, and guilt). A section on changing emotional  responses adds two new skills: check the facts and  problem solving. Also in that section, the opposite  action skill has been extensively updated and ex panded. Skills for reducing emotional vulnerability  have been reorganized into a set of skills called the  ABC PLEASE skills. In the section on accumulat ing positive emotions, I changed the Pleasant Events  Schedule (now called the Pleasant Events List) to be  appropriate for both adolescent and adult clients. I  also added a values and priorities handout that lists  a number of universal values and life priorities. An other new skill, cope ahead, focuses on practicing  coping strategies in advance of difficult situations.  Optional nightmare and sleep hygiene protocols are  also included. Finally, a new section is added for rec ognizing extreme emotions (“Identify Your Personal  Skills Breakdown Point”), including steps for using  

crisis survival skills to manage these emotions. **4\.** The **distress tolerance skills** (Chapter 10\) now  start with a new STOP skill—stop, take a step back,  observe, and proceed mindfully—adapted from the  skill developed by Francheska Perepletchikova, Seth  Axelrod, and colleagues.12 The crisis survival sec tion now includes a new set of skills aimed at chang ing body chemistry to rapidly regulate extreme  emotions (the new TIP skills). A new set of skills fo cused on reducing addictive behaviors has also been  added: dialectical abstinence, clear mind, commu nity reinforcement, burning bridges, building new  ones, alternate rebellion, and adaptive denial. **5\.** Across modules I have also made a number of  changes. Every module now starts with goals for  that module along with a goals handout and a corre sponding pros and cons worksheet. The worksheet is  optional and can be used if the client is unwilling or  ambivalent about practicing the skills in the module. A mindfulness skill has been added to both the  interpersonal module (mindfulness of others) and  the distress tolerance module (mindfulness of cur rent thoughts). Together with mindfulness of cur rent emotion (emotion regulation), these additions  are aimed at keeping the thread of mindfulness alive  across time. 

More Extensive Teaching Notes 

Many people who have watched me teach DBT skills  have commented that most of what I actually teach 

was not included in the first edition of this book. In  this second edition, I have added much more infor mation than was in the previous one. First, as much  as possible I have included the research underpin nings for the skills included. Second, I have provided  a very broad range of different teaching points that  you can choose from in teaching, far more points  than either you or I could possibly cover in a skills  training class. The teaching notes may, at first, seem  overwhelming. It is important to remember that this  book is not to be read cover to cover at one sitting.  Instead, teaching notes are organized by specific  skills so that when teaching a specific skill you can  find the notes just for that skill or set of skills. It  will be important for you to read over the material  for the skills you plan to teach and then highlight  just those points that you wish to make when teach ing. With practice over time, you will find that you  expand your teaching to include different parts of  the material. You will also find that some parts of  the material fit some of your clients and other parts  fit other clients. The material is meant to be used  flexibly. With experience, you will no doubt start  adding your own teaching points. 

More Clinical Examples 

A larger number of clinical examples are also in cluded in this second edition. Examples are essential  for good teaching. However, you should feel free to  modify the examples provided and to substitute new  ones to meet the needs of your clients. In fact, this  is the major difference in teaching skills for various  populations; one set of examples may be needed for  clients with high emotion dysregulation and impulse  control difficulties, another for those with emotion  overcontrol, and another for substance-dependent  clients. Differences in culture, ethnicity, nationality,  socioeconomic status, and age may each necessitate  different sets of examples. In my experience, it is the  examples but not the skills that need to be changed  across populations. 

More Interactive Handouts    
and Optional Handouts 

Many of the handouts have been modified to allow  greater interaction during skills training sessions.  Most have check boxes so participants can check  items of importance to them or skills they are will 

ing to practice in the coming weeks. Each module  also now includes a number of optional handouts.    
**Preface**  •  ix 

These have the same number as the core handout  with which they are associated plus a letter (e.g., 1a,  1b). These optional handouts can be given out and  taught to participants, given out but not formally  taught, used by the skills trainer to teach but not  given out, or simply ignored if not viewed as useful.  My experience is that these optional handouts are  extremely useful for some groups and individuals  but not for others. 

Improved Worksheets 

By popular demand, homework sheets have been  relabeled worksheets. Also, on each handout the  corresponding worksheets are listed, and on each  worksheet the corresponding handouts are listed. 

There are now multiple alternative worksheets as sociated with many of the handouts. The increase  in worksheets is due to a number of factors. First,  it became clear over the years that a worksheet that  works very well for one person may not be good for  another person. As a result, I have developed a range  of worksheets for each handout. For most skills sec tions, there is one set of worksheets that covers the  skills in the entire section. This is for clients who are  unlikely to complete much homework practice and  can help those who have already completed skills  training and are now working on maintaining their  practice of skills.  

Second, different clients like different types of  practice. There are clients who want to check off  what homework they have done, clients who prefer  to describe their homework and rate its effective 

ness, and those who like to write diaries describ ing what they have done and how it affected them.  I have found it most effective to let clients choose  worksheets to fill out from a set. 

Multiple Teaching    
Schedules Outlined 

The 1993 edition of the skills manual included the  specific skills and worksheets that were used in the  first randomized clinical trial of DBT. At that time,  DBT had not spread very far, and there were not  many examples of how to choose skills for situa 

tions in which some but not all of the skills could  be taught, nor were skills developed at that time for  special populations such as adolescents or individu als with addictions, eating disorders, and so forth.  Given the many new skills in this edition, it is not  possible to teach all the skills in a 24-week skills   
x  •  **Preface** 

group, even when the skills are repeated for a sec ond 24 weeks, as in a 1-year DBT treatment pro gram. This edition includes a number of schedules  for teaching skills, including schedules for 1-year,  6-month, and briefer skills training in acute care  units and nontraditional settings. Schedules for par ticular populations (such as adolescents and sub stance abusers) are also provided. As often as pos sible, the teaching schedules are based on clinical  trials that showed that the specific skills schedule  was effective. With this in mind, there are now sev eral sets of core DBT skills that are outlined in the  appendices to Part I. My general strategy in teaching  skills is to give participants all the DBT handouts  and worksheets. I then follow a teaching schedule I  determine based on the population, the number of  weeks of treatment, and current research. Along the  way, I tell participants that if we have time I will  teach them other skills—if they talk me into it. 

A Word about Terms 

There are many terms for a person who teaches and  coaches behavioral skills: therapist, psychothera pist, individual therapist, marital therapist, family  therapist, milieu therapist, group therapist, group  leader, counselor, case manager, skills trainer, be havioral coach, skills coach, crisis worker, mental  health worker, mental health care provider, and so  on. In this manual, the term “therapist” refers to  a person who is providing psychotherapy or other  mental health services. In standard DBT, this would  be the person’s individual therapist. The terms  “skills trainer,” “skills leader,” “skills co-leader,”  and “leader” refer to individuals who are providing  skills training either individually or in a group. In  standard DBT, this refers to the group skills leaders.  On occasion I use the term “provider” as a general  reference to any person providing health care ser vices.

Acknowledgments

There is truly something magical about being a uni versity professor. Students arrive excited but often  with threadbare knowledge, and before you know  it they have not only climbed on your shoulders  but have built a ladder from there reaching to the  sky. I have been enormously privileged to have had  many such students and postdoctoral fellows in my  research clinic while I wrote this book. They have  read countless versions of the skills presented here  and tried out new skills, correcting, improving, and  throwing them out as they went. They have radical 

ly accepted canceled meetings and frantic requests  to find missing references, rearrange entire refer ence lists, and find research I knew I had read but  could not locate to save my soul. They have helped  me early in the day, at night, and when I called on  weekends. They have stayed by my side even though  my door said: “Do Not Disturb: Please Do Not Ig nore This Message\!” Although I am sure that I have  missed some names here (please let me know for the  next printing), I want especially to thank the follow ing students and former students, now colleagues:  Milton Brown, Linda Dimeff, Safia Jackson, Alis sa Jerud, Anita Lungu, Ashley Maliken, Lyndsey  Moran, Andrada Neacsiu, Shireen Rizvi, Cory  Secrist, Adrianne Stevens, Stephanie Thompson,  Chelsey Wilks, and Brianna Woods; and fellows  and former fellows, now colleagues: Alex Chap man, Eunice Chen, Melanie Harned, Erin Miga,  Marivi Navarro, and Nick Salman. Many others  have jumped in when asked: colleagues Seth Axel rod, Kate Comtois and her entire DBT team, Sona  Dimidjian, Anthony Dubose, Thomas Lynch, Helen  McGowan, and Suzanne Witterholt. When I had  something controversial to say, I sent it to the DBT  strategic planning executive group (also known as  

the Linehan Institute Research Advisory Board) for  approval: Martin Bohus, Alan Fruzzetti, André Iva noff, Kathryn Korslund, and Shelley McMain. 

No one with multiple jobs and never-ending de mands on their time can get much done without  strong administrative help. I could not have gotten  this book done without the help of Elaine Franks,  my fabulous administrative assistant. She canceled  phone calls and meetings, said no before I could say  yes, called me at all hours—morning, noon, and  night—to see what I was doing and how I was pro gressing, and sent me repeated copies of things I had  lost. Thao Truong, our office and financial manag er, made sure that the whole place did not fall apart  while everyone was waiting on me to finish tasks  well beyond deadline. 

Much of what is in this manual I learned from  the many clients who participated in skills train ing groups that I have conducted over the years. I  am grateful to all those who put up with the many  versions that did not work or were not useful, and  to those among them who gave enough feedback  for me to make needed revisions in the skills being  taught. 

I want to thank Copyeditor Marie Sprayberry,  Editorial Project Manager Anna Brackett, Senior  Editor Barbara Watkins, Executive Editor Kitty  Moore, and the staff at The Guilford Press. In get 

ting this manual out in a timely fashion, they each  had occasion to practice all the distress tolerance  skills in this book. Their concern for the manuscript  and for this form of treatment was evident at every  step. Last, but certainly not least, I want to thank  my family: Nate and Geraldine, who supported me  at every step, and Catalina, who brought enough joy  to keep us all going.

An Introduction  to DBT Skills Training  
Chapter 1 

Rationale for Dialectical Behavior  Therapy Skills Training

What Is DBT? 

The behavioral skills training described in this man ual is based on a model of treatment called Dialecti cal Behavior Therapy (DBT). DBT is a broad-based  cognitive-behavioral treatment originally developed  for chronically suicidal individuals diagnosed with  borderline personality disorder (BPD). Consisting of  a combination of individual psychotherapy, group  skills training, telephone coaching, and a therapist  consultation team, DBT was the first psychotherapy  shown through controlled trials to be effective with  BPD.1 Since then, multiple clinical trials have been  conducted demonstrating the effectiveness of DBT  not only for BPD, but also for a wide range of other  disorders and problems, including both undercon trol and overcontrol of emotions and associated  cognitive and behavioral patterns. Furthermore, an  increasing number of studies (summarized later in  this chapter) suggest that skills training alone is a  promising intervention for a variety of populations,  such as persons with drinking problems, families of  suicidal individuals, victims of domestic abuse, and  others. 

DBT, including DBT skills training, is based on a  dialectical and biosocial theory of psychological dis order that emphasizes the role of difficulties in regu lating emotions, both under and over control, and  behavior. Emotion dysregulation has been linked  to a variety of mental health problems2 stemming  from patterns of instability in emotion regulation,  impulse control, interpersonal relationships, and  self-image. DBT skills are aimed directly at these  dysfunctional patterns. The overall goal of DBT  skills training is to help individuals change behav ioral, emotional, thinking, and interpersonal pat terns associated with problems in living. Therefore,  understanding the treatment philosophy and theo   
retical underpinnings of DBT as a whole is critical  for effective use of this manual. Such understand ing is also important because it determines thera pists’ attitude toward treatment and their clients.  This attitude, in turn, is an important component  of therapists’ relationships with their clients, which  are often central to effective treatment and can be  particularly important with suicidal and severely  dysregulated individuals. 

A Look Ahead 

This manual is organized into two main parts. Part  I (Chapters 1–5) orients readers to DBT and to DBT  skills training in particular. Part II (Chapters 6–10)  contains the detailed instructions for teaching the  specific skills. The client handouts and worksheets  for all of the skills modules can be found at a special  website for this manual (*www.guilford.com/skills* 

*training-manual*). They can be printed out for dis tribution to clients, and modified as necessary to fit  a particular setting. A separate, printed volume of  handouts and worksheets, ideal for client use, which  has its own website where clients can print their  

own forms, is also available for purchase. In the rest of this chapter, I describe the dialecti cal world view underpinning the treatment, and the  assumptions inherent in such a view. The biosocial  model of severe emotion dysregulation (including  BPD) and its development are then described, as  well as how variations on the model apply to dif ficulties in emotion regulation in general. As noted  above, the DBT skills presented in this manual are  specifically designed to address emotion dysregula tion and its maladaptive consequences. Chapter 1  concludes with a brief overview of the research on  standard DBT (individual psychotherapy, phone  

3   
4  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

coaching, consultation team, and skills training), as  well as the research on DBT skills training minus  the individual therapy component. In Chapters 2–5,  I discuss practical aspects of skills training: plan 

ning skills training, including ideas for different  skills curricula based on client population and the  setting (Chapter 2); structuring session format and  starting skills training (Chapter 3); DBT skills train 

ing treatment targets and procedures (Chapter 4);  and applying other DBT strategies and procedures  to behavioral skills training (Chapter 5). Together,  these chapters set the stage for deciding how to con 

duct skills training in a particular clinic or practice.  A set of Appendices to Part I consists of 11 different  curricula for skills training programs. 

In Part II, Chapter 6 begins the formal skills train ing component of DBT. It covers how to introduce  clients to DBT skills training and orient them to its  goals. Guidelines on how to teach specific skills then  follow, grouped into four skills modules: Mindful ness Skills (Chapter 7), Interpersonal Effective ness Skills (Chapter 8), Emotion Regulation Skills  (Chapter 9), and Distress Tolerance Skills (Chapter  10). 

Every skill has corresponding client handouts with  instructions for practicing that skill. Every handout  has at least one (usually more than one) associated  worksheet for clients to record their practice of the  skills. Again, all of these client handouts and work 

sheets can be found at the special Guilford website  for this manual (see above for the URL), as well as in  the separate volume. Descriptions of handouts and  related worksheets are given in boxes at the start of  each main section within the skill modules’ teaching  notes (Chapters 6–10). 

I should note here that all skills training in our  clinical trials was conducted in groups, although we  do conduct individual skills training in my clinic.  Many of the treatment guidelines in this manual  assume that skills training is being conducted in  groups, mainly because it is easier to adapt group  skills training techniques for individual clients than  vice versa. (The issue of group vs. individual skills  training is discussed at some length in the next  chapter.) 

This manual is a companion to my more complete  text on DBT, *Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of  Borderline Personality Disorder*.3 Although DBT  skills are effective for disorders other than BPD, the  principles underlying the treatment are still impor 

tant and are discussed fully there. Because I refer  to that book often throughout this manual, from  

here on I simply call it “the main DBT text.” The  scientific underpinnings and references for many of  my statements and positions are fully documented  in Chapters 1–3 of that text; thus I do not review or  cite them here again. 

The Dialectical World View    
and Basic Assumptions 

As its name suggests, DBT is based on a dialecti cal world view. “Dialectics” as applied to behavior  therapy has two meanings: that of the fundamen tal nature of reality, and that of persuasive dialogue  and relationship. As a world view or philosophical  position, dialectics forms the basis of DBT. Alterna tively, as dialogue and relationship, dialectics refers  to the treatment approach or strategies used by the  therapist to effect change. These strategies are de scribed in full in Chapter 7 of the main DBT text  

and are summarized in Chapter 5 of this manual. Dialectical perspectives on the nature of reality  and human behavior share three primary character istics. First, much as dynamic systems perspectives  do, dialectics stresses the fundamental interrelated ness or wholeness of reality. This means that a dia lectical approach views analyses of individual parts  of a system as of limited value unless the analysis  clearly relates the parts to the whole. Thus dialec tics directs our attention to the individual parts of  a system (i.e., one specific behavior), as well as to  the interrelatedness of the part to other parts (e.g.,  other behaviors, the environmental context) and to  the larger wholes (e.g., the culture, the state of the  world at the time). With respect to skills training,  a therapist must take into account first the interre latedness of skills deficits. Learning one new set of  skills is extremely difficult without learning other  related skills simultaneously—a task that is even  more difficult. A dialectical view is also compatible  with both contextual and feminist views of psycho pathology. Learning behavioral skills is particularly  hard when a person’s immediate environment or  larger culture do not support such learning. Thus  the individual must learn not only self-regulation  skills and skills for influencing his or her environ ment, but also when to regulate them. 

Second, reality is not seen as static, but as made  up of internal opposing forces (thesis and antithesis)  out of whose synthesis evolves a new set of oppos ing forces. A very important dialectical idea is that  all propositions contain within them their own op-

positions. As Goldberg put it, “I assume that truth  is paradoxical, that each article of wisdom contains  within it its own contradictions, that *truths stand  side by side*” (pp. 295–296, emphasis in original).4 

Dialectics, in this sense, is compatible with psy chodynamic conflict models of psychopathology.  Dichotomous and extreme thinking, behavior, and  emotions are viewed as dialectical failures. The indi vidual is stuck in polarities, unable to move to syn theses. With respect to behavioral skills training,  three specific polarities can make progress extreme ly difficult. The therapist must pay attention to each  polarity and assist each client in moving toward a  workable synthesis. 

The first of these polarities is the dialectic be tween the need for clients to accept themselves as  they are in the moment and the need for them to  change. This particular dialectic is the most funda mental tension in any psychotherapy, and the thera pist must negotiate it skillfully if change is to occur. 

The second is the tension between clients’ getting  what they need to become more competent, and  losing what they need if they become more compe tent. I once had a client in skills training who every  week reported doing none of the behavioral home work assignments and insisted that the treatment  was not working. When after 6 months I suggested  that maybe this wasn’t the treatment for her, she re ported that she had been trying the new skills all  along and they *had* helped. However, she had not let  me know about it because she was afraid that if she  showed any improvement, I would dismiss her from  skills training. 

A third very important polarity has to do with  clients’ maintaining personal integrity and validat ing their own views of their difficulties versus learn ing new skills that will help them emerge from their  suffering. If clients get better by learning new skills,  they validate their view that the problem all along  was that they did not have sufficient skills to help  themselves. They have not been trying to manipu late people, as others have accused them of doing.  They are not motivated to hurt others, and they  do not lack positive motivation. But the clients’  learning new skills may also seem to validate oth ers’ opinions in other ways: It may appear to prove  that others were right all along (and the client was  wrong), or that the client was the problem (not the  environment). Dialectics not only focuses the client’s  attention on these polarities, but also suggests ways  out of them. (Ways out are discussed in Chapter 7 of  the main DBT text.)   
**1\. Rationale for DBT Skills Training**  •  5 

The third characteristic of dialectics is an assump tion, following from the two characteristics above,  that the fundamental nature of reality is change  and process rather than content or structure. The  most important implication here is that both the in dividual and the environment are undergoing con tinuous transition. Thus therapy does not focus on  maintaining a stable, consistent environment, but  rather aims to help the client become comfortable  with change. An example of this is that we discour age people from sitting in exactly the same seats in  a skills training group for the whole time they are  in the group. Within skills training, therapists must  keep aware not only of how their clients are chang ing, but also of how they themselves and the treat ment they are applying are changing over time. 

Biosocial Theory: How Emotion  Dysregulation Develops\* 

As noted earlier, DBT was originally developed for  individuals who were highly suicidal, and second arily for individuals who met criteria for BPD. Effec tive treatment, however, requires a coherent theory.  My first task, therefore, was to develop a theory that  would let me understand the act of suicide, as well  as BPD. I had three criteria for my theory: It had  to (1) guide treatment implementation, (2) engender  compassion, and (3) fit the research data. The bio social theory I developed was based on the premise  that both suicide and BPD are, at their core, disor ders of emotion dysregulation. Suicidal behavior is a  response to unbearable emotional suffering. BPD is  a severe mental disorder resulting from serious dys regulation of the affective system. Individuals with  BPD show a characteristic pattern of instability in  affect regulation, impulse control, interpersonal re lationship, and self-image. 

\*The ideas discussed in this section on the biosocial theory  in general (and the DBT model of emotions in particular)  are not only drawn from the main DBT text, but also based  on the following: Neacsiu, A. D., Bohus, M., & Linehan,  M. M. (2014). Dialectical behavior therapy: An intervention  for emotion dysregulation. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), *Handbook  of emotion regulation* (2nd ed., pp. 491–507). New York:  Guilford Press; and Crowell, S. E., Beauchaine, T. P., &  Linehan, M. M. (2009). A biosocial developmental model of  borderline personality: Elaborating and extending Linehan’s  theory. *Psychological Bulletin*, *135*(3), 495–510. Neacsiu et  al. discuss emotion dysregulation as central to BPD and men tal disorder, and Crowell et al. present an elaboration and  extension of my original biosocial theory.  
6  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

Emotion dysregulation has also been related to a  variety of other mental health problems. Substance  use disorders, eating disorders, and many other de structive behavioral patterns often function as es capes from unbearable emotions. Theorists have  proposed that major depressive disorder should be  conceptualized as an emotion dysregulation disor der, based partly on a deficit in up-regulating and  maintaining positive emotions.5 Similarly, literature  reviews have demonstrated that anxiety disorders,  schizophrenia, and even bipolar disorders are di rectly linked to emotion dysregulation.6, 7 

*The DBT Model of Emotions* 

To understand emotion dysregulation, we have to  first understand what emotions actually are. Pro posing any definition of the construct “emotion,”  however, is fraught with difficulty, and there is rare ly agreement even among emotion researchers on  any one concrete definition. That being said, teach ing clients about emotions and emotion regulation  requires some attempt at a description of emotions,  if not an exact definition. DBT in general, and DBT  skills in particular, are based on the view that emo tions are brief, involuntary, full-system, patterned  responses to internal and external stimuli.8 Similar  to others’ views, DBT emphasizes the importance of  the evolutionary adaptive value of emotions in un derstanding them.9 Although emotional responses  are systemic responses, they can be viewed as con sisting of the following interacting subsystems: (1)  emotional vulnerability to cues; (2) internal and/ or external events that, when attended to, serve  as emotional cues (e.g., prompting events); (3) ap praisal and interpretations of the cues; (4) response  tendencies, including neurochemical and physiologi cal responses, experiential responses, and action  urges; (5) nonverbal and verbal expressive responses  and actions; and (6) aftereffects of the initial emo tional “firing,” including secondary emotions. It is  useful to consider the patterned actions associated  with emotional responses to be part and parcel of  the emotional responses rather than consequences  of the emotions. By combining all these elements  into one interactional system, DBT emphasizes that  modifying any component of the emotional system  is likely to change the functioning of the entire sys tem. In short, if one wants to change one’s own emo tions, including emotional actions, it can be done by  modifying any part of the system. 

*Emotion Dysregulation* 

Emotion dysregulation is the inability, even when  one’s best efforts are applied, to change or regu late emotional cues, experiences, actions, verbal  responses, and/or nonverbal expressions under nor mative conditions. Pervasive emotion dysregulation  is seen when the inability to regulate emotions oc curs across a wide range of emotions, adaptation  problems, and situational contexts. Pervasive emo tion dysregulation is due to vulnerability to high  emotionality, together with an inability to regulate  intense emotion-linked responses. Characteristics  of emotion dysregulation include an excess of pain ful emotional experiences; an inability to regulate  intense arousal; problems turning attention away  from emotional cues; cognitive distortions and fail ures in information processing; insufficient control  of impulsive behaviors related to strong positive and  negative affect; difficulties organizing and coordi nating activities to achieve non-mood-dependent  goals during emotional arousal; and a tendency to  “freeze” or dissociate under very high stress. It can  also present as emotion overcontrol and suppres sion, which leads to pervasive negative affect, low  positive affect, an inability to up-regulate emotions,  and difficulty with affective communication. Sys temic dysregulation is produced by emotional vul nerability and by maladaptive and inadequate emo tion modulation strategies. Emotional vulnerability  is defined by these characteristics: (1) very high neg ative affectivity as a baseline, (2) sensitivity to emo tional stimuli, (3) intense response to emotional  stimuli, and (4) slow return to emotional baseline  once emotional arousal has occurred.  

*Emotion Regulation* 

Emotion regulation, in contrast, is the ability to (1)  inhibit impulsive and inappropriate behavior related  to strong negative or positive emotions; (2) organize  oneself for coordinated action in the service of an  external goal (i.e., act in a way that is not mood 

dependent when necessary); (3) self-soothe any  physiological arousal that the strong emotion has  induced; and (4) refocus attention in the presence  of strong emotion. Emotion regulation can be auto 

matic as well as consciously controlled. In DBT, the  focus is first on increasing conscious control, and  second on eliciting sufficient practice to overlearn  skills such that they ultimately become automatic.

*Biological Vulnerabilities*    
*(the “Bio” in the Biosocial Theory)*10\* 

Dispositions to negative affectivity, high sensitivity  to emotion cues, and impulsivity are biologically  based precursors to emotion dysregulation. The  biological influences include heredity, intrauterine  factors, childhood or adulthood physical insults af 

fecting the brain, and the effects of early learning  experiences on both brain development and brain  functioning. A dysfunction in any part of the ex tremely complex human emotion regulation system  can provide the biological basis for initial emotional  vulnerability and subsequent difficulties in emotion  modulation. Thus the biological disposition may be  different in different people. 

Two dimensions of infant temperament, effortful  control and negative affectivity, are particularly rel evant here. Effortful control, which contributes to  both emotional and behavioral regulation, is a gen eral term for a number of self-regulation behaviors  (including inhibiting dominant responses to engage  in less dominant responses, planning, and detecting  errors in behavior). Children at risk for pervasive  emotion dysregulation and behavioral dyscontrol  are likely to be low on effortful control and high on  negative affectivity, which is characterized by dis comfort, frustration, shyness, sadness, and inability  to be soothed. 

*The Caregiving Environment*    
*(the “Social” in the Biosocial Theory)* 

The contributions of the social environment, par ticularly the family, include (1) a tendency to invali date emotions and an inability to model appropri ate expressions of emotion; (2) an interaction style  

that reinforces emotional arousal; and (3) a poor fit  between the child’s temperament and the caregiv ers’ parenting style. This final point is emphasized  here because it highlights the biology × environment  transactions that shape both child and caregiver be haviors. In theory, a child with low biological vul nerability may be at risk for BPD and/or high emo-

tion dysregulation if there is an extreme discrepancy  between child and caregiver characteristics, or if the  family’s resources are extremely taxed (e.g., by a  family member’s alcoholism or a sibling with can 

cer). Such situations have the potential to perpetuate  invalidation, because the demands of the child often  exceed the ability of the environment to meet those  demands. 

The converse is also likely: A biologically vulner able child may be resilient in a well-matched envi ronment where strong family supports are in place.  Such differential outcomes led me to propose three  primary types of families that increase risk for BPD:  the disorganized family (e.g., one that is pervasively  neglectful or maltreating); the perfect family (e.g.,  one where expressing negative emotions is taboo),  and the normal family (one characterized primar ily by poorness of fit). Importantly, caregiver char acteristics are not necessarily fixed or preexisting.  Rather, the caregiver is also a product of complex  biological, social, and psychological transactions,  including evocative effects of the child on parenting  style. 

The Role of the Invalidating Environment 

The role of invalidation in the development of emo tion dysregulation makes a lot of sense, once you re alize that a primary function of emotions in humans  (as well as other mammals) is to serve as a rapid  communication system. Invalidation of emotions  sends the message that the communication was not  received. When the message is important, the sender  understandably escalates the communication by es calating the emotion. When the receiver does not  “get” the communication or disbelieves it, he or she  understandably increases efforts to stop the com munication, usually by some means of invalidation.  And so it goes, around and around, escalating on  both sides until one side backs down. It is often the  receiver who finally stops and listens or gives in to  the demands of the highly emotional sender. Ergo,  escalation has been reinforced. When this continues  intermittently, the pattern of escalated emotion dys regulation is cemented. 

Such an environment is particularly damaging for  a child who begins life with high emotional vulnera bility. The emotionally vulnerable and reactive indi vidual elicits invalidation from an environment that  might have otherwise been supportive. A defining  characteristic of an invalidating environment is the   
8  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

tendency to respond erratically and inappropriately  to private experience (e.g., beliefs, thoughts, feel ings, sensations), and in particular to be insensitive  to private experience that does not have public ac companiments. Invalidating environments also tend  to respond in an extreme fashion (i.e., to over- or  underreact) to private experiences that do have pub lic accompaniments. Phenomenological, physiologi cal, and cognitive components of emotions are pro totypic private experiences that lead to invalidation  in these settings. To clarify the invalidating environ ment’s contribution to emotionally dysregulated be havioral patterns, let us contrast it to environments  that foster more adaptive emotion regulation skills. 

In the optimal family, public validation of private  experience is given frequently. For example, when a  child says, “I’m thirsty,” parents give him or her a  drink (rather than saying, “No, you’re not. You just  had a drink”). When a child cries, parents soothe  the child or attempt to find out what is wrong (rather  than saying, “Stop being a crybaby\!”). When a child  expresses anger or frustration, family members take  it seriously (rather than dismissing it as unimport ant). When the child says, “I did my best,” the par 

ent agrees (rather than saying, “No, you didn’t”).  And so on. In the optimal family, the child’s prefer ences (e.g., for color of room, activities, or clothes)  are taken into account; the child’s beliefs and  thoughts are elicited and responded to seriously; and  the child’s emotions are viewed as important com munications. Successful communication of private  experience in such a family is followed by changes  in other family members’ behavior. These changes  increase the probability that the child’s needs will be  met and decrease the probability of negative conse quences. Parental responding that is attuned and is  not aversive results in children who are better able  

to discriminate their own and others’ emotions. By contrast, an invalidating family is problematic  because the people in it respond to the communi cation of preferences, thoughts, and emotions with  nonattuned responses—specifically, with either  nonresponsiveness or extreme consequences. This  leads to an intensification of the differences between  an emotionally vulnerable child’s private experience  and the experience the social environment actually  supports and responds to. Persistent discrepancies  between a child’s private experience and what oth ers in the environment describe as the child’s experi ence provide the fundamental learning environment  necessary for many of the behavioral problems as sociated with emotion dysregulation. 

In addition to early failures to respond optimally,  an invalidating environment more generally empha sizes controlling emotional expressiveness, especial ly the expression of negative affect. Painful experi ences are often trivialized and attributed to negative  traits, such as lack of motivation, lack of discipline,  and failure to adopt a positive attitude. Strong posi tive emotions and associated preferences may be  attributed to other negative traits, such as lack of  judgment and reflection or impulsivity. Other char acteristics of the invalidating environment include  restricting the demands a child may make upon the  environment, discriminating against the child on  the basis of gender or other arbitrary characteristics,  and using punishment (from criticism up to physical  and sexual abuse) to control behavior. 

The invalidating environment contributes to emo tion dysregulation by failing to teach the child to  label and modulate arousal, to tolerate distress, or  to trust his or her own emotional responses as valid  interpretations of events. It also actively teaches  the child to invalidate his or her own experiences  by making it necessary for the child to scan the en vironment for cues about how to act and feel. By  oversimplifying the ease of solving life’s problems,  it fails to teach the child how to set realistic goals.  Moreover, by punishing the expression of negative  emotion and erratically reinforcing emotional com munication only after escalation by the child, the  family shapes an emotional expression style that  vacillates between extreme inhibition and extreme  disinhibition. In other words, the family’s usual re sponse to emotion cuts off the communicative func tion of ordinary emotions. 

Emotional invalidation, particularly of negative  emotions, is an interaction style characteristic of so cieties that put a premium on individualism, includ ing individual self-control and individual achieve ment. Thus, it is quite characteristic of Western  culture in general. A certain amount of invalidation  is, of course, necessary in raising a child and teaching  self-control. Not all communications of emotions,  preferences, or beliefs can be responded to in a posi tive fashion. The child who is highly emotional and  who has difficulty controlling emotional behaviors  will elicit from the environment (especially parents,  but also friends and teachers) the greatest efforts to  control the emotionality from the outside. Invalida tion can be quite effective at temporarily inhibiting  emotional expression. Invalidating environments,  however, have different effects on different children.  The emotion control strategies used in invalidating 

families may have little negative impact on children  who are physiologically well equipped to regulate  their emotions, or may even be useful to some such  children. However, such strategies are hypothesized  to have a devastating impact on emotionally vulner 

able children. 

This transactional view of the development of  pervasive emotion dysregulation generally should  not be used to diminish the importance of trauma  in the etiology of BPD and emotion dysregulation.  Researchers have estimated that up to 60–75% of  individuals with BPD have histories of childhood  trauma,11, 12 and many continue to experience fur 

ther trauma during adulthood.13, 14 In one study, re searchers found that 90% of inpatients with BPD re ported some experience of adult verbal, emotional,  physical, and/or sexual abuse, and that these rates  of adult abuse were significantly higher than those  reported by comparison participants with Axis II  disorders other than BPD.14 It is unclear, however,  whether the trauma in and of itself facilitates the  development of BPD and of high emotion dysregu lation patterns, or whether the trauma and the de velopment of the disorder both result from the ex tant familial dysfunction and invalidation. In other  words, the occurrence of victimization and emotion  regulation problems may arise from the same set of  developmental circumstances. 

*Development of Emotion*    
*Dysregulation: Summary* 

Emotion dysregulation in general, as well as the  dysregulation encountered in BPD specifically, is  an outcome of biological disposition, environmen tal context, and the transaction between the two  during development. The biosocial developmental  model proposes the following: (1) The development  of extreme emotional lability is based on character istics of the child (e.g., baseline emotional sensitiv ity, impulsivity), in transaction with a social context  that shapes and maintains the lability; (2) recipro cal reinforcing transactions between biological vul nerabilities and environmental risk factors increase  emotion dysregulation and behavioral dyscontrol,  which contribute to negative cognitive and social  outcomes; (3) a constellation of identifiable features  and maladaptive coping strategies develops over  time; and (4) these traits and behaviors may exacer bate risk for pervasive emotion dysregulation across  development, due to evocative effects on interper sonal relationships and social functioning, and via

interference with healthy emotional development.  This model is illustrated in Figure 1.1. 

The Consequences    
of Emotion Dysregulation 

Maccoby has argued that the inhibition of action is  the basis for the organization of all behavior.15 The  development of self-regulatory repertoires (as in ef fortful control, described above), especially the abil ity to inhibit and control affect, is one of the most  important aspects of a child’s development. The  ability to regulate the experience and expression of  emotion is crucial, because its absence leads to the  disruption of behavior, especially goal-directed be havior and other prosocial behavior. Alternatively,  strong emotion reorganizes or redirects behavior,  preparing the individual for actions that compete  with the nonemotionally or less emotionally driven  behavioral repertoire. 

The behavioral characteristics of individu als meeting criteria for a wide range of emotional  disorders, can be conceptualized as the effects of  emotion dysregulation and maladaptive emotion  regulation strategies. Impulsive behavior, and espe cially self-injurious and suicidal behaviors, can be  thought of as maladaptive but highly effective emo tion regulation strategies. For example, overdos ing usually leads to long periods of sleep, which in  turn reduce susceptibility to emotion dysregulation.  Although the mechanism by which self-mutilation  exerts affect-regulating properties is not clear, it is  very common for individuals engaging in such be havior to report substantial relief from anxiety and  other intense negative emotional states following  such acts. Suicidal behavior is also very effective in  eliciting helping behaviors from the environment,  which may be effective in avoiding or changing  situations that elicit emotional pain. For example,  suicidal behavior is generally the most effective way  for a nonpsychotic individual to be admitted to an  inpatient psychiatric unit. Suicide ideation, suicide  planning, and imagining dying from suicide, when  accompanied with a belief that pain will end with  death, can bring an intense sense of relief. Finally,  planning suicide, imagining suicide, and engaging in  a self-injurious act (and its aftereffects if it becomes  public) can reduce painful emotions by providing a  compelling distraction. 

The inability to regulate emotional arousal also  interferes with the development and maintenance

of a sense of self. Generally, one’s sense of self is  formed by observations of oneself and of others’ re actions to one’s actions. Emotional consistency and  predictability, across time and similar situations, are  prerequisites of identity development. Unpredictable  emotional lability leads to unpredictable behavior  and cognitive inconsistency, and consequently in terferes with identity development. The tendency of  dysregulated individuals to try to inhibit emotional  responses may also contribute to an absence of a  strong sense of identity. The numbness associated  with inhibited affect is often experienced as empti ness, further contributing to an inadequate and at  times completely absent sense of self. Similarly, if  an individual’s sense of events is never “correct” or  is unpredictably “correct”—the situation in an in validating environment—then the individual may be  

expected to develop an overdependence on others. Effective interpersonal relationships depend on  both a stable sense of self and a capacity for spontane ity in emotional expression. Successful relationships  also require a capacity for self-regulation of emotions  and tolerance of emotionally painful stimuli. With out such capabilities, it is understandable that indi viduals develop chaotic relationships. When emotion  dysregulation is pervasive or severe, it interferes with  a stable sense of self and with normal emotional ex pression. Difficulties controlling impulsive behaviors  and expressions of extreme negative emotions can  wreak havoc on relationships in many ways; in par ticular, difficulties with anger and anger expression  preclude the maintenance of stable relationships. 

Relationship of Emotion    
Dysregulation to DBT    
Skills Training16 

As noted above, many mental disorders can be con ceptualized as disorders of emotion regulation, with  deficits in both up- and down-regulation. Once you  realize that emotions include both actions and ac tion tendencies, you can see the link between emo tion dysregulation and many disorders defined as  behavior dyscontrol (e.g., substance use disorders).  DBT skills are aimed directly at these dysfunctional  patterns. 

First, dysregulation of the sense of self is common  in individuals with severe emotion dysregulation. In  both depression and BPD, for example, it is not un usual for individuals to report having no sense of a  self at all, feeling empty, and not knowing who they    
**1\. Rationale for DBT Skills Training**  •  11 

are. Feelings of being disconnected from others, of  contempt for self, and of invalidity or worthlessness  are also common. In addition, individuals with high  emotion dysregulation often view reality through  the lens of their emotions, rather than the light of  reality as it is. Thus both judgmental responses and  distorted inferences, assumptions, and beliefs are  common sequelae. To address such dysregulation of  the sense of self, the first DBT skills training module  (Chapter 7\) aims to teach a core set of “mindful ness” skills—that is, skills having to do with the  ability to consciously experience and observe one 

self and surrounding events with curiosity and with out judgment; to see and articulate reality as it is;  and to participate in the flow of the present moment  effectively. To address the impact of high emotional ity, mindfulness skills also focuses on observing and  accurately describing internal and external present  events without judgment or distortion of reality.  Mindfulness skills are core to all subsequent skills,  and thus are reviewed at the beginning of each sub sequent skills module. 

Second, individuals with emotion dysregulation  often experience interpersonal dysregulation. For  example, they may have chaotic and intense rela tionships marked with difficulties. Nevertheless,  they may find it extremely hard to let go of such re lationships; instead, they may engage in intense and  frantic efforts to keep significant individuals from  leaving them. More so than most, these individu als seem to do well when they are in stable, posi tive relationships and to do poorly when they are  not in such relationships. Problems with anger and  jealousy can ruin intimate relationships and friend ships; envy and shame can lead to avoidance of oth ers. A highly anxious individual may need to have  a partner around all the time as a safety behavior.  In contrast, severe depression may cause difficulties  connecting or engaging in relationships. Thus an other DBT skills training module (Chapter 8\) aims  to teach interpersonal effectiveness skills. 

Third, difficulties with emotion dysregulation  are common in many disorders. These difficulties  include problems with recognizing emotions, with  describing and labeling emotions, with emotional  avoidance, and with knowing what to do when an  emotion is on the scene. Therefore, a third DBT  skills training module (Chapter 9\) aims to teach  these and other emotion regulation skills. 

Fourth, individuals with high emotion dysregula tion often have patterns of behavior dysregulation,  such as substance misuse, attempts to injure or kill   
12  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

themselves, and other problematic impulsive behav iors. Impulsive and suicidal behaviors are viewed  in DBT as maladaptive problem-solving behaviors  resulting from an individual’s inability to tolerate  emotional distress long enough to pursue potentially  more effective solutions. To counter these maladap 

tive problem-solving and distress tolerance behav iors, a fourth DBT skills training module (Chapter  10\) aims to teach effective, adaptive distress toler ance skills.

The Standard DBT    
Treatment Program 

DBT was originally created for high-risk, multiple diagnosis clients with pervasive, severe emotion dys regulation; the clinical problems presented by these  clients were complicated. It was clear from the be ginning that treatment had to be flexible and based  on principles, rather than tightly scripted with one  protocol to fit all clients. To give some clarity and  structure to the inherent flexibility built into the  treatment, DBT was constructed as a modular in tervention, with components that can be dropped  in and pulled out as the needs of each client and the  structure of the treatment dictate. 

*Treatment Functions* 

DBT clearly articulates the functions of treatment  that it is designed: (1) to enhance an individual’s  capability by increasing skillful behavior; (2) to im prove and maintain the client’s motivation to change  and to engage with treatment; (3) to ensure that  generalization of change occurs through treatment;  (4) to enhance a therapist’s motivation to deliver  effective treatment; and (5) to assist the individual  in restructuring or changing his or her environ ment in such a way that it supports and maintains  progress and advancement toward goals (see Figure  1.2). 

*Treatment Modes* 

To accomplish these functions effectively, treat ment is spread among a variety of modes: individual  therapy or case management, group or individual  skills training, between-session skills coaching,  and a therapist consultation team (see Figure 1.3).  Each of the modes has different treatment targets,  and also different strategies available for reaching  those targets. It is not the mode itself that is critical,  but its ability to address a particular function. For  example, ensuring that new capabilities are general 

ized from therapy to a client’s everyday life might  be accomplished in various ways, depending on the  setting. In a milieu setting, the entire staff might be  taught to model, coach, and reinforce use of skills;  in an outpatient setting, generalization usually oc 

curs through telephone coaching. The individual  therapist (who is always the primary therapist in  standard DBT), together with the client, is respon

sible for organizing the treatment so that all func tions are met. 

*DBT Skills Modules* 

The skills taught to clients reflect a key dialectic  described earlier—the need for clients to accept  themselves as they are, and the need for them to  change. Hence there are sets of acceptance skills  as well as change skills. For any problem encoun 

tered, effective approaches can include acceptance  as well as change (see Figure 1.4). Skills are further  divided into the four skills modules by the topics  they address: mindfulness, emotion regulation, in 

terpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance.  Each skills module is further divided into a series  of sections, and then further divided into a series of  separate skills that are ordinarily taught in sequence  but can also be pulled out separately for teaching  and review. Clients can work on a single skill or set  of skills at a time; this helps keep them from being  overwhelmed by all the things they need to learn  and change. Once clients have made progress in a  set of skills, they can incorporate those skills into  work on a new skills module. Some of the more  complex skills, such as the interpersonal assertive ness skills (i.e., the “DEAR MAN” skills described  in Chapter 8), are also made up of smaller parts to  increase comprehension and accessibility.

*Roles of Skills Trainer*    
*and Individual Therapist* 

As described earlier in this chapter, the theoretical  model on which DBT is based posits that a com bination of capability deficits and motivational  problems underlies emotion dysregulation. First,  individuals with severe and pervasive emotion dys regulation, including those with BPD, lack impor tant self-regulation, interpersonal, and distress toler ance skills. In particular, they are unable to inhibit  maladaptive mood-dependent behaviors, or to initi ate behaviors that are independent of current mood  and necessary to meet long-range goals. Second,  the strong emotions and associated dysfunctional  beliefs learned in the original invalidating environ ment, together with current invalidating environ ments, form a motivational context that inhibits the  use of any behavioral skills a person does have. The  person is also often reinforced for inappropriate and  dysfunctional behaviors. Therefore, attention needs  to be paid to increasing both a person’s repertoire  of skills and his or her motivation to employ those  skills. However, as my colleagues and I developed  this treatment approach, it quickly became apparent  that (1) behavioral skills training to the extent we be lieve necessary is extraordinarily difficult, if not im possible, within the context of a therapy oriented to  reducing the motivation to die and/or act in a highly

emotionally reactive fashion; and (2) sufficient at tention to motivational issues cannot be given in  a treatment with the rigorously controlled therapy  agenda needed for skills training. From this dilemma  was born the idea of splitting the therapy into two  components: one that focuses primarily on behav ioral skills training, and one that focuses primarily  on motivational issues (including the motivation to  stay alive, to replace dysfunctional behaviors with  

skillful behaviors, and to build a life worth living). The role of the skills trainer in standard outpa tient DBT with severely dysregulated clients is to  increase clients’ abilities by teaching DBT skills and  eliciting practice. The role of the individual thera pist is to manage crises and help a client to apply  the skills he or she is learning to replace dysfunc tional behaviors. The individual therapist provides  telephone coaching of skills to the client as needed.  Furthermore, as noted above and in Figure 1.3, an  integral component of standard DBT is the thera pist consultation team: Skills trainers and individual  therapists meet on a regular basis not only to sup port each other, but also to provide a dialectical bal ance for each other in their interactions with clients. Individual therapy for chronically suicidal in dividuals and others with severe disorders may be  needed for several reasons. First, with a group of  serious and imminently suicidal clients, it can at  times be extraordinarily difficult for the skills train ers to handle the crisis calls that might be needed.  The caseload is simply too large. Second, in a skills oriented group that meets only once a week, there is  not much time to attend to individual process issues  that may come up. Nor is there time to adequately  help each individual integrate the skills into his or  her life. Some clients need much more time than oth ers do on particular skills, and the need to adjust  the pace to the average needs makes it very likely  that without outside attention, individuals will fail  to learn at least some of the skills. 

What kind of individual psychotherapy works  best with skills training? Our research findings to  date are mixed. In our first study on the topic, we  found that skills training plus DBT individual ther 

apy is superior to skills training plus non-DBT indi vidual therapy.17 In a second study, we tested skills  training plus a version of intensive case management  that may also be effective for some clients, whereas  for others standard DBT with DBT individual ther apy may be better.18 In DBT, “case management”  refers to helping the client manage his or her physi cal and social environment so that overall life func

tioning and well-being are enhanced, progress to ward life goals is facilitated, and treatment progress  is expedited.3 Clients’ individual therapists often  can serve as case managers, helping the clients to  interact with other professionals or agencies, as well  as to cope with problems of survival in the every day world. In this study, however, case management  replaced individual DBT therapy. In this version of  case management, caseloads were very small (six cli ents). Case managers met weekly with their teams;  used the DBT Suicidal Behavior Strategies Checklist  (see Chapter 5, Table 5.2); were available for phone  coaching of clients during work hours, and had ac cess to a community crisis line at other times; and  applied many of the acceptance elements of DBT  (validation, environmental intervention) that bal 

anced the change focus of many DBT skills. Therapists conducting skills training, however,  may not always have control over the type of indi vidual psychotherapy their clients get. This is espe cially likely in community mental health settings  and inpatient or residential units. In settings where  DBT is just being introduced, there may not be  enough DBT individual therapists to go around. Or  a unit may be trying to integrate different approach es to treatment. For example, a number of psychiat ric inpatient units have attempted an integration of  DBT skills training with individual psychodynamic  therapy. Acute inpatient units may structure psycho social treatment primarily around milieu and skills  training, with individual therapy consisting of sup portive therapy as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy.  The next chapter discusses issues for skills trainers  in managing non-DBT individual therapists. 

*Modifications of Cognitive and Behavior  Therapy Strategies in DBT* 

DBT as a whole and DBT skills training in particular  apply a broad array of cognitive and behavior ther apy strategies. Like standard cognitive-behavioral  therapy (CBT) programs, DBT emphasizes ongoing  assessment and data collection on current behaviors;  clear and precise definition of treatment targets; and  active collaboration between the therapist and the  client, including attention to orienting the client  to the intervention and obtaining mutual commit ment to treatment goals. Many components of DBT  (e.g., problem solving, skills training, contingency  management, exposure, and cognitive modification)  have been prominent in cognitive and behavior ther apies for years.  
16  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

Although DBT borrows many principles and pro cedures from standard cognitive and behavioral  therapies, the development and evolution of DBT  over time came about as I tried—and in many ways  failed—to get standard CBT to work with the popu lation of clients I was treating. Each modification I  made came about as I was trying to solve specific  problems I could not solve with the standard CBT  interventions available at the time. These modifica tions have led to DBT’s emphasizing 10 areas that,  though not new, had not previously received as  much attention in traditional CBT applications. The  treatment components that DBT has added to CBT  are listed below. Many, if not most, of these are now  common in many CBT interventions. 

**1\.** Synthesis of acceptance with change. **2\.** Inclusion of mindfulness as a practice for  therapists and as a core skill for clients. 

**3\.** Emphasis on treating therapy-interfering be haviors of both client and therapist. 

**4\.** Emphasis on the therapeutic relationship and  therapist self-disclosure as essential to thera py. 

**5\.** Emphasis on dialectical processes. 

**6\.** Emphasis on stages of treatment, and on tar geting behaviors according to severity and  threat. 

**7\.** Inclusion of a specific suicide risk assessment  and management protocol. 

**8\.** Inclusion of behavioral skills drawn primar ily from other evidence-based interventions. **9\.** The treatment team as an integral component  of therapy. 

**10\.** Focus on continual assessment of multiple  outcomes via diary cards. 

Whether these differences between DBT and stan dard CBT approaches are fundamentally important  is, of course, an empirical question. In any event,  CBT interventions have expanded their scope since  DBT first appeared, and components of DBT have  made their way into many standard interventions.  The differences between them and DBT have erod ed. This is most clearly evident in the increasing at tention to the synthesis of acceptance and change  and to the inclusion of mindfulness in many cur rent treatments (e.g., Mindfulness-Based Cognitive  Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy);  it can also be seen in the emphasis on attending  to in-session behaviors, particularly to therapy interfering behaviors (e.g., Functional Analytic Psy 

chotherapy). Although researchers to date have not  found that the therapeutic relationship necessarily  mediates outcomes in behavior therapy, the field as  a whole nonetheless puts a greater emphasis now on  developing and maintaining a collaborative inter 

personal relationship. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the  DBT strategies listed above, as well as how to apply  CBT strategies within DBT’s skills training context. 

Effectiveness of Standard DBT 

An overview of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  examining the effectiveness of standard DBT is pre sented in Table 1.2. As noted previously, standard  DBT includes individual DBT therapy, DBT skills  training, between-session coaching, and DBT team.  For updates on research go to the Linehan Institute  (*www.linehaninstitute.org/resources/fromMarsha*). 

*Standard DBT as a Treatment for BPD* 

There have now been a large number of studies  evaluating the effectiveness of standard DBT as a  treatment for high-risk individuals with severe and  complex mental disorders. Most but not all of this  research has focused on individuals meeting criteria  for BPD—primarily because individuals with BPD  have high rates of suicide and pervasive emotion  dysregulation, and ordinarily present with a com 

plex range of serious out-of-control behaviors. It is  just the complexity that arises from such dysregu lation that DBT was originally designed to treat.  At present DBT is the only treatment with enough  high-quality research to be evaluated as effective for  this population by the Cochrane Database of Sys tematic Reviews, a highly regarded independent re view group in Great Britain.19 

*Standard DBT as a Treatment*    
*for Suicidal Behaviors* 

In adults diagnosed with BPD and at risk for sui cide, standard DBT has yielded significantly high er improvements on measures of anger outbursts,  hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behav ior, as well as reduced admissions to emergency de partments and inpatient units for suicidality, when  compared to treatment as usual (TAU)1, 17, 20, 21, 22,  23, 24 and to treatment by community experts.23, 25 In the latter study, the expert therapists were nomi nated by mental health leaders in Seattle as the best

(nonbehavioral) therapists in the area. The aim of  the research was to find out whether DBT works be cause of its own unique characteristics or because  it is just a standard good therapy. In other words,  the question was “Are all treatments equal?” The  answer was “No.” In comparison to treatment by  community experts, DBT cut suicide attempts by  half, admissions to hospital emergency departments  for suicidality by half, and inpatient admissions for  suicidality by 73%. Bohus and colleagues obtained  similar findings for a 12-week inpatient DBT adap 

tation for females with BPD and a history of suicidal  behavior.26 More patients receiving DBT abstained  from self-injurious behaviors at posttreatment than  patients receiving TAU (62% vs. 31%). 

*Standard DBT as a Treatment for Mood  and Other Disorders* 

Among individuals meeting criteria for BPD, out comes across DBT studies indicate that DBT is an  effective treatment for a number of disorders other  than BPD. During 1 year of treatment, those in DBT  have improved significantly in reductions of depres sion, with remission rates from major depression  and substance dependence as good as those found  in evidence-based CBT and pharmacological in terventions.27 DBT participants also reported sig nificant improvements in developing a more positive  

introject (a psychodynamic construct we measured  to test the view that DBT only treats symptoms).  Those in DBT developed significantly greater self affirmation, self-love, and self-protection, as well as  less self-attack, during the course of treatment; they    
maintained these gains at a 1-year follow-up.42 DBT as a treatment for suicidality is not limited  to adults. Research with suicidal adolescents28, 29, 30 and suicidal college students31 has also found sig nificant reductions in use of psychotropic medica tions, depression, and suicidal behaviors, as well as  increases in life satisfaction, when DBT is compared  to control conditions. 

*Standard DBT as a General Treatment* 

Although DBT was originally developed for high risk, out-of-control individuals with complex diffi culties, the modular makeup of the treatment allows  therapists to “rev up” or “rev down” the number  of components actively used in treatment at a given  time. To date, adaptations of DBT have been shown  to be effective for posttraumatic stress disorder  (PTSD) due to childhood sexual abuse;32 eating  disorders comorbid with substance abuse;33 drug  dependence comorbid with BPD; 34, 35, 36 eating dis orders alone; 39, 40 Cluster B personality disorders;24 PTSD with and without comorbid BPD;41 and de pression in older adults.37, 38 Taken as a whole, these  

studies suggest that DBT is a broadly efficacious  treatment. 

This modular flexibility also allows us to bring  into the treatment new interventions and strategies  to replace old strategies that are less effective. Thus,  as time goes on, it is likely that the utility of DBT  will expand as the research base expands. 

DBT Skills Training    
as a Stand-Alone Treatment 

DBT skills training is rapidly emerging as a stand alone treatment. Although the majority of research  on DBT efficacy consists of clinical trials on stan dard DBT, many sites over the years have provided  DBT skills alone, usually because of insufficient  resources to provide the entire treatment. As these  programs multiplied, research to determine wheth er such programs provided effective treatment got  started. This growing area of research is suggest ing that skills training alone can be very effective in  many situations. 

*Evidence for the Effectiveness of DBT  Skills as a Stand-Alone Treatment* 

An overview of RCTs examining the effectiveness  of DBT skills training without individual therapy is  presented in Table 1.3. Additional non-RCT studies  examining the effectiveness of DBT skills alone are  presented in Table 1.4. 

As can be seen in Table 1.3, in clinical RCTs,  DBT skills training without concurrent individual  therapy has been found effective in a number of  areas. It was found to reduce depression in nine  separate studies;38, 42, 45, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54 anger in four  studies;43, 46, 52, 53 and emotion dysregulation,38, 51 

including affective instability43 and emotional in tensity,44 in four studies. Adaptations of DBT skills  have also been found to be an effective treatment  for eating disorders in three studies,39, 45, 46 as well  as for drinking-related problems51 and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).50 Among in carcerated women, DBT skills have been effective at  reducing PTSD symptoms, depression, and interper sonal problems.54 Among men and women in cor rectional facilities, DBT skills have been shown to  decrease aggression, impulsivity, and psychopathol ogy.55 Skills have also reduced intimate partner vio lence potential and anger expression among those  with histories of such violence. Among individuals    
**1\. Rationale for DBT Skills Training**  •  19 

in vocational rehabilitation with severe mental dis orders, DBT skills have decreased depression, hope lessness, and anger, and have increased number of    
hours working as well as job satisfaction.52 As can be seen in Table 1.4, studies of DBT skills  training in pre–post research designs (where there is  no control condition to which to compare outcomes)  have findings similar to the RCTs. These studies  have shown decreased depression 57, 58, 60, 61, 62 and  ADHD symptoms,61 as well as increased global  functioning60 and social adjustment coping.62 Three  studies have been conducted of DBT skills training  with families of troubled individuals,56, 57, 58 and  all three showed reduction in grief and a sense of  burden. Very few studies have been published of  skills training for children; however, in the case of  children with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD),  DBT skills training was associated with reductions  in externalizing and internalizing depression, a re duction in problematic behaviors, and an increase in  positive behaviors.60 

The majority of these studies offered only the  skills training component of DBT. Two exceptions  were presented by Lynch and colleagues.37 In the  first study, DBT skills and DBT phone coaching  were added to antidepressants and compared to an 

tidepressants alone for an elderly, depressed sample.  In the second study, standard DBT with medication  was compared to medication alone for an elderly,  depressed sample with comorbid personality dis 

orders. In both studies, the authors found that the  depression remitted much faster when individuals  were treated with DBT and medication than when  they were treated with medication alone 

The eating disorder studies used skills-only adap tations of DBT. Several of these studies did not re port which DBT skills they used, making it difficult  to determine which skills were important in bring ing about clinical change. Although skills training  has been linked to the reduction of emotion dys regulation in general,63 we will need more research  to determine exactly which skills are necessary and  which can be discarded. 

The next chapter addresses key issues in planning  to conduct skills training, including suggestions for  planning a skills training curriculum.

Planning to Conduct DBT Skills Training 

Behavioral skills training is necessary when the  skills needed to solve problems and attain desired  goals are not currently in an individual’s behav ioral repertoire. That is, under ideal circumstances  (where behavior is not interfered with by fears,  conflicting motives, unrealistic beliefs, etc.), the in dividual cannot generate or produce the behaviors  required. The term “skills” in DBT is used synony mously with “abilities” and includes in its broadest  sense cognitive, emotional, and overt behavioral (or  action) skills together with their integration, which  is necessary for effective performance. Effectiveness  is gauged by both direct and indirect effects of the  behaviors. Effective performance can be defined as  those behaviors that lead to a maximum of positive  outcomes with a minimum of negative outcomes.  Thus “skills” is used in the sense of “using skillful  means,” as well as in the sense of responding to situ ations adaptively or effectively. 

The emphasis on integration of behaviors to pro duce a skillful response is important. Very often  (indeed, usually), an individual has the component  behaviors of a skill but cannot put them together  coherently when necessary. For example, an inter personally skillful response requires putting togeth er words the person already knows into effective  sentences, together with appropriate body language,  intonation, eye contact, and so forth. The parts are  rarely new; the combination, however, often is. In  the terminology of DBT, almost any desired behav ior can be thought of as a skill. Thus coping actively  and effectively with problems, and avoiding mal adaptive or ineffective responses, are both consid ered using one’s skills. The central aim of DBT as a  whole is to replace ineffective, maladaptive, or non skilled behavior with skillful responses. The aim of  DBT skills training is to help the individual acquire  the needed skills. The steps for planning to conduct  DBT skills training are outlined in Table 2.1 and  

discussed in more detail next. How to integrate  DBT skills into non-DBT interventions is described  at a later point in the chapter. 

Forming (or Joining) a DBT Team1 

DBT assumes that effective treatment, including  skills training, must pay as much attention to the  behavior and experience of providers working with  clients as it does to the clients’ behavior and experi 

ence. Thus treatment of the providers is an integral  part of any DBT program. This is just as important  for those teaching skills as it is for all other DBT  providers. No matter how well adjusted clients may  be, skills training can at times be enormously chal 

lenging and/or stressful, and staying within the DBT  frame can be difficult. The roles of consultation are  to hold the providers within the DBT frame and to  address problems that arise. The fundamental team  targets relevant to skills trainers are increasing ad 

herence to DBT principles and accuracy of teaching

and coaching skills; providing ideas for enhancing  teaching of skills; troubleshooting problems that  arise in the course of skills training; increasing and  maintaining skills trainers’ motivation; and giving  support when providers’ limits are crossed (and even  when these are not crossed\!). 

DBT consultation groups require at least two  people who meet weekly in person if both are in the  same locality; when in-person meetings are not pos sible, team members may meet in an online learning  community or via Internet applications. Because the  primary focus of a DBT team is on the treatment  providers, *not* the skills training recipients, provid ers do not have to be treating the same clients. For  example, a client could be in individual treatment in  one clinic and in a skills training group taking place  in another clinic, each clinic with its own DBT team.  Coordination of interventions, however, is greater  if individual therapists, case managers, pharmaco therapists, and skills trainers are on the same team.  (See Sayrs & Linehan, in press, for more discussion  of how to set up, run, and solve problems in a DBT  consultation team.2) 

Selecting Skills Training Members  of Your Team: Necessary  

Qualifications and Characteristics 

Skills training can be conducted by psychothera pists, counselors, case managers, social workers,  milieu staff (in residential settings), and psychiatric  nurses (in inpatient settings). Prescribing psychia trists and nurse practitioners can be very effective  skills coaches. For individuals without identified  mental disorders, skills training can also be con ducted by anyone (teachers, parents, family mem bers, volunteers, and professional trainers) who is  well trained in the principles of skills training and  in the skills themselves. Clergy, pharmacotherapists,  and other health care providers (e.g., psychiatrists,  physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, occupation al therapists, and other medical staff in outpatient  settings), when trained in the skills, often make ex cellent skills coaches. In addition, charismatic in dividuals who themselves have gone through skills  training and have overcome their own difficulties  can also make excellent co-trainers and skills peer  

counselors, again, when trained in the skills. We know in DBT that to do the treatment effec tively, skills trainers need to be well trained in what  they are doing. They must have a very good grasp of  DBT skills, practice the skills themselves, and know  

how to teach them. They need to know and be able  to use basic behavior therapy techniques (such as be havior analysis, solution analysis, contingency man agement, exposure procedures, and the basics of  skills building) and DBT treatment strategies (such  as dialectical strategies, validation and problem solving strategies, irreverent and reciprocal com munication strategies, consultation to the patient,  and environmental intervention strategies) as well  as DBT protocols, particularly the suicide protocol.  These strategies and protocols are described in full  in the main DBT text and are reviewed in Chapter  5 of this manual. At this time, we have no evidence  that type of academic degree is a critical factor in  improving skills training outcomes. 

Skill trainers’ attitudes toward clients are also  very important. Clients who fail to behave skillfully,  and claim not to know how to behave differently,  are viewed by some therapists as resistant (or at least  as governed by motives outside awareness). These  clinicians see giving advice, coaching, making sug 

gestions, or otherwise teaching new behaviors as  encouraging dependency and need gratification that  gets in the way of “real” therapy. Other therapists  and skills trainers fall into the trap of believing that  clients can hardly do anything. At times they even  believe that the clients are incapable of learning new,  more skillful behaviors. Acceptance, nurturance,  and environmental intervention compromise the ar 

mamentarium of these clinicians. Not surprisingly,  when these two orientations coexist within a client’s  treatment team, conflict and “staff splitting” often  arise. A dialectical approach would suggest looking  for the synthesis, as I discuss more fully in Chapter  13 of the main DBT text. 

When a DBT team is being started, the criteria for  membership on the team are the same for all partici pants. Each participant must be on the team volun tarily, must agree to attend team meetings, must be  committed to learning and applying DBT, and must  be equally vulnerable to team influence. The last  criterion means that all participants will bring to  the team any difficulties and issues related to their  attempts to apply DBT principles and interventions  (including skills interventions) with the clients they  are working with. 

Selecting Skills Modules    
and Specific Skills to Teach 

As noted in Chapter 1, there are four separate DBT  skills modules: Mindfulness, Interpersonal Effec-

tiveness, Emotion Regulation, and Distress Toler ance. Each module is divided into core sections  and supplementary sections with specialized, op tional, or advanced skills. The latter sections can be  dropped if they do not meet the needs of specific  client populations or if time demands it. Sections  and specific skills can also be taught separately. (See  Table 1.1 for which skills are core and which are  supplementary.) A set of general handouts is given  out during orientation before the start of each Mind fulness skills module, if there are new members in  the group. A set of supplementary skills teaching  behavioral analyses is also included in the general  skills. In standard DBT, skills training is conduct ed in groups of 6–8 (10 at the most) participants  plus 2 group leaders, once a week for 2.5 hours (2  hours with adolescents). Participants complete one  full cycle of core skills through all the modules in 6  months. In a 1-year treatment program, participants  then repeat the cycle for a total of 12 months. The  core skills modules are each designed to take from  5 to 7 weeks (Interpersonal Effectiveness, 5 weeks;  Distress Tolerance, 6 weeks; Emotion Regulation, 7  weeks). The Mindfulness module is designed to take  two weeks and is repeated, along with a brief ori entation, before the start of each new module. This  basic cycle is outlined in Table 2.2. See the Appendi ces to Part I for a more detailed outline, along with  session-by-session outlines of different DBT skills  training programs for various disorders, time peri ods, and settings. 

There are no empirical data to suggest how to  order the modules. Since the core mindfulness skills  are woven throughout the other training modules,  Mindfulness obviously has to be the first module  presented. In our current program, the Interperson 

al Effectiveness, Emotion Regulation, and Distress  Tolerance modules follow in that order, and that is  their order in this manual. 

The Interpersonal Effectiveness module focuses  on how clients can decrease pain and suffering by  effectively interacting with their social environ ment both to elicit changes in others and (when  warranted) to resist unwanted influence from oth ers. The Emotion Regulation module assumes that  even though a situation (interpersonal or otherwise)  may generate pain and suffering, an individual’s re sponses also have to change and can be changed.  The Distress Tolerance module assumes that even  though there may be a lot of pain and suffering, it  can be tolerated, and life can be accepted and lived  in spite of pain. Surely this is a difficult lesson for  anyone. One can, however, make a reasonably good

case for any order of modules. In many clinics, cli ents are given the crisis survival strategies handouts  (part of the Distress Tolerance module) during the  first meeting. These skills are more or less self explanatory, and many clients find them extremely  helpful. They are then reviewed in detail when the  Distress Tolerance module is taught. For some cli ents, their dysregulation and lack of understanding  of emotions are so great that a case can be made for  starting with the Emotion Regulation module. This  is often the case, for example, in our multifamily  adolescent groups. 

Suggestions for Planning a Skills  Training Curriculum 

Instructional material in skills training, especially  in a group context, should be presented at a pace  adapted to the level of participants’ understanding.  Since the pace of each session will differ, as will the  overall pace for particular individuals or groups,  the instructional content in Chapters 6–10 of this  book is not divided into segments within particu 

lar sessions. In my experience, however, the first  time trainers teach these skill modules, the amount  of material feels overwhelming. New skills train ers tend to spend too much time on early parts of a  module and then have too little time later to cover  other material that may be more important. What  actually is important will necessarily vary with dif   
28  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

ferent individuals or groups, depending on their  experience and skill levels. In order to facilitate the  coverage of all the material by the end of the time  scheduled for the particular module, the skills train 

ing leaders should construct lesson plans for each  session and should attempt to cover the designated  material during the session time allotted. Curricula  for 11 different skills programs are outlined in the  Appendices to Part I. Most of these are based on  outlines that have been used in various research  studies using DBT skills. The best strategy the first  time through a module is to follow the steps below. 

**1\.** Decide how many total weeks your skills train ing program will last, and how long each session  will be. The length of your program and of sessions  will depend on whether participants do or do not  have mental disorders, the severity of their disorders  or other problems, the goals of your treatment pro gram (e.g., stabilization, treatment, skills building),  staff availability, financial resources, research data  on outcomes of various lengths of treatment, and  factors unique to your treatment setting. 

**2\.** Decide which skills you definitely want to teach  and which skills you want to include as ancillary.  Content of skills should be based on the research  data for the disorders/problems you are addressing  and, when there are few research data to guide your  choice, on your beliefs about which skills are most  appropriate for your clients. The curricula in the  Appendices are organized by the number of weeks  each program lasts and by the population each pro gram is intended to treat. Look these over and select  the skills curriculum that fits your situation best. 

**3\.** Decide which handouts and worksheets you  want to use (see *www.guilford.com*/*skills-training manual*). Do not use them without first reviewing  them. Worksheets are associated with handouts;  the worksheets for each handout are listed after the  number of each handout, and vice versa. Descrip tions of the relevant handouts and worksheets are  given in the overview box for each skill or set of  skills in the teaching notes. 

There are several types of worksheets. Overview  worksheets cover several skills and can be used  when you want to focus primarily on practice  of a group of skills, rather than focusing inten 

sively on just the skills taught in a particular  session. These worksheets are the first ones in  each section and are linked to the handouts  that overview each section. 

Specific skills worksheets focus on a particular  skill or small skills set. In some cases, multiple  worksheets focus on the same set of skills (and  are given the same worksheet number), but  they differ in the amount of practice they pro 

vide for. The letters a, b, and c following the  worksheet number generally indicate different  demands the worksheets put on participants.  For example, some of these ask participants  to practice a particular skill once or twice be 

tween sessions; others ask that each skill in  a set be practiced between sessions; and still  others ask for daily practice of a skill or set of  skills. There are also calendar worksheets for  some skills that ask the participants to write  about the skills they use each day between ses 

sions. 

**4\.** The first time you teach skills, divide each  module arbitrarily into sections corresponding to  the exact number of weeks available, and try to get  through as much of each section as possible. This  experience will dictate how to time the modules the  second time, and so on. When I teach therapists how  to do DBT skills training, I usually recommend that  trainers copy the teaching notes covering the skills  they will teach in a specific session, and then high light the main points they plan to cover in that ses 

sion. With this strategy, it can be useful first to teach  the material in the skills modules in the order given  in this manual. After the first run-through, modi fications in content and order can be made to suit  your style or a particular situation. 

Massed versus Spaced Practice  in a 1-Year Program 

Although each training module is designed to take  5–7 weeks to cover, up to a year could be spent on  each. The content for each skills area is comprehen sive and complex for such a short period of time.  Covering the skills training material in this brief  number of weeks requires very strict time manage ment. Therapists also have to be willing to go on  when some (or even all) clients have not acquired  the skills that are currently being taught. Partici pants are sometimes overwhelmed by the amount  of information the first time they go through each  module. In a 1-year program, why not expand each  module to a series of three 10- to 14-week modules  (starting each with 2 weeks of mindfulness skills), 

rather than two sets of three 5- to 7-week modules?  In other words, why not go for massed practice (the  first choice) rather than spaced practice (the second  choice)? There are several reasons for the present  format. 

First, all individuals—but particularly those who  have trouble regulating their emotions—can be  variable in their mood and functionality. They may  go through periods of several weeks where they may  miss meetings or, when present, pay attention mini 

mally (if at all). Presenting material twice increases  the probability that each person will be present,  both physically and psychologically, at least once  when a particular segment is covered. 

Second, different participants have different  needs; thus the modules are differentially relevant  and preferred by various individuals. Having to sit  through a disliked module for 10–14 weeks is very  difficult. Sitting through 5–7 weeks of a disliked  module is also hard, but not as hard. 

Third, in a 10- to 14-week format, the modules  scheduled second and third get less practice time  than in a 5- to 7-week format taught twice. If I could  make a case that one module is indeed the most im 

portant and needs the most practice, this would not  be a liability. However, I have no controlled em pirical data to use in choosing which module that  would be. In addition, it is doubtful that one module  would be best for all clients. The central premise of  a behavioral skills-oriented approach is that acquisi tion of new skills requires extensive practice. Even  though the material often feels overwhelming the  first time when presented in the 5- to 7-week format,  clients nonetheless seem able to practice the skills in  their everyday lives. Thus presenting each module  once during the first 6 months of treatment leaves a  minimum of 6 months for continued practice before  skill training ends. 

Fourth, going over the material after clients have  had a chance to practice the skills for several months  can be beneficial. The material makes more sense.  And it offers the chance for the participants to learn  that problems that seem really hard at one point  may not always seem so hard if they persevere in  their attempts to overcome them. 

Finally, my experience has been that when 10–14  weeks are allotted to cover a treatment module, it is  far easier to divert therapy time to attending to in dividual participants’ crises and process issues. It is  easy for the leaders to start thinking that they have  plenty of time for digressive topics. Although some  attention must be given to these issues, it is easy to    
**2\. Planning to Conduct DBT Skills Training**  •  29 

drift out of skills training and toward supportive  process therapy, when time is not of the essence.  In my experience, once this has happened, it is ex tremely difficult to get back control of the therapy  agenda. 

Individual versus Group    
Skills Training 

Successful DBT skills training requires discipline  by both participants and skills trainers. In skills  training, the session agenda is set by the skills to  be learned. In typical psychotherapy and in DBT  individual therapy, by contrast, the agenda is usu 

ally set by a client’s current problems. When current  problems are pressing, staying with a skills training  agenda requires the skills trainers to take a very ac tive role, controlling the direction and focus of the  session. Many therapists and skills trainers are not  trained to take such a directive role; thus, despite  their good intentions, their efforts at skills train ing often peter out as participants’ problems esca late. Inadequate attention to the actual teaching of  skills, and the resulting drift in focus, are particu larly likely in individual as opposed to group skills  training. 

Even trainers who are well trained in directive  strategies have great difficulty keeping to a direc tive agenda when participants have pressing prob lems or crisis situations and want immediate help  or advice. The inevitable crises and high emotional  pain of such clients constitute a major and con tinuing problem. It is difficult for the participants,  and consequently for their skills trainers, to attend  to anything but the current crises during sessions.  It is particularly difficult to stay focused on skills  when a participant threatens to commit suicide or  otherwise quit if his or her current problem is not  taken seriously. Taking it seriously (from the par ticipant’s point of view) usually means forgoing the  day’s skills training agenda in favor of resolving the  current crisis. 

Other participants may be less demanding of ses sion time and energy, but their passivity, sleepiness,  fidgetiness, and/or lack of interest in skills training  may pose a formidable roadblock. It is easy in such  a case for a therapist or skills trainer to get worn out  with the client and just give up the effort, especially  if a trainer is not a firm believer in skills training  anyway. Skills training can also be relatively boring  for those doing it if participants are nonresponsive,   
30  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

especially for trainers who have done considerable  skills training with other participants. It is like a  surgeon’s doing the same operation over and over  and over. Clients’ fluctuating moods from week to  week and within the skills training sessions (a char 

acteristic of individuals who have trouble regulating  their emotions), together with therapists’ wavering  interest, can create havoc with the best-laid skills  training plans. 

Skills training is difficult with clients who have  multiple problems, serious difficulties regulating  their emotions, frequent crises, or intense desire to  change the behavior of another person. Trying to  conduct skills training with such an individual is  like trying to teach a person how to put up a tent in  the middle of a hurricane. Nonetheless, it is also the  case that if participants had more effective skills in  their repertoires, they would be able to cope much  better with crisis situations. And this is the dilem ma: How does a trainer teach the skills necessary to  cope, when a participant’s current inability to cope  is so great that he or she is not receptive to acquiring  new behavioral responses? In individual treatment,  there is often nothing beyond the two participants  to keep therapy on track. If both participant and  skills trainer want to switch to something else, they  can do it easily. 

Keeping skills training on track can also be ex tremely difficult when the participants are friends  and family members of other people who are hav ing very serious difficulties. This is particularly the  problem when participants are parents or spouses/ partners of individuals who are at high risk for  suicide or are engaging in dysfunctional behavior  patterns that the participants are having extreme  difficulties tolerating. In groups for friends and fam ily members, it is very important for the leaders to  make it clear during orientation that the focus of  skills training is always on increasing the skills of  the *participants*. The focus is *not* on how to change  other people. This can be a particular problem for  any relative who is in skills training principally to get  consultation on how to manage a family member,  with the expectation that the relative will be able to  help the other person change. A similar problem can  occur when any group member insists on help with  changing another person (a boss, an employee, etc.).  If the difficulty is persistent or is interfering with  skills training for others, we have found that one or  two individual consultation meetings can be helpful.  Clearly, some DBT skills are aimed at influencing  others. The DBT interpersonal effectiveness skills  

focus on developing influential behavior with oth ers, including effective assertiveness with others and  behavioral skills such as reinforcement, extinction,  flooding, and punishment aimed at increasing or de creasing the behaviors of others. The line between  this focus on participants’ interpersonal skills and  ability to influence others on the one hand, and a  focus on changing specific others, may be thin—but  it is important nonetheless. Staying dialectical can  

be critical here in managing these two polarities. For many of the reasons discussed above, the  standard mode of skills training in DBT is a group  intervention. In a group, other participants—or at  least therapists’ sense of obligation to other partici pants—keeps skills trainers on track, even when one  participant wants to change course. When one par ticipant in group skills training is not in the mood  for learning skills, others may be. The reinforcement  these other clients give the skills trainers for con tinuing skills training can be more powerful than  the punishment delivered by the participant who is  not in the mood. 

The crux of the problem is this: Skills training  with an individual who does not see its benefits right  away is often not immediately reinforcing for either  the participant or the person teaching the skills. For  many individuals, there is not a sense of immediate  relief or problem solving. Skills training is like teach 

ing tennis: A student does not usually win the first  game after the first lesson. Winning takes practice,  practice, practice. Nor is behavioral skills training  as interesting as having “heart-to-hearts,” a topic I  have discussed in Chapter 12 of the main DBT text.  Skills training requires much more active work for  both client and therapist. Thus, for individual skills  training to work, special precautions must be made  for arranging events so that *both* therapist and client  will find it reinforcing enough to continue. 

*Individual Skills Training* 

A number of circumstances may make it preferable  or necessary to conduct skills training with an in dividual client rather than in a group. In a private  practice setting or a small clinic, there may not be  more than one client needing skills training at any  one time, or you may not be able to organize more  than one person at a time for skills training. Some  clients are not appropriate for groups. Although in  my experience this is very rare, a client who can not inhibit overt aggressive behavior toward other  group members should not be put into a group until 

this behavior is under control. It is also usually pref erable to treat social anxiety disorder (social pho bia) before asking a client to join a skills training  group. Some clients may have already participated  in 1 year or more of a skills training group, but  need further focused attention to one category or  set of skills. 

Finally, a client may not be able to attend the  offered group sessions. In primary care settings,  or when skills training is being integrated into in dividual therapy, skills may be taught during indi vidual therapy sessions. In these situations, having  the skills handouts and worksheets readily available  will make it easiest for the individual practitioners  to slip skills training into the fabric of ongoing indi vidual care. In such a case, the therapist can make  continuous efforts to incorporate the skills training  procedures in every session. A problem with this ap proach is that the rules are not clear: It is often not  apparent to the client what contingencies are oper ating at any given time in an interaction. The client  who wants to focus on an immediate solution to an  immediate crisis, therefore, has no guidelines as to  when insisting on such attention is appropriate and  likely to be reinforced and when it is not. A problem  for the therapist is that it is extremely difficult to re main on track. My own inability to do just this was  one of the important factors in the development of  DBT as it is today. 

A second alternative is to have a second therapist  do individual skills training with each client. The  rules for client and therapist behavior in this case  are clear. In this format, general behavioral skills  are learned with the skills trainer; crises manage 

ment and individual problem solving, including the  application of skills learned to particular crisis or  problem situations, are the focus of sessions with  the primary therapist or case manager. This ap 

proach seems especially advantageous in certain  situations. For example, in our university clinic a  number of students are eager to obtain experience in  working with individuals with severe disorders who  need long-term therapy, but the students are not able  to commit to longer-term individual therapy. Con 

ducting focused skills training for a period of time  is a good opportunity for these students, and in my  experience it has also worked out well for the cli ents. This would be an option in any setting where  residents, social workers, or nurses are in training.  In a group clinical practice, therapists may conduct  skills training for each other; a large practice may  hire some therapists with specific talents in this    
**2\. Planning to Conduct DBT Skills Training**  •  31 

area. The treatment model here is somewhat similar  to a general practitioner’s sending a client to a spe cialist for specialized treatment. 

Individual therapists who have no one to refer  clients to for skills training, or who want to do it  themselves, should make the context of skills train ing different from that of usual psychotherapy. For  example, a separate weekly meeting devoted specifi cally to skills training may be scheduled, or skills  training and individual therapy can alternate week ly. The latter choice is particularly likely to work  when the client does not need weekly individual  sessions focused on crises and problem solving. If  possible, the skills session should be conducted in  a room different from that used for individual psy chotherapy. Other possibilities include switching  chairs; moving a table or desk near (or between)  the therapist and the client to put the skills train ing materials on; using a blackboard; turning up the  lighting; having skills training sessions at a different  time of day than psychotherapy sessions, or for a  shorter or longer time period; arranging for audio or  video recordings of the sessions if this is not done in  individual psychotherapy, or vice versa; and billing  differently. For a therapist with a particularly dif ficult client, participation in a supervision/consulta tion group is important in keeping up motivation  and focusing on skills. Even for those individuals  who are in group skills training, a task of individual  therapists is to reinforce the use of skills and also to  teach skills “ahead of time,” so to speak, as needed.  Many therapists in our clinic also give clients skills  homework assignments related to current problems,  using the DBT skills training worksheets. 

*Group Skills Training* 

The chief advantage of group skills training is that it  is efficient. A group can include as few as two peo ple. In our clinic, with very dysfunctional clients,  we try to have six to eight persons in each group.  Group treatment has much to offer, over and above  what any individual therapy can offer. First, thera pists have an opportunity to observe and work with  interpersonal behaviors that show up in peer rela tionships but may only rarely occur in individual  therapy sessions. Second, clients have an opportuni ty to interact with other people like themselves, and  the resulting validation and development of a sup port group can be very therapeutic. DBT encourages  outside-of-session relationships among skills group  clients, as long as those relationships—including   
32  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

any conflicts—can be discussed inside the sessions.  Third, clients have an opportunity to learn from  one another, thus increasing avenues of therapeutic  input. Fourth, groups typically reduce the intensity  of the personal relationship between individual cli 

ents and the group leaders; in dynamic terms, the  transference is diluted. This can be very important,  because the intensity of therapy sometimes creates  more problems than it solves for clients who have  problems regulating their emotions. Fifth, if a norm  of practicing skills between sessions can be estab 

lished, such a norm can increase skills practice in  individuals who on their own might be much less  likely to do the skills homework practice ordinarily  assigned weekly. Finally, skills groups offer a rela 

tively nonthreatening opportunity for individual cli ents to learn how to be in a group. 

In my ongoing DBT research programs, we have  offered a variety of different treatment programs. In  our 1-year standard DBT program, clients in indi vidual therapy also participate in group skills train ing. In our 1-year DBT case management program,  clients have a DBT case manager as well as group  skills training. In our adolescent program, each ado lescent sees an individual therapist, and the parents  or other caregivers and the adolescent attend the  skills group. We also offer a 6-month skills train ing program for friends and family members of in dividuals who either are difficult to be with or have  difficult mental disorders. We have offered a similar  skills training group for individuals with emotion  dysregulation. 

A number of issues need to be considered in set ting up a skills group—whether to have open or  closed groups; whether groups should be heteroge neous or homogeneous; and how many group lead ers or trainers there should be and what these per sons’ roles should be. I discuss these issues next. 

Open versus Closed Groups 

In an open group, new members can enter on a con tinuing basis. In a closed group, the group is formed  and stays together for a certain time period; new  members are not allowed once the group composi tion is stable. Whether a group is open or closed will  often depend on pragmatic issues. In many clinical  settings, especially inpatient units, open groups are  a necessity. In outpatient settings, however, it may  be possible to round up a number of people who  want skills training and who will agree to stay to 

gether for a period of time. If a choice is available,  which type of group works better? 

I have tried both types of groups and believe that  open groups work better for skills training. There  are two reasons. First, in a closed group it becomes  progressively easier to deviate from the skills train 

ing agenda. Process issues frequently become more  prominent as members get more comfortable with  one another. The group as a whole can begin to drift  away from a focus on learning behavioral skills. Al 

though process issues may be important and cannot  be ignored, there is a definite difference between a  behavioral skills training group and an interpersonal  process group. Periodically adding new skills train 

ing group members, who expect to learn new behav ioral skills, forces the group to get back on task. Second, in an open group new clients have the  capacity to reenergize a group or allow a change  of norms when needed. In addition, for individuals  with difficulty with change and/or trust, an open  group allows clients an opportunity to learn to cope  with change in a relatively stable environment. A  somewhat controlled but continual rate of change  allows therapeutic exposure to change in a context  where clients can be helped to respond to it effec tively. 

Heterogeneous versus    
Homogeneous Groups 

DBT skills training group members in my clinic are  largely (but not completely) homogeneous with re spect to diagnosis. Depending on the training needs  of my students or the research studies currently in  progress, we have restricted entry to individuals  who (1) meet criteria for BPD; (2) have BPD and  are highly suicidal; (3) have BPD with serious anger  problems; (4) have BPD and substance use disorders;  (5) have BPD and PTSD; (6) are suicidal adolescents  together with their parents; (7) have disordered emo 

tion regulation; or (8) are friends or family mem bers of individuals with serious disorders. In most  groups, we will also allow in one or two partici pants who are being treated in our clinic but meet  criteria for other disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety  disorders). Group members are not particularly ho mogeneous in other ways. Ages range from 13 to 18  years in the adolescent groups and from 18 up in  other groups; some groups include clients of both  sexes. Socioeconomic, education, marital, and pa rental statuses vary.

With the exception of groups designed for friends  and families and for adolescents and their families,  we prohibit sexual partners from being in the same  skills training group. Sexual partners are placed into  different groups at intake. If a sexual relationship  develops among two members of a group, we have a  rule that one must drop out. Such relationships can  create enormous difficulties for the partners. 

For many of our clients so far, our group repre sents their first experience of being with other in dividuals sharing very similar difficulties. Although  from my perspective a homogeneous group is an  asset in doing group skills training, the choice obvi ously has pros and cons. 

*Arguments against*    
*a Homogeneous Group* 

There are a number of rather strong arguments  against a homogeneous group of clients who have  severe disorders, including severe emotion dysregu lation, suicidal behaviors, or behaviors that might  elicit contagion. First, such a group for suicidal and/ or highly impulsive individuals can be risky on an  outpatient basis. Any kind of therapy, individual or  group, can be very stressful for clients with disor dered emotion regulation. Extreme emotional re activity all but ensures that intense emotions will  be aroused, requiring skillful therapeutic manage ment. A therapist has to be very good at reading and  responding to nonverbal cues and indirect verbal  communications—a difficult task under the best of  circumstances. Therapeutic comments can be misin terpreted, or interpreted in a way that the therapist  did not mean, and insensitive comments can have a  strong impact. 

These problems are compounded in group therapy.  It is impossible for therapists to track and respond  individually to each group member’s emotional re sponses to a therapy session. With more clients and  a faster pace than in individual therapy, there are  more opportunities for therapists to make mistakes  and insensitive remarks, as well as for clients to mis construe what is going on. In addition, it is more dif ficult for clients to express their emotional reactions  to a group therapist in front of other group mem bers. Thus the possibility for clients leaving in tur moil, with emotional responses they cannot handle,  is greatly increased in group over individual therapy. 

A second, related drawback to homogeneous  groups has to do with the tendency of clients with  high emotion regulation problems to become emo   
**2\. Planning to Conduct DBT Skills Training**  •  33 

tionally involved with one another’s problems and  tragedies. These clients often become anxious,  angry, depressed, and hopeless not only about the  problems in their own lives, but about the problems  of those close to them. Thus just listening to oth 

ers’ life descriptions can precipitate intense, painful  emotional responses. This has also been a very dif ficult issue for our staff members; we also have to  listen to painful story after story from our clients.  Imagine how much more difficult it is for individu als who have little capacity to modulate their re 

sponses to emotionally charged information. Another argument against homogeneous groups  of clients who have trouble regulating their emo tions or impulses is based on the notion that in such  a group there will be no one to model appropriate,  adaptive behaviors—or, similarly, that there will  be extensive modeling of inappropriate behaviors.  I have simply not found this to be the case. In fact,  I am frequently amazed at the capacity of our cli ents to be helpful to one another in coping with  life’s problems. In difficult therapy protocols such  as exposure-based procedures, it is not unusual for  clients to help each other cope with getting through  the treatment. The one area where an absence of ap propriate modeling does seem to exist is in the area  of coping with extreme negative feelings. Especially  with suicidal individuals at the beginning of treat ment, it is often necessary for the group leaders to  take much of the responsibility for modeling how to  cope with negative emotions in a nonsuicidal man ner (see Chapter 5 of this manual). 

A fourth argument against homogeneous  groups—particularly with individuals who have  BPD or major depression—has to do with their  passivity, their ability to “catch” other’s moods  and behavior, and their inability to act in a mood 

independent fashion. Contagion of suicidal behavior  can be a particularly difficult problem. At times, if  one group member comes to a session in a discour aged or depressed mood, all members of the group  will soon be feeling the same way. If group leaders  are not careful, even they can sink down with the  members. One of the reasons why we have two lead ers for each group in our clinic is that when this  happens, each therapist will have someone to keep  him or her functioning at an energetic level. It can  be very difficult. 

Finally, it is sometimes said that some client pop ulations (e.g., adolescents or those with BPD) are  more prone to “attention seeking” than are other  clients, and that this tendency will be disruptive to   
34  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

any group process. Once again, I have not found  this to be the case. 

*Arguments for a Homogeneous Group* 

From my perspective, there are two powerful argu ments for a homogeneous group. First, homogeneity  allows the group leaders to tailor the skills and theo retical conceptions they offer to the specific prob lems of group members. Most of the skills taught  are applicable for many client populations. Howev er, a heterogeneous group requires a much more ge neric presentation of the skills, and the application  of the skills to each person’s central problems has  to be worked out individually. With a homogeneous  group, examples can be given that reflect their spe cific problems and situations. A common conceptual  scheme would be difficult to present in a heteroge neous group unless it was very general. 

A second argument for a homogeneous group is  the opportunity for clients to be with a group of indi viduals who share the same problems and concerns.  In my experience, this is a very powerful validating  experience for our clients. Many have been in other  groups but have not had the experience of being  around others like themselves. For those with BPD  and other severe disorders, they may have finally  found others who actually understand the often in explicable urges to injure themselves, the desire to  be dead, the inability to regulate anger, the power  of urges to use drugs, the inability to pop out of a  depressed mood, the frustration of being unable to  control emotions and behavior, or the pain of emo tionally invalidating experiences. Adolescents have  found others who understand their difficulties with  parents, the pain of being bullied, their intense desire  to be acceptable, and their beliefs that they are not.  In a group for friends and family members, clients  share the pain of having loved ones suffering and the  frequent sense of desperation and helplessness. 

A factor that can complicate the advantage of  having an entire group of individuals with the same  disorder or problem has to do with different rates  of individual progress in treatment. When one cli 

ent is engaging in dysfunctional behaviors, it is very  validating to have other group members struggling  with the same issue. However, once the client has  stopped such behaviors, it can be very hard if oth 

ers are still engaging in the same behaviors. Hear ing about others’ out-of-control behavior seems to  cause a greater urge to do the same thing; this is, of  

course, a threatening experience for a person who is  working hard at avoiding dysfunctional patterns of  behavior. In addition, we have found that as clients  progress in therapy, they often begin to change their  self-image from that of “person with a disorder” to  that of “normal person.” Especially if they are very  judgmental, they can find it very hard to stay in a  group defined as a group for disordered individuals.  These two issues—the urge to imitate dysfunctional  behavior, and the need to change one’s self-image  from “disordered” to “not disordered”—must be  dealt with effectively by the group leaders if an indi vidual is to continue with the group. 

Clarifying Providers’ Roles 

*Skills Group Leaders* 

In standard DBT groups, we use a model of a pri mary group leader and a co-leader. The functions  of the two leaders during a typical session differ.  The primary leader begins the meetings, conducts  the initial behavioral analyses of homework prac tice, and presents new material about skills. The pri mary group leader is also responsible for the timing  of the session, moving from person to person as time  allows. Thus the primary group leader has overall  responsibility for skills acquisition. 

The co-leader’s functions are more diverse. First,  he or she mediates tensions that arise between mem bers and the primary leader, providing a balance  from which a synthesis can be created. Second, while  the primary group leader is looking at the group as a  whole, the co-leader keeps a focus on each individ ual member, noting any need for individual atten tion and either addressing that need directly during  group sessions or consulting with the primary leader  during breaks. Third, the co-leader serves as a co teacher and tutor, offering alternative explanations,  examples, and so on. The co-leader may move his  or her seating around the group as needed to assist  participants in finding the right handouts or work sheets or to provide needed support. The co-leader is  often the person who keeps track of the homework  assignments. This is especially important when spe cial individual assignments are given to one or more  participants in the group. In these cases, it is also  the co-leader who is charged with remembering the  various assignments. 

Generally, if there is a “bad guy,” it is the primary  group leader, who enforces the group norms; if there 

is a “good guy,” it is the co-leader, who always tries  to see life from the point of view of a person who is  “down.” More often than not in a group meeting,  though not always, the person who is “down” is a  group member; thus, the “good guy” image emerges  for the co-leader. As long as both leaders keep the  dialectical perspective of the whole, this division of  labor and roles can be quite therapeutic. Obviously,  it requires a degree of personal security on the part  of both therapists if it is to work. 

The DBT consultation strategies can be especially  important here. The DBT consultation team serves  as the third point providing the dialectical balance  between the two co-leaders, much as the co-leader  does between the primary leader and a group mem 

ber in a group session. Thus the function of the DBT  consultation team is to highlight the truth in each  side of an expressed tension, fostering reconciliation  and synthesis. 

Over the years, many DBT teams have tried to  convince me that one skills leader is all that is needed  for most groups. I remain unconvinced. With highly  dysregulated and/or suicidal individuals, a co-leader  is invaluable as a person who can leave the room if  needed to block a suicidal person from carrying out  a suicide threat, go and get an ice pack for a person  with extreme arousal, validate a person who feels  attacked by the leader, or coach one person during a  break while the leader coaches another. In a multi family group, the co-leader can coach the adolescent  while the leader nudges a parent to practice his or  her skills with the adolescent. In groups for friends  and family members, as well as other groups where  participants have no identified mental disorders, it is  surprising how helpful a co-leader can be in attend 

ing to the process issues that often arise. In sum,  managing a group in skills training is a complex  task. Finally, there is no substitute for having an ob server of one’s own behavior and skills as a group  leader or co-leader. For example, due to my work  schedule and one skills training group’s meeting in  the evening, I was coming into group sessions as the  primary leader with very little energy, looking tired  and sounding uninteresting. Naturally, this did not  bode well for a successful skills training session. My  co-leader brought it up with me, and we decided on  a plan to “rev me up” each week (drinking a cold  cola right before group). Now my co-leader not only  reminds me each week, but also gives me feedback  at break if I need to make a greater effort at “com 

ing alive.”

*Individual Skills Trainers* 

In individual skills training, the skills trainer plays  the role of both the skills leader and the co-leader as  described above. It is extremely important in indi vidual work that the skills trainer stick to the role of  teaching skills, while balancing teaching with neces sary troubleshooting of problems in learning skills  and skills use that arise. Although an individual  skills trainer is not an individual therapist, it is ap propriate for such a trainer to suggest specific skills  for problems that clients present, such as opposite  action when a client is avoiding something or cope  ahead when a client is afraid of failing at something.  That said, it is important for an individual skills  trainer not to fall into the role of being an individual  therapist. The best way to avoid this is always to  keep in mind the mantra of “What skills can you  use?” 

*DBT Individual Therapists* 

An individual therapist for a person in skills train ing is the primary treatment provider and as such  is responsible for overall treatment planning; for  management of crises, including suicidal crises; for  taking as-needed coaching and crisis calls or arrang ing for another provider to take these calls; and for  making decisions on modifications to treatment, in cluding how many complete rounds of skills train ing the individual should be in, whether admission  to a higher level of care is necessary, and so forth.  Except in a crisis to avoid serious injury or death,  skills trainers turn crisis management over to indi vidual therapists. 

The task of the therapist with an individual in  skills training also includes applying the lens of be havioral skills to helping clients generate solutions  to their problems. Indeed, when confronted with a  client’s problem, a well-trained clinical provider can  find an approach to problem solving by using skills  from each skills module. Thus, when Distress Toler ance is the current treatment module (or a distress  tolerance skill is what the therapist wishes the client  to practice), problems may be viewed as ones where  distress tolerance is needed. If interpersonal effec tiveness is the focus, then the individual provider  may ask how the problem (or the solution) might be  related to interpersonal actions. Generally, problems  become “problems” because the events are associ ated with aversive emotional responses; one solution   
36  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

may be for the client to work on changing emotional  responses to a situation. An effective response may  also be cast in terms of radical acceptance or core  mindfulness skills. 

*DBT Case Managers* 

If a client has no individual psychotherapist, a DBT  case manager is the primary provider and is responsi ble for all the tasks outlined above for the individual  therapist. In addition, although both psychothera pists and case managers focus on clinical assessment,  planning, and problem solving, case managers are  ordinarily more active in facilitating care in the cli ent’s living environment. Thus the case manager’s  role also includes identification of service resources,  active communication with service providers, care  coordination, and advocacy for options and services  to meet an individual’s and family’s needs. In this  role, the case manager not only helps identify appro priate providers and facilities throughout the con tinuum of services, but also actively works with the  client to ensure that available resources are being  used in a timely and cost-effective manner. In sum,  in contrast to a DBT therapist, a case manager does  much more environmental intervention. As a DBT  case manager, however, the task is to move more  to the center and increase use of “consultation-to the-patient” strategies (see below). The idea here is  to coach clients to actively engage in the tasks that  the case managers ordinarily do for the clients—in  other words, to teach the clients to fish rather than  catch the fish for them. This then involves coaching  the clients in the interpersonal, emotion regulation,  distress tolerance, and mindfulness skills necessary  to be successful.3 

*DBT Nurses and Line Staff* 

The primary role of DBT nurses and line staff is to  manage contingencies on inpatient and residential  units, to coach clients in the use of skills, and to use  DBT skills to problem-solve difficulties. Their role in  skill strengthening and generalization is often criti 

cal in milieu-based treatment programs. These pro viders often make extensive use of the chain analysis  skill (described in Chapter 6), as assisting patients  with understanding the factors that prompt and  drive their behaviors is typically accomplished with  more accuracy in the situation where the behaviors  occur. From this analysis, a nurse or line staff mem 

ber can more effectively provide suggestions for a  more skillful response or can more clearly intervene  in the contingencies surrounding the behavior. 

*DBT Pharmacotherapists* 

The primary duties of a pharmacotherapist (whether  a psychiatrist or a nurse practitioner) are to provide  evidence-based medications matched to the needs  of each client, and to monitor compliance with the  prescribed medication regimen as well as outcomes  and side effects. For a DBT pharmacotherapist, a  further essential task is to coach the client whenever  possible in relevant DBT skills. DBT skills aimed at  treating physical illness, insomnia/nightmares, poor  nutrition, effects of drugs and alcohol, and lack of  exercise may seem to fit the role best, but it is equally  important to focus on the wide array of other DBT  skills as well. Like other providers, the pharmaco therapist (except in emergencies) also turns crisis  intervention over to the primary provider (therapist  or case manager), but until then often asks, “What  skills can you use until you get hold of him \[or her\]?”  In some settings, when there is no individual thera pist or case manager, the DBT pharmacotherapist  assumes the role of primary provider responsible for  the tasks outlined above. In other settings, particu 

larly when contact with the pharmacotherapist is  infrequent and clients are not known to have seri ous disorders, the skills leader assumes the role of  primary therapist. It is important that these roles be  discussed and clarified within the DBT team. 

*Skills Trainers’ Responsibilities*    
*with Primary Care Providers* 

The ability to apply any one of the behavioral skills  to any problematic situation is at once important  and very difficult. Individual providers must them selves know the behavioral skills inside and out, and  must be able to think quickly in a session or a crisis.  Given this role of the individual therapist, it is the  responsibility of the skills trainers to be sure that the  individual therapist has access to skills the client is  being taught. When an individual provider is not fa miliar with the skills being taught, the solution is to  do what is possible to inform the therapist. General ly this information, along with attendance and any  other important clinical information, is provided to  all DBT therapists at the weekly DBT team meet ings. Strategies for this are discussed below.

*Consultation between DBT Individual  Providers and Skills Trainers* 

Communication between individual DBT provid ers and skills trainers is exceptionally important. If  the expectations of each group of providers for the  other are not spelled out and frequently reviewed,  it is very likely that the two treatments will not en hance each other. Among the most important as pects of DBT are the DBT consultation team strate gies (described in Chapter 13 of the main DBT text).  These strategies require all DBT therapists to meet  on a regular basis. The goals of these meetings are to  share information and to keep therapists within the  framework of DBT. 

In my clinic, a consultation meeting is held each  week for 1–1.5 hours. During the meeting, skills  trainers review for the team which skills are the cur rent focus of group sessions. When necessary, the  skills trainers actually teach the other team mem bers the skills. In this context, it is helpful for clients  if their primary providers and skills trainers share a  common language in discussing application of be havioral skills. This also decreases the potential for  confusion. Although consistency and conformity  between various treating agents are not particularly  valued in DBT, such consistency here can be useful,  since the number of new skills to be learned is quite  large. The weekly meetings increase this commu nality. In addition, any problems individual clients  may be having in applying skills and/or interacting  in skills training group meetings are mentioned. A  client’s primary provider consults with the skills  trainers and takes such information into account in  planning the individual treatment. 

My emphasis on the importance of meetings be tween individual therapists and skills trainers may  seem to contradict “consultation-to-the-patient”  strategies, which are also integral to DBT. First, I  must point out that these consultation strategies do  require DBT therapists to walk a very fine line. The  issues are somewhat complex. When the therapeutic  unit is defined as a group of people, such as a DBT  team, a clinic, an inpatient unit, or some such en tity where multiple therapists interact with and treat  particular clients in a single coordinated treatment  program, then consultation between therapists is es sential, provided that the clients are informed of and  consent to such collaboration. Applying the consul tation strategies in these cases simply requires that  therapists refrain from intervening with each other    
**2\. Planning to Conduct DBT Skills Training**  •  37 

on *behalf* of a client. Thus therapists must be careful  not to fall into the trap of serving as intermediaries  for a client. (See Chapter 13 of the main DBT text  for a discussion of consultation-to-the-patient strat 

egies; they are also discussed briefly in Chapter 5 of  this manual.) 

*When the Primary Provider*    
*Is a Skills Trainer* 

It is not uncommon that skills trainers are also in dividual therapists or case managers for some of  the clients in a skills training group. Less often, a  pharmacotherapist may also be a skills trainer for  his or her clients. When either of these is the case,  it is important to keep roles clear. In other words,  when one is teaching skills it is important to focus  on skills, and to wait until after the skills session  ends to revert to one’s other role. This is not only  because of time constraints in a skills class, but also  because as soon as skills trainers start managing  crises, individual clients (particularly those whose  lives involve constant crises) are likely to bring up  more crises to discuss and problem-solve. Focusing  on learning new behaviors can take a lot more effort  than sitting back and discussing the crises of life. 

DBT Skills Training    
outside Standard DBT 

Standard DBT combines skills training with indi vidual therapy or intensive case management, plus  phone coaching by the individual provider and  weekly treatment team meetings. When DBT skills  training is offered without the individual provider  component, some modifications in the conduct  of skills training may be necessary. For example,  without an individual therapist, skills trainers may  decide to provide phone, text, or e-mail coaching  between sessions. There may also be a greater em 

phasis on use of DBT smartphone coaching apps and  other DBT apps and websites. (To locate these, type  “DBT self-help” in your search engine.) At times,  skills trainers may offer individual consultation ses 

sions to group members. This may be particularly  necessary in groups for friends and family members,  at times when group members are extremely dis traught about a friend or relative and want and need  more coaching in use of skills than can occur in a  single group session.  
38  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

*Clarifying Individual Therapists’ versus  Skills Trainers’ Roles in Suicidal Crises* 

Standard DBT—including individual therapy, skills  training, as-needed phone coaching/crisis interven tion, and the DBT consultation team—was designed  specifically for highly suicidal individuals with high  emotion dysregulation. Reduction of suicidal and  other maladaptive behaviors is *not* the immediate  goal of DBT skills training. Instead, skills training  is focused on teaching *general* skills that the clients  can apply to current problems in living. Application  of these skills to current suicidal behavior, to be 

haviors interfering with therapy progress (except on  occasion behaviors interfering with skills training),  and to other severely dysfunctional behaviors is not  necessarily attempted by skills trainers. 

In fact, as I discuss later, discussion of current  self-injurious behavior, substance use, and other  contagious behaviors is actively discouraged in skills  training. Reports of suicidal ideation, prior self 

injury, and other maladaptive behaviors/behaviors  interfering with therapy—including extreme prob lems with skills training—are ordinarily relegated  to individual therapists, primarily because of time  

constraints in conducting skills training. Problems maintaining this skills training orien tation arise when an individual therapist sends his  or her clients to DBT skills training because of the  strong data on DBT as an effective intervention for  highly suicidal individuals. Our non-DBT therapist  colleagues know that therapists trained in DBT are  also trained in assessment and management of sui cidal behavior. Thus a non-DBT therapist may start  mistakenly relying on a DBT skills trainer to man age high-risk suicidal behavior, at least when the  skills trainer is present or available by phone. Un fortunately, a skills training therapist in DBT is rely ing on an individual therapist in a similar manner.  In some cases a DBT skills trainer, if not trained in  DBT as a whole treatment, may not even be trained  in management of suicidal behaviors. And therein  lies the problem: Skills trainers teach skills. 

*Managing Working with Clients  of Non-DBT Individual Therapists* 

When a DBT skills client is in therapy (or case man agement) with a non-DBT therapist, it is particular ly important for the skills trainer(s) to have a very  clear agreement with the individual therapist. In my  clinic, we only agree to accept a client with high sui 

cidality and/or severe disorders if the client’s indi vidual therapist agrees to the following: 

**1\.** The provider or a designated backup individ ual therapist must agree to resist the temptation to  rely on the skills trainer to conduct interventions  aimed at reducing current suicidal and other se verely dysfunctional behaviors. This means that the  individual therapist must agree to be available for  crisis calls from the skills trainer and/or the client  during and following skills training sessions. This  agreement is intended to ensure that the individu al therapist, rather than the skills trainer, makes  treatment decisions about the client when problems  or crises arise. In essence, a skills trainer calls the  individual therapist if a crisis arises, and then fol lows treatment directions. This policy is based on  the presumption that the individual therapist knows  the client much better than the skills trainer, and  that this knowledge is essential in making decisions  about crisis management. The individual therapist  must be made aware of this policy, and must also be  willing to be responsible for treatment management  and decision making about treatment. Although a  skills trainer may make sure that a client actually  gets to the local hospital emergency department,  this is very different from deciding that such a move  should be made in the first place. An exception to  this policy is made when a client is highly suicidal,  and the skills trainer believes medical treatment  or emergency evaluation for inpatient treatment is  needed, but the individual therapist either disagrees  without an adequate rationale or refuses to make  the necessary treatment management decision. In dividual therapists should be advised also that skills  therapists are not available for crisis calls from their  clients. 

**2\.** The individual therapist must agree to coach  the client on use of DBT skills in everyday life. We  ordinarily give second copies of all the DBT skills  handouts and worksheets to our clients and ask them  to give these copies to their individual therapists. To  be successful, an individual psychotherapist needs  to elicit from a client sufficient information about  the skills taught in skills training to be able to help  the client apply the skills in troublesome areas. The  therapist also needs to know (or learn) the skills and  be able to apply the skills him- or herself; this is not  as simple as it might seem. It is important also to  advise therapists that skills trainers do not do tele phone coaching on skills, as that is viewed as the  role for the individual therapist.

**3\.** Therapists must understand and agree that  skills trainers will not give them reports about  their client’s behaviors in group sessions or reports  on group attendance. If a therapist wants such re 

ports and a client agrees, a skills trainer may agree  to give periodic reports to the client, who can then  give such reports to the therapist. The principle here  is contained within the consultation-to-the-patient  strategy, which promotes the patient as a credible  source of information who can intervene effectively  on his or her own behalf within the health care net 

work. (See Chapter 13 of the main DBT text.) 

In our clinic, we use the agreement in Figure 2.1  and ask each non-DBT individual therapist to sign  it. The experience in my clinic has been that most  individual therapists in private practice will agree to  these stipulations to get their clients into our skills  groups. However, we have had some therapists who  initially agreed to these points but, when serious  crises arose, insisted that we make the clinical deci 

sions about their clients. We have also had clients  who were seeing therapists who refused to take af ter-hours calls themselves, and instead used our area  crisis line as their “backup therapist.” Unfortunate ly, many crisis clinics are staffed by volunteers with  little or no formal clinical training, and so a skills  trainer cannot usually turn client responsibility over  to a crisis line volunteer. It is critical, therefore, that  skills trainers who do not want to take responsibil ity for managing crises (particularly suicidal crises)  discuss crisis management with clients’ individual  therapists before beginning skills training, and also  

Client Name:                        
**2\. Planning to Conduct DBT Skills Training**  •  39 

clarify who will be on call for the clients during and  after skills training sessions. Thus we also ask each  client’s primary therapist to fill out a crisis plan. A  form for obtaining a crisis plan and other essential  information from a primary therapist is shown in  Figure 2.2. 

*When Individual Psychotherapists  Do Not Incorporate Skills Coaching  into Psychotherapy* 

Active intervention and skills coaching may not be  compatible with the individual psychotherapy a par ticular therapist is willing to engage in. Some thera pists, for example, view helping clients learn new  skillful behaviors as treating the “symptoms” in stead of the “illness.” In one setting, individual psy chotherapists (who were physicians) told clients to  get coaching from the nurses in how to replace mal adaptive behaviors with skills. This sent the mes sage that the new skills were not important, since  the “real therapy” was taking place with their indi vidual therapists. Clients with such therapists will  need extra help in using the skills they are learning. 

Skills trainers can make a number of optional  modifications to address these issues. They might  set up an extra weekly skills training meeting where  clients can get help in figuring out how to use their  skills in troublesome life situations. But people  often need help at the moment they are in crisis.  Skills training is like teaching basketball: Coaches  not only conduct practice sessions during the week,  but also attend the weekly game to help the players

She states that if she has this urge, she has successfully  coped with these by using these distraction strategies: calling her mother, playing with her dogs, going for  a walk to the park, crocheting, having a bath, doing vigorous physical exercise, listening to loud music, or  praying. As a last resort, she will call me or my backup therapist and discuss ways for her to get through the  moment. When she calls, she says that she finds it really helpful when I help her to find a means of distraction,  remind her that she has tolerated urges like this before, and help her try to solve the problem that may be  leading to her feeling this way. This plan was developed with my client.)* 

4\. If your client is assessed as in imminent risk of suicidal behavior, self-injury, or violence, and neither you nor  your backup can be immediately contacted, how should the skills trainers or other professional staff manage  your client?

use what they were practicing all week. With outpa tients, this is usually best done via telephone calls.  In standard DBT, where clients have individual DBT  psychotherapists, phone calls to skills training ther apists are severely limited; almost all calls for help  are directed to the clients’ individual therapists. If  an individual therapist does not take calls or give  coaching, however, a skills trainer may decide to ac cept them, at least when the reason for calling is to  get such coaching. 

On an inpatient unit, milieu staff members should  learn the behavioral skills along with the clients. The  staff members can then serve as coaches for the cli ents. One inpatient unit offers weekly skills consul tation meetings. The meetings are run like academic  office hours; clients can come at any time during of fice hours for coaching. Ideally, clients can also call  on one another for help. In another inpatient set ting, one therapist teaches new skills; nursing staff  members conduct regular homework review groups,  where clients meet together to go over their attempts  to practice new skills and get help with areas of diffi culty; and individual therapists reinforce the clients’  use of skills. In residential settings, it can be useful  to offer advanced skills groups where group mem bers help each other apply skills in daily situations. 

Skills generalization can also be greatly enhanced  if individuals in a client’s environment—such as  family members—also learn the skills and then help  with coaching the client every day.4 A skills trainer  or individual therapist can then assist a family mem 

ber in coaching the client. Adolescent skills training  ordinarily includes both an adolescent and at least  one parent, so each can coach the other. Parole of ficers can be taught the skills so they can coach the  parolees on their caseloads. Primary care providers  can be taught skills so they can coach their patients.  A skills curriculum has been developed for use in  school settings, where teachers and school counsel ors can coach students.4, 5 

*Integrating Skills Training into Non-DBT  Individual Therapy* 

Many non-DBT psychotherapists, counselors, case  managers, pharmacotherapists, other mental health  providers, nurses, doctors, and other profession als in general medical practice will find it useful at  times to integrate DBT skills into their treatment of  clients. Providers may want to use only one skill or a  variety of skills across different modules. Strategies  for incorporating skills into ongoing therapy are as  

follows. First, carefully read the treatment notes for  each of the skills to be used. What is important here  is that providers know the skills and know what  skills go with what problem or set of problems.  Second, decide whether to use a handout and/or  worksheet in teaching the skill, or to teach it orally  without these materials. If you are planning on oc 

casionally using handouts and/or worksheets, copy  them and keep them handy in your office or nearby.  When the occasion arises to teach a particular skill,  discuss the idea of learning a new skill with the cli 

ent. Use the orienting strategies discussed in Chap ter 6 of this manual, if necessary, to sell the skill  you want to teach. Giving a copy of the handout  to the client and keeping one yourself, review the  skill using the skills training procedures described  in Chapter 6\. Practice the skill with the client if pos sible, and give an assignment or suggestion that the  client practice the skill before the next visit. As far as  possible, be open to the client’s calling you between  sessions for skills coaching. Be sure to ask about the  client’s practice in the next visit. Periodically check  in with the client to see whether he or she is still  using the skills you have taught. Encourage contin ued skillful behavior. Although it may seem that  the directive quality of DBT skills training would  be incompatible with psychoanalytic and supportive  treatments, the fact that so many nonbehavioral and  analytic therapists teach and/or integrate DBT skills  into their therapies suggests that this is not the case  (enter “psychoanalytic DBT skills” in your search  engine for examples).

Structuring Skills Training Sessions 

In this chapter, I discuss how to structure various  types of DBT skills training sessions, including the  pretreatment sessions that should be accomplished  before an individual starts skills training. These ini 

tial sessions cover preliminary orientation and com mitment to DBT training. Once these sessions are  completed, several specific types of skills training  sessions follow, including (1) sessions that build al liance and orient new participants to skills training;  (2) ongoing skills training sessions; and (3) last ses sions when one or more individuals are ending their  DBT skills training program. 

Pretreatment Sessions:    
Tasks to Complete before    
Skills Training Begins 

“Pretreatment” in DBT refers to all sessions and  conversations occurring between a client and a pro vider until both parties have agreed that DBT is an  appropriate intervention for the client’s goals and  wishes, and both parties have agreed to work to gether. 

There are five pretreatment tasks (outlined in  Table 3.1): (1) conducting a pretreatment assessment  and deciding the appropriateness of skills training  for the client; (2) deciding on the intensity of treat 

ment and type of skills training needed for this par ticular client; (3) orienting the client to the specif ics of skills training; (4) developing a collaborative  commitment to do skills training together; and (5)  beginning to develop an alliance. Each of these steps  should be gone through during the initial individual  interviews with each client before he or she is ad mitted to skills training, and Steps 3–5 should be    
repeated during skills orientation, which precedes  each iteration of the Mindfulness module. 

*Conducting a Pretreatment Assessment* 

Evaluation for skills training should begin with a  clinical assessment, including assessment of pre senting problems and goals, past and present life threatening behaviors, diagnostic evaluation as  needed, and evaluation of reading and language  deficits (if the client’s skills in these areas seem  questionable). The assessor should also take a gen eral history and ask about history of previous DBT  and DBT skills training. These assessments can be  done either informally, or formally with structured  behavioral assessments. Depending on your setting,  it might be advisable to conduct a phone screening  interview before scheduling an in-person interview.  We have found this particularly important for our  friends-and-family groups and for groups aimed  at treating individuals with specific problems (e.g.,  substance use disorders) or diagnoses. The assessor  should also decide whether skills training, either  individually or in a group, appears appropriate for  this client.

*Determining the Intensity*    
*of Treatment and Type of Skills*    
*Training Needed* 

A major function of the assessment sequence de scribed above is to determine whether the individual  client needs a more comprehensive treatment than  stand-alone DBT skills training. In other words,  does the person need something more than DBT  skills? Many options and intensities of care can be  considered, such as standard outpatient DBT; DBT  skills training plus intensive case management; DBT  skills integrated into individual DBT; DBT added  to non-DBT case management or psychotherapy;  and inpatient, residential, and day treatment DBT.  (See Dimeff and Koerner’s book for descriptions of  various models of DBT intervention.1) The num 

ber and type of additional treatment components  will depend for the most part on the client’s “level  of disorder,” which is defined by the current pres ence of mental disorder and (if present) the sever ity, pervasiveness, and complexity of the disorder,  as well as the disability and imminent threat to  life it creates for the client. The level of disorder is  linked to one of four stages of treatment in DBT.  Stages of treatment are, in turn, linked to goals  and specific targets of behavior to increase and de crease. Table 3.2 is a guide to making this series of  decisions. 

Generally, the criteria for putting a client in Stage  1 are a current severe mental disorder, behavioral  dyscontrol, and/or imminent threat to life. Any of  these conditions will prohibit working on any other  goals before behavior and functioning come under  better control. As Mintz suggested in discussing  treatment of the suicidal client, all forms of psycho 

therapy are ineffective with a dead client.2 In the  subsequent stages (2–4), the treatment goals are to  replace “quiet desperation” with nontraumatic emo tional experiencing (Stage 2); to achieve “ordinary”  happiness and unhappiness, and to reduce ongoing  disorders and problems in living (Stage 3); and to  resolve a sense of incompleteness, and to achieve a  sense of freedom and joy (Stage 4). Not all clients  enter therapy at the same stage of disorder; not all  clients go through all of the stages; and clients can  vacillate between stages. 

As noted in Chapter 1, DBT skills training is now  being offered as a stand-alone treatment for several  mental disorders and for an array of other specific  problems; as a preventive intervention in school sys 

tems; and as a set of interpersonal, mindfulness, and  resiliency skills for the general public. Thus assess ment is critical to selecting the right kind of skills  program for the client. At this writing, however,  there is very little research on how to match individ uals seeking DBT to level of care needed. Thus the  recommendations in Table 3.2 are based on my own  clinical experience and that of others rather than on  firm data. 

Once the level of care is determined, the next  thing that has to be decided is what skills training  curriculum best fits the client. As far as possible,  this decision should be based on the research that  has been conducted to date and the problems pre 

sented by the clients. Unfortunately, many research  reports do not list the specific skills used. In our  clinics we always teach the DBT core skills, and  other components, such as the addiction skills, are  based on the specific problems of the clients we are  treating. I have tried to offer some assistance with  these choices in the Part I Appendices, following  Chapter 5\. 

Finally, it is important to decide how you will  evaluate progress in treatment. Many people use  the DBT diary card (see Chapter 4 of this manual)  as a method of tracking increases and decreases in  problem behaviors, as well as changes in mood, self 

efficacy, use of skills, and the client’s beliefs that  skills are helping. However, because the diary card  was developed as a means for a client and therapist  to track behavior on a weekly basis to inform week 

ly therapy, the diary is not set up in a way that is  optimal for data analysis. Using the diary card as  a way to track progress over time ordinarily means  transferring the data to some sort of database or re 

cording system and then analyzing them for changes  over time in each variable you are interested in. This  can be done by using statistics and/or by drawing  graphs that depict change over time. 

In our clinics, and in many clinics providing be havioral interventions, we also use assessment mea sures that are free or inexpensive and that have  acceptable psychometric properties. A list of the  measures we use is provided in Table 3.3. If you  use assessments from this list, it will be important  to select those that will measure outcomes that are  important to your client population. In a 6-month  treatment, it can be useful to give questionnaires at  pretreatment, at 3 months, and at 6 months. For a  1-year treatment, you might want to give them at  pretreatment and at 4, 8, and 12 months.

*Orienting the Client to the Specifics  of Skills Training* 

Following assessment, the therapist should briefly  present the skills deficit model of emotional and be havioral dysregulation, which is discussed briefly in  Chapter 1 of this manual and in detail in Chapter  2 of the main DBT text. If diagnostic interview ing and commitment to skills training have been    
thoroughly covered at intake or by the individual  therapist in standard DBT, the pretreatment meet ing with the skills leader or co-leader can be much  briefer. In my clinic, each individual in our standard  DBT program first has a thorough intake (including  diagnostic interviews), and then meets with the in dividual DBT therapist for a thorough discussion of  DBT skills training. Clients then meet with the skills  leader or co-leader for 15 or so minutes before their    
48  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

first skills session. Individuals in our skills training  groups (with no individual therapy) have an intake  session first and then meet with the skills leader or  co-leader to evaluate whether skills training is ap 

propriate for each client’s goals. Initial commitment  for skills training is obtained at this meeting. The individual pretreatment interview with the  skills trainer should orient the client to the specif ics of skills training. This includes how the group  (if there is a group) will function, what the client’s  and the trainer’s roles in skills training are, and how  skills training is different from other types of therapy In standard DBT (which includes an individual  provider), these discussions ordinarily take place  between a client and an intake coordinator (if there  is one), and then between the client and the indi vidual provider. In standard DBT, the skills trainer  usually calls and then meets new clients for 5–15  minutes before their first skills training session. If  skills training is a stand-alone intervention or if  skills are being integrated into ongoing individual  therapy, then the skills trainer performs all the tasks  that an individual provider would normally provide. 

Orienting Clients to Skills Training    
versus Other Types of Therapy 

It is essential that the leaders discuss the difference  between a skills training group and other group or  individual psychotherapies. Many individuals look  forward to a group where they can share with indi 

viduals like themselves. Although there is much shar ing in the group, it is not unlimited—and it is focused  on practicing skills, not on whatever crises may have  occurred during the week. Many participants have  never been in any kind of behavior therapy, much  less a skills-oriented group. My experience is that  the difference cannot be stressed too much. Often  clients have had an enormous amount of nonbehav ioral therapy in which they have been taught various  “necessary ingredients” for therapeutic change— ingredients that skills training often does not address  extensively. In every group we have conducted so far,  one or more clients have gotten angry about their in ability to talk about “what is really important” in the  group. For one client, talking about whatever comes  to mind was so firmly associated with the process of  therapy that she refused to acknowledge that skills  training could be a form of therapy. Needless to say,  there was much friction with her in the group. I dis cuss orienting to skills training in more detail in this  manual’s Chapters 4 and 6\. 

*Developing a Collaborative*    
*Commitment to Do Skills Training* 

Once you have decided to accept a person into skills  training, it is important that you yourself make a  commitment to treating the individual. Entering a  treatment with reluctance, reserve, or antagonism,  or on unwanted commands from others, can mark 

edly impair your chances of developing a strong and  collaborative relationship with your skills train ing participants. It is also important to talk with  potential clients about any pressures from family  members that may be the main impetus for their  coming to DBT or to skills training specifically— particularly with adolescents coming to treatment  with their parents. Because standard DBT requires  both individual therapy and skills training, it is al together possible that an individual therapist is also  pressuring a client to attend skills training. For  DBT to be effective, individuals must participate  voluntarily; thus, you may need to work with the  potential clients to see the pros and not just the cons  of coming to skills training and learning the DBT  skills offered. Remember, participation can be pres sured and voluntary at the same time. At this point,  if you accept a reluctant but mostly willing client  for treatment, the practice of radical acceptance  and opposite action will be particularly important.  Working with your DBT team will also be impor tant for strengthening your personal commitment to  the task. Follow all of the DBT guidelines on obtain ing an initial therapy commitment from skills train ing participants. These are outlined and discussed  in Chapters 9 and 14 of the main DBT text. It is  impossible to get too much commitment\! A skills  trainer should not assume that other therapists (e.g.,  the individual psychotherapist or the intake inter viewer in a clinic setting) have gotten the commit ment needed. This is a mistake my colleagues and  I made early in our program, and we paid a dear  price for it. The pretreatment session is also a good  opportunity to begin developing a personal thera peutic alliance with the client (the fifth pretreatment  task; see Chapters 14 and 15 of the main DBT text  for more on this topic). 

*Beginning to Develop the Alliance* 

Use of standard DBT therapeutic relationship strate gies, such as relationship acceptance and relation ship enhancement, is particularly important at the  start of skills training (see below). In a group con-

text, one of the first tasks of the group leaders is to  enhance the bonding between group clients and the  leaders, and to begin the process of building group  cohesion. We have found it useful to have the lead 

ers call each new group member a few days before  the first skills training meeting to remind him or her  of the session, clarify directions, and communicate  looking forward to meeting him or her. It is also  a good time for the leaders to address last-minute  fears and plans to drop out before even starting. In 

dividuals joining an ongoing group are also invited  to come early to their first session for a brief orien tation to the basics of DBT skills training. At the  session before new members join, we usually discuss  the importance of encouraging and welcoming new  members. Clients starting a module late are, in ad 

dition, given a brief review of skills already taught. The leaders should arrive a few minutes early be fore each group meeting, especially the first meeting  of a new group, to greet clients and interact briefly  with group members. For reluctant and/or fearful  clients, this can be a soothing experience. It also of fers an opportunity for leaders to hear concerns and  refute plans to leave early. We try to confine indi vidual interactions to the context of group mingling,  in order to keep the essential identity of group rather  than individual therapy. This issue is discussed fur ther below. 

As might be expected, group members are very  timid and fearful during the first meeting. Appro priate behavior is not clear, and the trustworthiness  of group clients is doubtful. We generally begin by  going around the group and asking each person to  give his or her name, to say how he or she heard  about the group, and to give any information about  him- or herself the person cares to share. The group  leaders also give information about themselves and  how they came to be leading the group. 

The next task of skills trainers is to help clients  see the relevance of a skills training model to their  own lives. An overview of the skills training treat ment year is given (see Table 2.2 in Chapter 2); a  theory of disordered emotion regulation that stress es the role of inadequate skills is presented; and the  format for the upcoming sessions is described. If the  group is homogeneous with regard to disorder or  problem type (e.g., substance use disorders, suicidal  behavior, eating disorders), then a similar skills defi cit model of the specific problem behavior is also  provided. Discussion is elicited at each point about  the relevance of the material to the client’s own ex periences. A handout (General Handout 1\) illustrat   
**3\. Structuring Skills Training Sessions**  •  49 

ing the relationship between the characteristics of  disordered emotion regulation and the goals of skills  training is distributed and discussed (see Chapter 6  of this manual for details); usually I also write this  on the whiteboard in the therapy room. 

It is essential here for the skills trainer to com municate an expectancy that the treatment will be  effective at helping the clients improve the quality  of their own lives. The treatment must be “mar keted” to clients. (See Chapters 9 and 14 of the  main DBT text for further discussion of market ing therapy to clients and eliciting commitments.)  At this time I usually make the point that DBT is  not a suicide prevention program (or substance ab stinence or symptom improvement program), but  a life enhancement program. It is not our idea to  get people to live lives not worth living, but rather  to help them build lives they actually want to live.  Dialectical and validation strategies (see Chapters  8 and 9 of the main DBT text, and Interpersonal  Effectiveness Handouts 15–19a) are the primary  treatment vehicles here. 

Relationship Acceptance 

Relationship acceptance strategies in group skills  training require that leaders experience and commu nicate acceptance of group members in several dif ferent spheres. First, the clinical progress of each cli ent must be accepted as it is. Relationships between  leaders and group members, between members and  other therapists, between and among individual  members, between the group leaders themselves,  and between the group as a whole and the group  leaders must also be accepted. The sheer complex ity of the situation can make acceptance difficult,  because it is easy to get overwhelmed; rigidity and  nonacceptance usually follow. It is essential to try  not to pave over or quickly truncate conflict and dif ficult emotions in the group. Many clients who have  trouble regulating their emotions also have great  difficulty with group skills training. Some are in  it only because it is required, and they feel uncom fortable and are unable to interact effectively in this  atmosphere. For others, skills seem unimportant,  juvenile, or silly. Still others quickly become demor alized by unsuccessful attempts to master the skills. 

Group skills training with clients who have dif ficulties regulating their emotions does not have the  naturally occurring reinforcement for leaders that  most groups have. Skills training leaders are faced  with dead silences; noncompliance; inappropriate   
50  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

and sometimes extreme responses to the slightest  deviation from perfect sensitivity; and a group at mosphere that at times can be uncommunicative,  hostile, unsupportive, and unappreciative. The po tential for mistakes in leading such a group is vast. A  leader can expect not only to make many mistakes,  but also to be acutely aware of the many mistakes  the other group leader makes. Reality acceptance  skills are crucial if mistakes are to be responded to  in a nondestructive manner. 

Leaders’ attacking group members or threaten ing them is almost always a result of a failure in  relationship acceptance. Acceptance requires a non judgmental attitude that sees all problems as part of  the therapeutic process—“grist for the mill,” so to  speak. Leaders simply have to see that most prob lematic responses on the part of the group derive  from emotionally dysregulated response patterns. In  other words, if clients didn’t present with the prob lems that drive leaders crazy, they wouldn’t need a  skills training group. To the extent that leaders fail  to recognize this fact, they are likely to engage in  rejecting, victim-bashing behaviors that may be too  subtle to be seen for what they are, but nonetheless  have an iatrogenic effect. In other words, an “easy”  leader disposition has to be either innate or culti vated. 

Relationship Enhancement 

Relationship enhancement strategies involve behav iors by skills trainers that increase the therapeutic  values of the relationship. In other words, they are  behaviors that make the relationship more than sim ply a helpful friendship. A positive, collaborative  interpersonal relationship is no less important in  skills training than it is in any other type of therapy.  However, the development of such a relationship is  considerably more complex in group skills train ing, because of the increased number of individu als involved in the relationship. The question for the  group leaders is how to establish such a relation ship between group members and leaders, as well as  among the members themselves. 

All of the DBT strategies are designed in one way  or another to enhance the collaborative working re lationship. The strategies discussed here are those  intended primarily to establish the group leaders  as experts, as creditable, and as efficacious. Thus  the goal of these strategies is to communicate to the  group members that the leaders indeed know what  they are doing and have something to offer that will  

probably be helpful to the group members. This is  no easy task. The task is made even more difficult by  the fact that group members often share with one an other their previous failures in individual and other  group therapies, and comment about the hopeless ness of their situations and the meagerness of any  help that can be offered. Group members often por tray their problems as Goliath and the treatment as  David, but without David’s Old Testament success.  The task of the leaders is to convey the story as it  indeed occurred. 

Expertise, credibility, and efficacy can be con veyed in a variety of ways. Skills trainers’ neatness,  professionalism, interest, comfort, self-confidence,  speech style, and preparation for therapy sessions  are no less useful in skills training than in indi vidual psychotherapy. It is especially important in  conducting groups to have the group room prepared  before the group members arrive: Handouts and  worksheets should be distributed; chairs should be  in place; and the refreshments should be made and  available (if refreshments are provided). The key to  the credibility problem, in my experience, is that  many clients—particularly those with severe and  chronic disorders—simply do not believe that learn ing the skills presented will in fact be helpful. This  disbelief detracts from any positive motivation to  learn the skills, and unless clients learn the skills  and obtain positive rewards, it is difficult to change  

this attitude. Indeed, this dynamic can become a vi cious circle. 

Leaders must come up with a way to break this  vicious circle if the clients are to move forward. The  most helpful approach is for the leaders to tell group  members that in their experience, these skills have  been helpful to some people some of the time. This,  of course, can only be said if it is indeed the lead 

ers’ experience; leaders who have never taught these  skills must rely on others’ experience. (Our outcome  data can form a database for inexperienced skills  trainers.) In addition, leaders can share their own  experience with skills. For some clients, the most  powerful inducement to learn the skills is the knowl 

edge that the leaders have found the skills helpful for  themselves. 

Credibility is damaged when leaders promise that  a particular skill will solve a particular problem.  In fact, DBT is something of a shotgun approach:  Some of the skills work some of the time for some  of the people. I have not had any clients to date who  could not benefit from something, but no one ben 

efits from everything. It is crucial to present this in-

formation; otherwise, the leaders’ credibility is on  the line immediately. 

Another key issue to address is that of trust and  confidentiality. Opportunities to display trustwor thiness occur when one member is absent from a  group session. At all times, confidences must be  kept, and unnecessary information about a group  member should not be conveyed when that group  member is absent. The absence of a group mem ber, however, can serve as a powerful opportunity  for enhancing other group members’ trust in the  leaders. The manner in which the absent member  is discussed conveys information to all other mem bers about how they will be treated when they are  absent. Generally, the policy should be to protect  group members from negative judgments. For ex ample, if a group member blows up, walks out of a  session, and slams the door, the leaders can respond  to the event with sympathetic explanations rather  than with critical judgments. 

This same strategy, of course, can be used when  all group members are present. It is not unusual  for one group member to behave in a fashion that  the leaders know will result in negative judgments  by other group members. Or other group members  may be quite critical of one another. The leaders’  role here is that of protectors of the accused and the  judged. This leadership task cannot be overempha 

sized, especially during the clients’ first modules in  skills training. Not only does this approach serve to  model nonjudgmental observation and description  of problematic behavior for group members; but it  also conveys to all of the members that when they  are attacked, they too will be protected. The most  useful way to convey expertness and credibility is,  of course, to be helpful. Thus the leaders need to  think through skills that have a high likelihood of  working with a particular group member. A skill  that is working should be highlighted so that the  member will also see the benefits. 

Skills trainer credibility in standard DBT group  skills training is further complicated by the fact  that there are two group leaders. In my clinic, the  co-leader is usually a trainee who, in fact, does not  have the expertise of the primary leader. It is es 

sential that the primary leader not undermine the  credibility and expertness of the co-leader. It is im portant for the inexperienced co-leader to find his  or her emotional center and act from there. It is this  inner-centeredness, rather than any particular set of  therapeutic skills, that is most important. The pri mary leader and co-leader do not need to have the

same set of skills or to convey expertise in the same  areas. The dialectical perspective as a whole is what  counts. 

Presenting Skills Training Guidelines 

Make the rules of skills training explicit at the very  beginning. Their presentation is an important part  of the treatment process, not a precursor to the pro cess and it offers an opportunity for the skills train ers to specify and obtain agreement to the treatment  contract from each client. My experience is that  the presentation and discussion of rules can usu ally be accomplished at the beginning of each itera tion of the mindfulness module. In an open group,  the guidelines should be discussed each time a new  member enters the group. Guidelines I have found  useful are outlined in General Handout 3 and de scribed below. 

**1\. *Participants who drop out of skills training  are NOT out of skills training.*** Only clients who  miss 4 weeks of scheduled skills training sessions in  a row have dropped out of therapy and cannot re 

enter for the duration of the time in their treatment  contract. For example, if a client has contracted for  1 year, but misses 4 weeks in a row during the sixth  month, then he or she is out for the next 6 months or  so. At the end of the contracted time, he or she can  negotiate with the skills trainer(s) (and the group, if  he or she was in one and it is continuing) about re 

admission. There are no exceptions to this rule. The  rule for skills training is thus the same as the rule for  individual DBT psychotherapy. 

Across multiple studies using this rule, our drop out rates in 1-year DBT programs have been rea sonably low. I suspect that our emphasis on a time limited commitment and the clarity of the rules  

about how to drop out are crucial to our low drop out rate. 

**2\. *Participants who join the skills training group  support each other.*** There are many ways to be a  supportive person in skills training sessions. It is im portant that skills leaders review what is needed to  be supportive. This includes preserving confidenti ality, attending regularly, practicing skills between  sessions, validating others, giving noncritical feed back, and being willing to accept help from a per son (a leader or a fellow client) from whom help is  requested. 

A good group norm of coming on time and prac ticing skills between sessions is essential—but ad-  
52  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

mittedly hard at times to develop. Discussing the im portance of building norms at the start of each new  module can be very helpful. My experience is that  most skills training members want such norms to  develop. (We have found it very effective to give out  stickers to each person who comes to skills training  on time that week.) 

**3\. *Participants who are going to be late or miss  a session call ahead of time.*** 

This rule serves several purposes. First, it is a  courtesy to let skills trainers know not to wait for  latecomers before starting. Second, it introduces an  added response cost for being late and communi 

cates to clients that promptness is desirable. Finally,  it gives information as to why a client is not present. **4\. *Participants do not tempt others to engage  in problem behaviors.*** This rule asks clients not to  come to skills sessions under the influence of drugs  or alcohol. However, if drugs or alcohol have al ready been used, clients are to come to the sessions  acting clean and sober. Particularly for those with  substance use disorders, a rule saying not to come  to skills sessions when using substances just gives  individuals with poor self-regulation a good excuse  for not coming. Instead, my position is that skills  learning is context-dependent, and thus for persons  with substance use disorders, learning and practic ing skills while under the influence of drugs or alco hol are particularly important. This is definitely the  time when skills are needed. 

This rule also outlaws descriptions of dysfunc tional behaviors, which can be contagious. In my  experience, communications about self-injury, sub stance use, bingeing or purging, and similar behav iors elicit strong imitation effects among individuals  with disordered emotion regulation. These urges to  imitate can be very difficult to resist. Therefore, just  as in individual DBT, clients in skills training must  agree not to call or communicate with one another  *after* a self-injurious act. At every point in DBT, a  major objective is to diminish the opportunity for  reinforcement of dysfunctional behaviors. This is  particularly true for discussions of suicidal behav iors. 

**5\. *Participants do not form confidential rela tionships outside of skills training sessions*.** The  key word in the fifth rule is “confidential.” Clients  may not form relationships outside the sessions that  they cannot discuss in the sessions. DBT encour ages outside-of-session relationships among group  clients. In fact, the support that members can give  one another with daily problems in living is one  

of the strengths of group DBT. The model here is  similar to that of Alcoholics Anonymous and other  self-help groups, where calling one another between  meetings, socializing, and offering mutual support  are viewed as therapeutic. Encouragement of such  relationships, however, provides the possibility for  interpersonal conflict that is inherent in any rela 

tionship. The key is whether interpersonal problems  that arise outside the sessions can be discussed in  the sessions (or, if that is too difficult or threatens to  get out of hand, with the leaders). To the extent that  such issues can be discussed and appropriate skills  can be applied, a relationship can be advantageous.  Troubles arise when a relationship cannot be dis 

cussed and problems increase to such an extent that  one member finds it difficult or impossible to attend  meetings, either physically or emotionally. 

Group leaders should assign current sexual part ners to different groups at the onset. This rule also  functions to alert group members that if they enter  into a sexual relationship, one member of the pair  will have to drop out. To date we have had several  sexual relationships begin among group members;  each created enormous difficulties for the partners  involved. In one case, the initiating partner broke  off the relationship against the wishes of the other,  making it very hard for the rejected partner to come  to group sessions. Generally, this rule is clear to ev 

eryone involved. Without the rule, however, deal ing with an emerging sexual relationship between  clients is very tricky, since post hoc application of  rules is unworkable with individuals who have dys regulated emotions. 

There are two exceptions to the rule. In skills  training groups for friends and families, where cou ples, partners, and multiple family members often  join the group, it is not reasonable or feasible to out law private relationships. A similar situation arises  in the multifamily skills groups commonly held  with adolescents. In these situations, however, it is  important to note that when relationship conflicts  threaten the group, the leaders will approach it in a  manner similar to that described above. 

**6\. *Participants who are suicidal and/or have se vere disorders must be in ongoing individual treat ment.*** This rule is ordinarily discussed with clients  during pretreatment (rather than during a group ses sion), and the requirement to be in individual treat ment is laid out at that time. Of note here is that  these clients must actually meet with their individu al therapists on a regular basis to stay in skills train ing. If the clients are in individual DBT treatment, 

then they cannot miss four scheduled individual ses sions in a row. If they are in another form of individ ual therapy, then the attendance guidelines of that  treatment must be followed. The exception to this  rule is when clients are on a waiting list for therapy.  Data collected by a Canadian research team found  that skills training alone was effective in reducing  suicide attempts in suicidal individuals on a treat ment waiting list.3 

This early emphasis on the likely need of highly  dysregulated and/or suicidal participants for extra  help in mastering the skills is very important later  when the clients run into difficulty. It is all too easy  for the skills trainers to overestimate the ease of  learning skills; such overestimation sets the clients  up for later disillusionment and hopelessness. 

DBT skills training does not require that the in dividual therapist be a DBT therapist. Nonetheless,  the requirement for individual therapy can still be  quite formidable at times. In our experience, it is  not uncommon for individual therapists in the com munity to get pushed past their limits by clients  with dysregulated emotions, and then to terminate  therapy precipitously with these clients. When this  happens, it can be extraordinarily difficult to find  an individual therapist willing to work with such  clients, especially with those who are mourning the  loss of previous therapists. This is especially prob lematic when the clients cannot afford to pay the  high fees often charged by professionals who are  experienced enough to be helpful. Unfortunately,  many public health clinics are so understaffed that  they cannot provide individual psychotherapy, or  

clients may have already burned out their local clin ics. In these cases, the skills training leaders often  must function as short-term backup crisis therapists  and assist the clients in finding appropriate individ ual therapists. 

Presenting DBT Assumptions 

The assumptions underlying treatment are outlined  in General Handout 4 and described below. Along  with the skills training guidelines, they are present ed and discussed with skills participants during ori entation (which is repeated before the start of each  Mindfulness skills module) and in person with cli ents who join a skills group after the first session of  a module. An “assumption” is a belief that cannot  be proved, but group members agree to abide by it  anyway. DBT across the board is based on the fol lowing assumptions.   
**3\. Structuring Skills Training Sessions**  •  53 

**1\. *People are doing the best they can.*** The idea  here is that all people at any given point in time are  doing the best they can, given the causes of behavior  that have occurred up to this moment. 

**2\. *People want to improve****.* The common char acteristic of all people is that they want to improve  their lives. As noted by the Dalai Lama at a meeting  I was part of, a common characteristic of all people  is that they want to be happy. 

**3\. *\*People need to do better, try harder, and be  more motivated to change.*** The fact that someone is  doing the best he or she can and wants to do even  better does not mean that this is enough to solve the  problem. (The asterisk here means that this is not  always true. In particular, when progress is steady  and is occurring at a realistic rate, with no let-up or  episodic drop in effort, doing better, trying harder,  and being more motivated are not needed.) 

**4\. \**People may not have caused all of their own  problems, but they have to solve them anyway.*** Peo ple have to change their own behavioral responses  and alter their environment for their lives to change.  (The asterisk here indicates that with children or  disabled persons, others might be needed to solve  some problems. For example, young children can not get themselves to treatment if parents or others  refuse to take them.) 

**5\. *New behavior has to be learned in all relevant  contexts.*** New behavioral skills have to be practiced  in the situations where the skills are needed, not just  in the situation where the skills are first learned. 

**6\. *All behaviors (actions, thoughts, emotions)  are caused.*** There is always a cause or set of causes  for actions, thoughts, and emotions, even if people  do not know what the causes are. 

**7\. *Figuring out and changing the causes of be havior is a more effective way to change than judg ing and blaming.*** Judging and blaming are easier,  but anyone who wants to create change in the world  has to change the chains of events that cause un wanted behaviors and events. 

Format and Organization    
of Ongoing Skills Training Sessions 

The structuring of session time is the major factor  differentiating formal DBT skills training from DBT  individual psychotherapy. In individual DBT psy chotherapy, the agenda is set by a client’s behavior  since the last session and within the current session;  the agenda is open until the client shows up for the   
54  •  **I. AN INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS TRAINING** 

session. In skills training, the therapy agenda is set  by the behavioral skill to be taught; the agenda is set  before a client shows up for the session. 

Skills training sessions require at least four sec tions: (1) a beginning ritual, (2) review of homework  practice since the last session, (3) presentation of  new material, and (4) a closing “wind-down.” In my  clinic, skills training sessions for individuals with  severe disorders (including BPD) last for 2½ hours,  generally with a 15-minute break in the middle. The  format is reasonably consistent for the whole year.  The sessions begin with a mindfulness exercise, fol lowed by group members’ sharing their attempts (or  lack of attempts) to practice behavioral skills dur ing the preceding week, followed by a break. The  second hour is devoted to presenting and discuss ing new skills. The last 15 minutes are allotted to  a session wind-down, which involves going around  the room and having each person share one observa tion about the session (a practice of the mindfulness  skills of observing and describing). 

This format varies slightly for the final session of  each module. Instead of presenting new material,  that session’s second half is devoted to a review of  all the skills from that module; a review of skills  from the previous modules; and a discussion of pros  and cons of using the skills and skill generalization  across situations and contexts in participants’ lives.  The session concludes with a wind-down, which can  consist of observations about the module as a whole  and how the weeks and sessions on the module went. 

If any individuals are leaving the skills training  group, there is time set aside to say goodbye and  discuss termination issues. Generally, we ask those  leaving for ideas on snacks for the last meeting, and  also let them choose the mindfulness practice at the  beginning of the group. We give (standing with the  participant by our side) each graduating person a  graduation certificate signed by the two co-leaders  and a graduation card with personal notes from  each leader. Unless there is a good reason for not  doing so, we end the session with each person given  an opportunity to say a personal good bye. In sum,  you want to give departing participants a positive  sendoff. 

In our friends-and-family program and in skills  training for participants with less severe disorders,  groups last from 90 minutes to 2 hours. Adolescent  groups also last from 90 minutes to 2 hours. Indi 

vidual skills training sessions ordinarily last 45–60  minutes. In each case, however, the general four part structure of sessions is the same as outlined in  

Table 3.4. Each of the four sections is discussed in  more detail below. 

Some inpatient settings have split this format in  two, holding two weekly sessions—one devoted to  homework review and one devoted to new skills.  This is a reasonable model on inpatient and day  treatment units, where staff members have some  ability to persuade clients to attend both weekly ses 

sions. In an outpatient setting, however, there is a  danger that clients will not attend homework review  sessions when they have not practiced any of their  skills during the preceding week. Skills trainers will  want to prevent that from occurring. 

Other settings have shortened the session time,  usually from 2½ to 1½ hours. In my clinic’s experi ence with adults with severe behavioral and emo tional dyscontrol, 1½ hours is not enough time for a  group session. Even with 2½ hours, 50–60 minutes  for homework review with eight group members  gives each member about 6–8 minutes of group at tention—not very much. Nor is 50–60 minutes for  new material much time, either. Although group  leaders can present a lot of material in that time,  they also need time to do in-session practice of new  skills, to discuss questions about the week’s new  content, to check skill comprehension with each  member, and to go over new homework sheets to be  sure that clients understand how to do the practice  and how to record it. Individual skills training can  be accomplished in weekly 45- to 50-minute ses sions. 

*Session Room Setup and Materials* 

It is important to set up the room for skills train ing sessions differently from what is usually done  for traditional group or individual therapy. To the  degree possible, the aim should be to elicit a sense  of being in a classroom. We conduct our group ses sions in a conference room around a table, with a  whiteboard for the skills trainers to write on. For

individual skills training, we bring in a small desk  for the client to sit at; if this is not possible, we teach  individual skills in a room different from the indi vidual therapy room. Skills training handouts and  worksheets for all modules to be taught are given  out in three-ring binders with pockets in front and  back. Handouts are printed on one color of paper,  and worksheets on another color. Generally, we try  not to use white paper, as it makes it more difficult  for those with dyslexia to read. We also use labeled  dividers between sections and between handouts  and worksheets within sections. In the front binder  pockets, we put forms to track weekly practice as 

signments; in the back pockets, we put a supply of  DBT diary cards. The diary card lists the most im portant DBT skills taught. Next to each skill on the  card is a space for recording whether or not the cli ent actually practiced the skill on each day during  the week. (See Chapter 4 and Figure 4.1 for more  details about the diary card, as well as Chapter 6 of  the main DBT text.) Pencils/pens for taking notes  are available on the table. Clients are instructed to  bring in their binders each week. Loaner binders are  available if they forget their own. 

Other materials to bring to the session include a  small bell that can be rung to start and end mindful ness practices, and a selection of distress tolerance  tools (e.g., cold gel pack, rubber ball with spikes,  balance board) for use by people who may be in  danger of dissociating during the sessions. It can  also be useful to record sessions on video, if the nec essary equipment is available. (For more on this, see  the discussion in Chapter 4 on managing the home work review.) 

At our group sessions, we serve decaffeinated cof fee and tea (and usually snacks as well). Before the  beginning ritual, members get coffee or tea and a  snack and get settled. In our groups, if people want  to bring their own snacks, then they have to bring  enough to share with everyone. 

*Session-Beginning Ritual* 

We begin with the session leader or co-leader lead ing a mindfulness practice. An effort is made to vary  the practices so that over the weeks we practice each  of the mindfulness skills. Mindfulness practices are  listed on Mindfulness Handouts 4a–4c and 5a–5c.  We start each practice by ringing the mindfulness  bell three times, and end it by ringing the bell once.  Then we go around the room and ask each partici pant (including the leader and co-leader) to share    
**3\. Structuring Skills Training Sessions**  •  55 

his or her experience with the group. This sharing  is very important, as it does not take much time  and gives the leader or co-leader a chance to pro vide corrective feedback if needed. If members have  missed one or more previous sessions, they are given  a chance to tell the group where they have been. If  missing sessions is a problem for a person, attention  (no more than 5 minutes or so) can be paid to ana lyzing what interferes with coming and how to over come it. If there are group issues (e.g., announce ments; not calling when missing; or coming late),  they are dealt with at the beginning of the session.  This brief attention to therapy-interfering behaviors  

is very important and should not be dropped. A therapist who is conducting individual skills  training should follow the session-beginning guide lines in Chapter 14 of the main DBT text—greeting  the client with warmth; attending, if only briefly, to  the client’s current emotional state; and repairing re lationship difficulties at the beginning of a session if  needed. Only a limited amount of time should then  be spent on beginning strategies. If possible, the  therapist should help the client use his or her distress  tolerance crisis survival strategies (see Chapter 10 of  this manual) to manage current emotions if extreme  and distract from the need for further repair, do  skills training, and get back to repair at the end of  the session or at the next individual psychotherapy  meeting. 

*Review of Homework:*    
*Sharing of Homework Practice Efforts* 

The next phase of treatment is the sharing of  between-session efforts to practice the specific be havioral skills (mindfulness, interpersonal effective ness, emotion regulation, distress tolerance) being  taught. In our group sessions, the primary group  leader goes around the circle and asks each member  to share with the group what he or she has prac ticed during the preceding week. In my experience,  waiting for members to volunteer takes up too much  time. However, I may let members decide who to  start with in going around the circle. Vocabulary  can be very important here. Behaviorists are used to  calling practice “homework,” and therefore to ask ing clients about their “homework practice.” Some  of our clients like this terminology and prefer to  think of skills training as a class they are taking,  much like a college course. Others feel demeaned by  the words, as if they are being treated like children  in school and once again having to report to adults.
