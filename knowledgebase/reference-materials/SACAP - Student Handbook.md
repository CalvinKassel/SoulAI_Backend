SACAP Student Handbook 2022 6

SECTION 1:

WELCOME AND GENERAL INFORMATION

SACAP maintains the highest possible educational and ethical standards
in the delivery of its courses and curriculum and closely monitors the
delivery of its educational services through the systems and processes
described in this guide. This guide has been written for SACAP students
for you to familiarise yourself with College policies and procedures.
Whether you are studying full-time or part-time, whether you are
studying on one of SACAP's campuses or are a part of one of SACAP's
online programmes, as a student of the College you will embark on a
process of learning that is experiential, interactive and dynamic. The
training you will receive is intended to provide you with skills and
knowledge that will enable the realisation of your particular learning
goals. To achieve the most out of your qualification it is important
that you carefully read this Student Handbook to familiarise yourself
with College policies and procedures. This Student Handbook also
provides quick and easy access to many of the student services that are
offered through the College.

SACAP's Registered Name and Legal Status The South African College of
Applied Psychology (Pty) Ltd (SACAP) is registered with the Department
of Higher Education and Training as a Private Higher Education
Institution (PHEI) in terms of section 54 (1) (c) under the Higher
Education Act, 1997 (Act 101 of 1997), and regulation 16 (4) (a) of the
regulations for the registration of Private Higher Education
Institutions, 2002. Registration Certificate Number: 2005/HE07/001. The
South African College of Applied Psychology (Proprietary) Limited is
also certified as incorporated under the Companies Act, 1973, (Act 61 of
1973) (as a company having a share capital). Company Registration
Number: 2003/019020/07

Language Policy Language has been and continues to be a barrier to
access and success in higher education. In recognition of this, and as
stated in the National Plan for Higher Education (2001), SACAP is
committed to ensuring that language should not act as a barrier to
equity of access and success in higher education. The minimum entrance
requirement for SACAP's English Proficiency is a National Senior
Certificate with a minimum of 45% in English. SACAP is committed to
developing strategies over time to assist students who register for any
of its programmes to ensure that students have a solid grasp of both
written and spoken English. Since all academic activities at SACAP are
conducted in English, it is essential that all students possess strong
writing and speaking skills. This allows students to cope with the
rigours of the academic curriculum and to successfully complete their
studies. In general, students should have a minimum of three years of
full-time study in a school system where English is considered the
primary language (i.e. the primary language of instruction and
evaluation is English), with acceptable grades in all English courses.
Alternatively, for students who apply from other/alternative primary
language institutions e.g., Afrikaans speaking institutions, should have
a minimum of three years of full-time study in a school \* Please Note:
At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any given
situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 7

system where English is considered the secondary language. Applicants
whose first language is another South African language or foreign
language, must present transcripts to indicate that they have taken
three years of English at a secondary education level (or equivalent) in
order to be admitted to SACAP. Those who apply to SACAP from further or
higher education institutions where English is a secondary language,
should have a minimum of one full year of successful study in an
accredited university degree programme, or two full years of successful
study in an accredited college diploma programme, where English was the
primary language of instruction and evaluation. If a student's first
language is not English, or if their previous education (school or
otherwise) has been conducted in another language, they may be required
to demonstrate proficiency in English by undertaking an English literacy
assessment, such as the English Literacy Skills Assessment (ELSA) 1 as
part of the application process to gauge competency, the results of
which must be submitted to SACAP. The above requirements are general
guidelines only. SACAP reserves the right to require a successfully
completed language proficiency test based on the requirements of the
specific programme being applied for. For admission purposes, some
programmes require a higher English language score than the minimums
stated above.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 9

b.

Save as where otherwise resolved by the Board, SACAP's managing director
shall serve, ex officio, as the Records Manager.

c.  

The Records Manager shall take reasonable measures to ensure that
Personal Information is identified, classified, retained, stored,
protected and disposed of in such a manner that its integrity is not

Personal Information is prevented.

d.  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither SACAP nor the Records Manager,
shall be liable under any circumstances for any loss or damage sustained
as a result of unlawful access to or dissemination of any Personal
Information.

Audio and/or Video Recordings in the Teaching and Learning Environment
SACAP does not permit audio or video recording within the Teaching and
Learning environment for the following reasons: 

SACAP's classroom environment enables the facilitation of teaching and
learning in a confidential, safe space where students are able to share
experiences so as to further enrich their learning. Opening these
sessions to recordings, will negate the confidentiality of this space
and may have further ethical concerns.



To protect the Intellectual Property (IP) of SACAP and its educators and
supervisors.



Students who require class recordings for reasons such as, but not
limited to, impairments, disabilities and medical conditions, are to
submit a formal written request to the Student Services Department. This
request will be processed as a concession request (See Concession
Request).

Communicating with SACAP While every effort is made to respond to
student emails promptly, SACAP, including its educators and staff, has a
two working day (48 hours) response time in which to reply to emails. In
the event that the matter is urgent, please contact Reception
telephonically on the relevant campus with a description of the query or
concern so that the matter can be escalated.

Fire and Emergency Evacuation Procedures In case of a fire or emergency
students and educators are asked to please evacuate the building and go
directly to the closest fire exits and await instructions from the
Health and Safety Officer or Fire Marshal on duty. Students and
educators are asked to please familiarise themselves with the relevant
escape plans on the back of classroom doors and note the locations of
the fire extinguishers and fire exits.

Campus and Campus Building Property Students, educators and visitors are
advised that they will be held liable for any wilful and/or accidental
damage caused to campus/campus building property. This does not include
reasonable wear and tear, which accounts for the natural deterioration
in the condition of campus/campus building property caused by normal,
everyday usage.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 10

Campus Security Students are advised to take every precaution necessary
when walking to and from their respective campuses as SACAP cannot be
held responsible for student safety off-campus. All SACAP campuses have
been fitted with security cameras and alarm systems with armed response
in addition to the security provided by the respective campuses
Building's Management. SACAP has done its best to ensure that the
College is a safe environment to study in; however, it cannot control
the number of people visiting the campus daily. In addition to staff,
educators, and students, the College also has a number of visitors,
enquirers, and service providers coming onto SACAP's campuses daily.
Students are asked to be careful about safeguarding their personal
belongings, and not to leave their cell phones, media devices, bags,
laptops or any other valuable possessions unattended. Students are asked
to take every effort to ensure their personal belongings' safety. SACAP
cannot be held responsible for the loss or damage of any personal
belonging left unattended or unsupervised.

Student ID/Access Card Students studying at SACAP are issued with a
Student ID/Access Card. The card may entitle students to various
concessions (movies, public galleries, etc.). Lost or stolen cards may
be replaced for a fee. The cards issued to on campus students provide
the student with access to all of the campus facilities. Online students
who wish to come on campus to utilise campus facilities should inform
the Online Mentor who can then refer the student to the relevant campus
receptionist to arrange an access card.

Student Admission Prior to the enrolment period, potential students are
provided with current and accurate information about College
qualifications, entry procedures and financial implications. Students
apply for entry to the College by fair and open procedures with
published criteria outlining entry requirements for all courses. The
principles upon which admission decisions are made are stated clearly
and adhered to by College personnel. It is however important to note
that the College reserves the "Right of Admission".

Credit Accumulation and Transfer (CAT) and Recognition of Prior Learning
(RPL) Policy In line with national higher education policies published
by the Council on Higher Education (CHE) and the South African
Qualifications Authority (SAQA), the processes of Credit Accumulation
and Transfer (CAT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) both aim to
promote better access for students to higher education learning in South
Africa, including those who were previously deprived of access to formal
learning environments. This policy provides a quality assurance
framework for the recognition of prior informal and nonformal learning
within RPL, as well as of formal learning within CAT, with the exception
of situations where CAT is found not to be applicable. A complete module
of an academic programme is the smallest learning unit for which credits
may be exempted or transferred. As such, advanced standing, exemption
and credit transfer may be granted on a per-module basis. \* Please
Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any given
situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 11

SACAP reserves the right to accept or reject applications based on the
specific programme requirements, module or programme learning outcomes,
or institutional policy.

Exceptions to this policy In accordance with the Higher Education
Qualifications Sub-Framework (HEQSF, 2013), students must complete at
least all of the required credits at the exit level of a qualification.
As such, CAT for module credit or RPL for module advanced
standing/exemption cannot be granted in the final year of a
qualification or for any exit level qualification. This includes: 

The second (final) year of the Diploma in Counselling and Communication
Skills;



The third (final) year of the Bachelor of Applied Social Science;



The fourth (final) year of the Bachelor of Social Work;



The fourth (final) year of the Bachelor of Psychology; and



For all of the following exit level qualifications: o

Higher Certificate in Counselling and Communication Skills;

o

Advanced Certificate in Counselling and Communication Skills;

o

Bachelor of Social Science Honours in Psychology (including the BPsych
Equivalent Programme);

o

Bachelor of Social Science Honours in Human Resource Management;

o

Postgraduate Diploma in Coaching; and

o

Master of Social Science in Community Mental Health Promotion.

In addition, based on experiential learning requirements, CAT or RPL for
module exemption is also not permitted for any Work Integrated Learning
(WIL) module within any programme.

Professional Programmes: Professional Bodies have the right to deny CAT
or RPL for module exemption for any professional programme for which
they are responsible for, accredit and/or endorse.

Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA): Professional Board
of Psychology The Regulations laid out by the HPCSA's Professional Board
of Psychology is clearly outlined in Form 258 which guides the Framework
for Education, Training, Registration and Scope of Registered
Counsellors. This document stipulates that: "Registration as a
Registered Counsellor is contingent on completion of: An accredited
4-year BPsych, or Honours degree in Psychology accredited by the Board
as equivalent to the BPsych degree that incorporates an approved 6
month/720-hour face-to-face practicum". Furthermore, in terms of the
Regulations relating to the Registration of Student Registered
Counsellors, published in the Government Notice No. 287 of 9 October
2012, all students registered into an Honours degree in Psychology
accredited by the Professional Board of Psychology as equivalent to the
BPsych degree, which incorporates an approved 6 month/720 hour
face-to-face practicum (i.e. SACAP's Bachelor of Social Science Honours
in Psychology \[BPsych Equivalent

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 12

Programme\]), have to be registered as student Registered Counsellors
from the outset of the programme and complete it in its entirety.
Therefore, the HPCSA's Professional Board of Psychology has does not
permit CAT or RPL for module exemption for the following professional
psychology programme: 

Bachelor of Social Science Honours in Psychology \[BPsych Equivalent
Programme\]

Students are required to register as Student Registered Counsellors at
the outset of the professional programmes and are required to complete
them in their entirety, including all Practicum requirements.

Credit Accumulation and Transfer (CAT) Definition of terms: Credit

Refers to the measure of the volume of learning required for a
qualification and can be specified in terms of the total minimum number
of credits required for a qualification, as well as the minimum number
of credits specified for the exit level of a qualification. One credit
is the equivalent of ten notional hours of study.

Notional hours

Indicate the estimated learning time taken by an 'average' student to
achieve the specified learning outcomes of a module or qualification.
Notional hours include all the learning activities, including
self-study, that make up a module.

Credit Refers to the totalling of credits towards the completion of a
qualification. accumulation Credit transfer

Refers to the vertical, horizontal or diagonal relocation of credits
towards a given qualification.

General Principles of CAT CAT ensures that students are able to receive
formal recognition and certification of a learning achievement. This
allows for articulation across the higher education sub-frameworks of
the NQF in order to facilitate lifelong learning and provide mobility
for students so that they can enhance their changes of successfully
completing their qualifications. CAT is the process whereby credits
obtained at one institution may be recognised by another, or the same,
as meeting part of the requirements for a qualification provided that
the content, learning outcomes, NQF level and credit range, are the same
or judged to be equivalent. CAT applies to qualifications no older than
5 years at the time of the initial registration with SACAP. The CAT
application process must be initiated on application for admission and
can be continued within the student's first term of study in cases where
documentation for such application is pending. General rules of CAT in
line with the Council on Higher Education (CHE) and Higher Education
Qualifications Sub-Framework (HEQSF) regulations: 

Any and all credits of an incomplete qualification from SACAP or another
institution may be recognised as meeting part (up to 50% maximum) of the
requirements for the same or a different qualification at SACAP.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 13



Up to 50% of the credits of a completed qualification from SACAP or
another institution may be recognised as meeting part (up to 50%
maximum) of the requirements for the same or a different qualification
at SACAP.



A maximum of 50% of the credits of a completed qualification may be
transferred to another qualification, if no more than 50% of the credits
required for the other qualification are credits that have been used for
a completed qualification. This prevents awarding multiple
qualifications for the same work completed.



The point of entry in a qualification must be such that students must
complete all of the required credits at the exit level of that
qualification, i.e. the final year of a qualification or a qualification
that is made up of only one NQF level (i.e. the exit level) does not
allow for CAT, e.g. The 2nd year of the Diploma, the 3rd/4th year of an
undergraduate degree, the Higher Certificate, Advanced Certificate,
BSocSciHons, PGDC, and MSocSci (see exemption clause above).

Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) Definition of terms: Advanced
standing

The status granted to a student for admission to study at a level higher
than the student's prior knowledge and skills and/or formal studies
would normally allow.

Exemption

Is granted where the applicant is deemed to have successfully completed
prior learning deemed equivalent to the module being waived. As such,
the student will complete fewer modules overall to receive a given
qualification.

Assessment

Is the systematic evaluation of an applicant's ability to demonstrate
their achievement of the specified competencies or learning outcomes
intended for a given module or curriculum.

General Principles of RPL: RPL aims to overcome potential barriers to
admission or registration, for higher education qualifications for those
who do not have the formal prerequisites with regard to educational
opportunities. It should be based on the principles of equity, access,
inclusivity and redress of past discrimination with regard to
educational opportunities, while still protecting the quality standards
of higher education qualifications. RPL gives due recognition to the
life-long learning of an individual gained through formal, informal,
non-formal knowledge and training, and/or work experience. General rules
of RPL in line with Council on Higher Education (CHE) and Higher
Education Qualifications Sub-Framework (HEQSF) regulations: 

RPL is a process of assessment that evaluates informal and non-formal
knowledge into formal and structured equivalents based on specified
competencies.



RPL may only be used to grant access to a qualification, or advanced
standing/exemption from modules within a given qualification.



No credits can be awarded for modules that a student has been exempted
from based on RPL. As such, the total number of end credits will be less
than the normally required number of credits for a qualification.



RPL cannot be used to grant exemption from more than 50% of the modules
of a given qualification.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 14



Students must complete ALL of the required credits at the exit level of
a qualification, i.e. a qualification made up of only one NQF level
(i.e. the exit level) does not allow for RPL for advanced
standing/exemption for modules, i.e. Higher Certificate, Advanced
Certificate, BSocSciHons, PGDC, and MSocSci.



No more than 10% of a cohort of students may be admitted in to a higher
education programme through RPL.



The age for admission into a qualification on the basis of RPL is 24
years and older. Applicants 24 years of age and older who do not meet
the minimum entrance requirements of a qualification should provide a
portfolio of evidence demonstrating formal, informal, and non-formal
knowledge, training, work experience, and/or learning equivalent to the
minimum entrance requirements of the intended qualification to support
admission into the programme on the basis of RPL.

The Recognition of Prior Learning process can be applied in two ways: i.

Admission into a qualification: On the basis of age (where applicable),
and where there is evidence of other forms of prior learning that are
evaluated for equivalence against the minimum entrance requirements of a
qualification.

ii. 

Advanced standing/exemption for particular module(s) in a qualification
(not applicable for exit level qualifications): Evidence of other forms
of prior learning are evaluated for equivalence against the learning
outcomes of particular module(s) at the lower levels of a qualification
for advanced standing/exemption.

Important: In both instances, students requesting RPL are to complete
the RPL Application Form, and provide verifiable and/or certified
evidence that prior learning is equivalent to the learning outcomes of a
module of study or the minimum entry requirements of a programme. This
is submitted together with their application fee and Portfolio of
Evidence to the Admissions Department prior to the start of their
studies. All applications for RPL will be reviewed by the Registrar's
Office. RPL application outcomes are communicated to the applicant in
writing by the Admissions Department. In line with Council on Higher
Education (CHE) and Higher Education Qualifications Sub-Framework
(HEQSF) regulations, SACAP's RPL process involves a fair and equitable
assessment of the applicant's prior knowledge and skill in the field for
which RPL is being sought. Depending on the evidence provided and the
comprehensiveness of the portfolio submitted, the applicant may be asked
to attend a personal, skype or telephonic interview. During an
interview, the applicant may be required to demonstrate an appropriate
level of competency in both the theory and the practice of the
module(s)/programme for which RPL is being sought. The assessment of
appropriate level competency is guided by the NQF level descriptors and
measured by SACAP's Competency Based Framework. For modules involving
practical components including (but not limited to) Social Work,
competencies of counselling and communication competencies, an applicant
may be required to submit a videorecorded role-play demonstration or
practical assessment as a demonstration of his or her competencies,
and/or attend an interview with a RPL Assessor. All submissions need to
adhere to SACAP's Language Policy. An RPL for admission into a
qualification can detail all relevant information in which formal,
informal, and non-formal learning occurred and can include the
following: 

RPL applicant has learnt from their life/work experiences and how this
experience equates to the minimum entrance requirements of the
qualification for which they are applying for RPL.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 15



A resume of the applicant's educational, employment, personal and
professional development, and community-based and/or organisational work
experiences.



Certified copies of relevant school, university or college transcripts,
certificates or other relevant documents, job descriptions, and/or
letters from employers demonstrating prior learning and current
competencies.

Postgraduate qualifications may include additional requirements for
admission into the programme based on RPL. Please see below the
programme specific sections for more information.

Programme-Specific Rules for CAT and RPL Please note: Some programmes
only have one student intake per year, and as such modules in these
programmes are only offered once a year in accordance with the
prescribed study plan. Students who have been granted CAT or RPL for
module exemption for any applicable modules that they have completed
previously as part of another qualification (whether that qualification
was completed or not), will be required to follow their prescribed study
plans and take modules as and when they are timetabled. This could
result in some terms where the student will have a heavier or a lighter
workload.

Postgraduate Diploma in Coaching: As the Postgraduate Diploma in
Coaching is an exit level qualification, CAT and RPL for advanced
standing or exemption will not be granted for any modules within this
programme (see exception clause above). RPL will only be considered for
admission for applicants 24 years of age and older without the minimum
entrance requirements where a portfolio of evidence is provided
demonstrating formal, informal, and non-formal knowledge, training, work
experience, and/or learning in a cognate field of study equivalent to an
NQF level 7 qualification to support admission into the programme on the
basis of Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). For the PGDC, the RPL
portfolio of evidence must include: 

Evidence that prior learning is equivalent to a minimum of an NQF Level
7 qualification;



Evidence of training in cognate short learning programmes, courses,
micro-credentials;



Relevant work/life experience; and/or



A motivational letter for admission to the programme.

Consistent with the general principles of this policy, SACAP reserves
the right to accept a student into the coaching programme where
qualifications and or extensive experience relevant to the coaching
qualification is evident, including completion of short learning
programmes (SLP) in the coaching field of study.

Bachelor of Psychology: The general rules of CAT and RPL apply for this
programme along with the following additional condition. Students are
required to register as Student Registered Counsellors at the outset of
this professional programme and are required to complete it in its
entirety, as such, students studying the Bachelor of Psychology (BPsych)
who have been granted CAT for any applicable modules that they have
completed previously as part of another qualification (whether that
qualification was completed or \* Please Note: At any point in time the
latest policy will apply in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 16

not), are not permitted to move ahead of their BPsych cohort, and are
required to follow the study plan as prescribed. Students who have been
granted CAT will not be required to take those modules that have already
been credited but must, however, wait until the rest of their cohort
completes these modules as well. As such, students who have been granted
CAT may not take on additional modules that are scheduled further on in
the programme as they are not permitted to advance ahead of their cohort
or to shorten the programme's expected and planned duration.

Bachelor of Social Work: The general rules of CAT and RPL apply for this
programme along with the following additional condition. Students
studying the Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) who have been granted CAT for
any applicable modules that they have completed previously as part of
another qualification (whether that qualification was completed or not),
are not permitted to move ahead of their BSW cohort, and are required to
follow the study plan as prescribed. Students who have been granted CAT
will not be required to take those modules that have already been
credited but must, however, wait until the rest of their cohort
completes these modules as well. As such, students who have been granted
CAT may not take on additional modules that are scheduled further on in
the programme as they are not permitted to advance ahead of their cohort
or to shorten the programme's expected and planned duration.

Master of Social Science in Community Mental Health Promotion: As the
Master of Social Science degree is an exit level qualification, CAT and
RPL for advanced standing or exemption will not be granted for any
modules within the Master of Social Science in Community Mental Health
Promotion (MSocSci) qualification (see exception clause above). RPL will
only be considered for admission in to the MSocSci degree for those
applicants without the minimum entrance requirements (i.e. a relevant
Honours bachelor's degree or postgraduate diploma in a cognate
discipline) who have shown either by examination, research experience,
publication, considerable relevant work experience in the field, or a
record of appropriate training and/or development, that they have
reached a level in the subject or a cognate subject, that is equivalent
to the learning outcomes of an Honours bachelor's degree/NQF 8
qualification. These claims must be supported by a relevant portfolio of
evidence that can be verified, which could include, but is not limited
to, a combination of the following: study transcripts (compared,
certified and verified by SAQA for international qualifications), course
descriptors, a detailed curriculum vita, work and/or academic
references, previous research paper(s), publication(s). RPL process to
be followed: 

The applicant's RPL portfolio of evidence will be assessed by one or
more internal senior academic staff members to ascertain the applicant's
level of competence for admission into the MSocSci degree.



Where the applicant's RPL portfolio of evidence is found lacking, the
applicant could be required to do a piece of research in an area in
which they have relevant experience and prior learning in order to
substantiate their portfolio of evidence.



Those applicants who do not qualify for RPL because their prior learning
and research experience is not sufficient to meet the requirements of
the SAQA NQF 8 exit-level outcomes, will be advised to complete the
required prerequisite qualification(s) before attempting to apply for
this MSocSci degree.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 17

Process to be followed for both CAT and RPL Students requesting CAT or
RPL are to complete the CAT/RPL Application Form and submit it together
with their application fee and Portfolio of Evidence to the Admissions
Department prior to the start of their studies. The Portfolio of
Evidence may differ per application, but in general includes the
following: 

CAT requires an appropriate university transcript(s) no older than 5
years with relevant module description information (i.e. content, credit
value, NQF level).



For the successful exemption (RPL) or credit (CAT) of a module, evidence
is required to show that the equivalent learning outcomes have already
been met for the relevant module.



An RPL for admission into a qualification can detail all relevant
information in which formal, informal, and non-formal learning occurred
and can include the following: o

RPL applicant has learnt from their life/work experiences and how this
experience equates to the minimum entrance requirements of the
qualification for which they are applying for RPL.

o

A resume of the applicant's educational, employment, personal and
professional development, and community-based and/or organisational work
experiences.

o

Certified copies of relevant university or college transcripts,
certificates or other relevant documents, job descriptions, and/or
letters from employers demonstrating prior learning and current
competencies.



In the instance where English Proficiency does not meet the minimum
entrance requirements, the student will be required to submit a written
component with the application to demonstrate their English
comprehension.



Fees will differ depending on whether it is a CAT or RPL application.



All applications will be reviewed by either the Registrar's Office.
Depending on the evidence provided and the comprehensiveness of the
portfolio submitted, the applicant may be asked to attend a personal,
Skype or telephonic interview.



During an interview, the applicant may be required to demonstrate an
appropriate level of competency in both the theory and the practice of
the module(s)/programme for which RPL is being sought.



The outcome will be communicated to the applicant by the Admissions
Department thereafter.

Notification and Appeals Procedure for CAT or RPL 

The application process and assessment can take up to 4 weeks to
complete.



The credit/exemption/admission will either be granted or not granted.
The applicant will be notified by email of the outcome.



Applications deemed successful will be charged a fee per module
successfully credited/exempted. Such fees apply to external applicants
and not to SACAP graduates.

If the application is unsuccessful, then the applicant has fourteen (14)
days from the day of notification of the outcome to appeal this
decision. The formal procedure must be followed as outlined in the
Student Complaints, Grievances and Appeals Policy.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 18

Flexible Delivery The College recognises the principles of flexible
delivery. Programmes are designed to emphasise flexibility of delivery
in order to maximise student opportunities to access and participate in
learning. SACAP's flexible delivery offers the following: 

Full-time (3-4 modules per term).



Part--time (1-2 modules per term)



Face-to-face (Contact) mode of delivery



Online (Distance) mode of delivery (as applicable)

In the instance that a student achieves a grade point average (GPA) of
75% and above in all modules taken over at least two consecutive terms,
they may request to increase their study load to four modules
specifically for those programmes where it is not already a requirement.
If a student would like to increase their workload, a formal request
must be made to the Head of Student Services. Furthermore, in the case
where a student struggles academically with their given study workload,
the Student Services Department will be tasked to review the situation
and it may be recommended that the student reduce the number of modules
undertaken during a given term. Academic counselling may also be
recommended in order to help them improve their academic performance.
The final decision on study workload rests with the student in
consultation with the Head of Student Services. It should be noted that
students may not register for more than three academic modules whilst
completing the Work Integrated Learning (WIL) preparatory workshops (WIL
Part 1). On the successful completion of WIL Part 1, students may then
proceed into WIL placement (WIL Part 2) provided they are registered for
no more than two additional academic modules.

Annual Registration A student is required to register for their
programme of study annually. In between the annual registration,
students are required to complete the re-enrolment process to confirm
the modules they are to study for that particular term. Should a student
be inactive in their studies for more than one academic year (three
consecutive terms), the College will automatically de-enroll the student
from their programme. In the event the student wishes to return, the
student will need to go through the admissions process as a new student.
SACAP reserves the right to judge each application for extension of
study based on merit. Registration is only official once the
non-refundable registration fee has been paid and the student's payment
plan has been confirmed with the relevant documentation. See the finance
policy for more information on payment methods. 

Study fees include electronic study materials.



Prescribed textbooks are not included in the fees and must be purchased
separately.



After the close of registration and prior to the commencement of class,
an administration fee will be charged for any changes made to
module/class/programme/campus.

Class Timetabling and Class Allocation A provisional class timetable is
made available prior to the start of each term. 

The class timetable is subject to change without prior notice.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 19



SACAP reserves the right not to run a module should the given module not
have enough registered students to make it viable.



Early student registration is encouraged to secure a student's place in
a class.



SACAP cannot guarantee that a student's preferred time slot will be
available.



Students are not able to choose a specific educator for any given
module. It is not possible to match modules with specific educators as
the educator could change at any time prior to the commencement of the
module.



A given class will not exceed 25 students.



Students are not permitted to move between classes/change classes
without consulting the Student Administrator.



No class changes will be made after the first week of term.

Transfer of a Qualification A transfer of qualification refers to a
current student who wishes to transfer to another qualification other
than the qualification originally registered for. The College may
consider such requests for a change of qualification if: 

All entrance requirements and programme rules for the new qualification
have been satisfied;



There is a place available in the particular programme.

Should a student request to transfer to a new qualification, a completed
Application to Transfer Qualification form is to be submitted to Student
Administration. The application should include any supporting
documentation that indicates that the Minimum Entry Requirements for the
new qualification have been fulfilled. Where applicable, credits that
have been accumulated in the previous qualification may be transferred
to the new qualification, i.e. a credit transfer. In such instances, a
Credit Accumulation and Transfer Application must be completed and
submitted to Student Administration (See Credit Accumulation and
Transfer and Recognition of Prior Learning Policy). Successful transfers
will only be implemented for the next term the student is active.
Students will automatically be de-registered from the old qualification.
An incomplete transcript will be issued to students listing those
modules completed in the incomplete qualification. Please note: 

SACAP does not automatically guarantee the transfer of a qualification.



The principles in both SACAP's Admissions Policy and Credit Accumulation
and Transfer and Recognition of Prior Learning Policy apply.

Religious Considerations SACAP encourages diversity as part of its
educational philosophy. Holding true to the integrity of these values
require acknowledging diversity in all its various forms that includes
religious beliefs. Any request for absence from College activities due
to religious considerations should be discussed with Student Services
prior to the start of term. \* Please Note: At any point in time the
latest policy will apply in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 20

Finance Policy This policy aims to guide students with regard to the
financial and administrative aspects of their SACAP experience.

Payment plans As detailed on the SACAP Fee Structure document, the
following three payment plans are available for Tuition Fees: a. Annual
Upfront Payment: Fees are paid upfront for the year and are due two
weeks before the commencement of term. A 5% discount is already factored
into the amounts reflected on our Fee Structure, but this discount will
only be credited to the student's account if full payment is received
two weeks before term commences. If payment is delayed then the full
termly fees will be payable. b. Termly Upfront Payment: Fees are paid
upfront for the term and are due two weeks before the commencement of
term. c. Monthly Debit Order Payment: A monthly debit order amount (as
detailed on the Fee Structure or Pro Forma Invoice) will be drawn
against the fee payer's account. The completed debit order form must be
signed by the nominated fee payer and submitted to the Admissions
department before the commencement of term. We regret that no other
monthly payment plans are available (e.g. monthly EFT payments or 'stop
orders'). Please take note of the following additional conditions that
apply to debit orders: o

The debit order form is for a variable amount, and the amount actually
debited against the fee payer's account will change to accommodate our
standard annual fee increases and any other deviation from your initial
study plan.

o

SACAP is not required to obtain consent to vary the debit order amount
in accordance with a student's study plan.

o

We regret that the Debit Order Payment plan is not available to
International Students.

Payment Reference Numbers: Please ensure that only the relevant student
number is used as a reference on any payments made via EFT or direct
bank deposit. This is essential for us to correctly identify and
allocate payments onto the correct student account. Please do not use
names, ID number or telephone number as your reference. Proof of payment
should please be sent to studentaccounts@sacap.edu.za to further assist
with allocation.

Application Fee An application fee is charged on application and is
non-refundable whether the application is successful or unsuccessful.

Annual Registration Fee An annual registration fee is charged in each
year of study for which a student is registered, until a student has
completed their qualification. Registration fees are payable strictly
upfront regardless of the payment plan selected, and so are now shown
separately from Tuition Fees on our Fee Structure. \* Please Note: At
any point in time the latest policy will apply in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 21

Registration fees are refundable up until 2 weeks prior to commencement
of the student's next academic year, after which they become strictly
non-refundable.

Withdrawal/Deferral/Extension of Study Once the academic term has
started, any withdrawal/deferral/extension of studies will still result
in a proportionate charge for the term's fees as follows: 

During Week 1 -- 25%



During Week 2 -- 50%



During Week 3 -- 75%



After Week 4 -- 100%

Intensive modules are by their nature short modules that do not stretch
over a full academic term. Once an intensive module has commenced, a
student will be charged in full for the module with no reduction for
withdrawal, etc. Please refer to the Student Handbook for more detailed
information regarding the administration of
withdrawals/deferrals/extension of studies.

Student Accounts 

Proforma invoices (quotations) are provided to students on a request
basis prior to the commencement of each academic year, and they are
based on a student's study plan at the time of issue. Should a student
amend their study plan during the course of the year this may result in
changes to their fees. Students are therefore advised to liaise with the
Student Accounts department in advance of making any changes to
understand any financial implications.



All students are invoiced on a termly basis for the modules they are
actually taking in any particular term. It will thus take three terms to
be fully billed for a full academic year of study. A student's account
may therefore go to zero or into credit during the course of the year
between the termly billings.



Statements are sent out on a monthly basis to students with a balance
owing on their account (debit balance). Statements are available on
request to students who do not have a balance outstanding (zero or
credit balance).



Only Registration Fees and Tuition Fees will be invoiced against a
student's account. Other sundry fees and charges are not invoiced
against a student's account because they are charged strictly upfront on
application or at point-of-sale and are non-refundable.

Non-payment of Fees and Temporary Restriction of Access a. Debit Order
Payment plan: 

Should a student's debit order be returned as unpaid, the student will
be sent an automatic notification providing 12 working days to settle
the unpaid debit order by EFT or otherwise.



Should the unpaid debit order not be settled within the 12-day grace
period, the student's MySACAP account access will be temporarily
restricted until settlement is made. During this time the student will
have no access to MySACAP and will not be able to access resources from
MySACAP, submit assignments, or complete exams or open book tests until
settlement is made.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 22



Should the unpaid debit order not be settled and a second month's debit
order is returned as unpaid, the student's entire term's fees become due
and payable, and the student may be handed over for debt collection.



The student may also no longer be permitted to pay by debit order going
forward and will instead be required to pay the fees in full upfront for
the term.

b.  Termly Payment plan 

Should a student not be on the Debit Order Payment plan, the student's
fees for each term are payable upfront in full prior to the commencement
of the term. Should these fees not have been paid, the student will be
sent an automatic notification providing 12 working days to settle the
fees due.



In the event that the full term's fees have not been settled within the
12-day grace period, the student's MySACAP account access will be
temporarily restricted until settlement is made. During this time the
student will have no access to MySACAP and will not be able to access
resources from MySACAP, submit assignments, or complete exams or open
book tests until settlement is made.



Should the full term's fees not be paid after 40 workings days the
student may be handed over for debt collection.

c.  General 

On settlement, a proof of payment should be sent to
studentaccounts@sacap.edu.za to expedite the lifting of the MySACAP
restriction.



If, two weeks prior to the commencement of the following term, a
student's account has an outstanding balance, for any reason, the
student will be removed from their classes for the term about to
commence and will not be permitted to re-enroll, re-register or return
to studies until the balance is settled in full (subject to class
availability).



Should a new module commence when a student is in the 12-day grace
period, the student will not be permitted to commence the module until
the outstanding balance has been settled.

Student Bursary Policy SACAP aims to self-fund a proportion of its fee
income annually to support existing students who, due to exceptional
circumstances, would not otherwise be able to continue their studies.
The funds available for bursary assistance is unfortunately limited.
SACAP receives no public funding and so bursaries are not guaranteed.
All new applicants who apply for a SACAP Bursary need to complete a
SACAP Bursary Application Form (Addendum A) and submit supporting
financial documents (outlined in Addendum A) along with their academic
registration documentation to their campus Student Support and

Bursary Student Extension of Study Period SACAP's Extension Policy
applies in the event that a student is unable to continue with their
academic studies for a specific duration for valid reasons. In such
cases, the bursary will be put on hold for the duration of the study
break and will be re-evaluated on the student's return to SACAP to
continue with the same programme.

SECTION 2:

STUDENT MATTERS

SACAP Student Graduate Attributes The term 'graduate attributes' refers
to a range of skills beyond those that are discipline specific, and are
the qualities, skills and understandings a higher education community
agrees its students should develop during their time with the
institution. Graduate attributes speak to the need for holistically
developing traits and competencies throughout the student journey, by
creating opportunities for learning in their curricular and
co-curricular activities and in society at large. With this in mind,
SACAP's five graduate attributes represent both SACAP's values, vision
and mission, as well as the needs and desires of employers and industry
stakeholders. There is a clear call for graduates who are socially
responsible and active citizens in an increasingly interconnected,
fastpaced, and often troubled world. Therefore, SACAP is committed to
creating an environment and opportunities alongside our students in
which these attributes can be holistically developed in each and every
graduate. Each of SACAP's graduates are unique, having come from diverse
backgrounds and experiences. The length, depth, breadth and quality of
their engagement with and experiences while at SACAP will develop unique
attributes that will set them apart: 1. SACAP graduates are creative and
critical-thinkers with an entrepreneurial spirit: they are able to
systematically engage real world problems and formulate innovative and
sustainable solutions. 2. SACAP graduates are empathetic and self-aware:
they are reflective, flexible and skilled communicators. They conduct
themselves with maturity and professionalism, and have the potential to
be leaders in their respective fields. 3. SACAP graduates are values
driven and act with integrity: the application of their knowledge and
skills is always in the pursuit of creating a better world. They are
ethical decision-makers and take responsibility for their actions. 4.
SACAP graduates are socially conscious global citizens: they are
sensitive to both local and global issues and recognise the central role
communities play in affecting change. They understand the value of
diversity and can work effectively in various contexts. 5. SACAP
graduates are at home in an ever-changing world: they are prepared for
living and working in a digital society and are willing to learn,
unlearn and relearn in commitment to professional development and
lifelong learning.

Student Responsibilities 

Students are expected to participate actively and positively in the
teaching-learning environment.



Students are encouraged to maintain steady progress within the module,
comply with the workload expectations, and submit required work on time.



Honesty is required from students in all of their dealings with the
College. Cheating, plagiarism (including allowing another student to
copy work for an assessment), and damaging or defacing books or other
library materials may be dealt with as an offence incurring disciplinary
action.



Students are responsible for monitoring their own progress within the
teaching and learning environment and the academic programme. This
includes ensuring that assessments are

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 26

completed timeously. Bear in mind that time management is critical.
Students are encouraged to contact academic staff for assistance if they
have concerns about particular aspects of their learning and/or
progress, and are strongly encouraged to make use of the student support
services available or other professional services as the need arises. 

Students are invited to provide regular feedback on the teaching and
learning environment. Student participation is important as students
represent a key constituency within the College and provide a useful
perspective on its operations. Accordingly, when they accept appointment
to committees of the College, they do so to the best of their abilities,
aware of the responsibilities attendant on such appointment.



Students are expected to act at all times in a way that demonstrates
respect for the rights and privileges of other members of the College
community, both fellow students, educators, and staff, and show
commitment to the ideals of the College with special reference to
excellence in performance and freedom of expression.

Students studying on any face-to-face (contact) campus should be aware
of the following: 

Class Attendance: Students are expected to attend classes and to
communicate with the educator or Student Administrator should other
conditions affect or impede attendance.



No more than two classes per module may be missed, this includes any
makeup classes that the student may be required to attend.



Smoking is not permitted anywhere in the building, including electronic
cigarettes.



Students are required to be punctual for each class.



Cell phones are to be switched off during all classes.



No eating or drinking (except for bottled water) is permitted in the
classrooms.

Student Representative Council (SRC) The SRC represents all students at
SACAP, and their overall interest and social well-being, in various
committees for example to the Academic Board. It is highly involved in
co-operative decision-making on campus. The students elect the SRC
annually. The duties, functions, privileges and term of office are set
out in the SRC Constitution and election bylaws approved by the Council
as institutional rules. SACAP considers the SRC to be a very important
stakeholder, as the student voice at SACAP is highly valued.

The Role of a Student Representative 

The role and function of a Student Representative is to liaise with the
student body to accurately and objectively represent students'
suggestions, ideas, information, and concerns to the SRC, and to carry
out the unique responsibilities associated with their position on the
committee as described in the constitution of the SRC.



Students may nominate any student currently enrolled at the College. A
student may selfnominate should they possess the interest and commitment
to represent the student body. A Student Representative is invited onto
the Student Representative Council based on the student's availability
and the number of nominations received. The primary task of a Student
Representative is to represent the views, opinions and concerns of the
student body and to facilitate the implementation of SRC initiatives.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

Health and Wellness Policy The South African College of Applied
Psychology (SACAP) aims to provide a secure and supportive environment
for both work and learning and teaching in which staff and students are
supported and encouraged to reach a high level of professional and/or
academic achievement. The overall health and wellbeing of SACAP staff
and students is of paramount importance to the functioning of SACAP as a
private higher education institution. SACAP is fully committed to its
obligation towards its staff and students, and prioritises health and
wellness through establishing policies and programmes that promote
health and wellness for all.

Wellness Management Wellness management is a holistic approach to human
wellness and promotes both individual and organisational wellness.
Wellness management at SACAP includes: ●

Emotional needs: To promote emotional intelligence, self-awareness,
self-esteem, optimism, sense of coherence and resilience of students and
employees, e.g. fear management skills, stress management, trauma
counselling, critical incident management, etc.

●

Social needs: To promote the ability of students and employees to
interact successfully and to be able to balance and to live up to the
expectations and demands of personal roles. This includes learning good
communication skills, creating support networks with colleagues, peers,
friends and family, embracing diversity and showing respect for others
and self.

●

Intellectual needs: To promote the ability to make sound decisions, to
think critically, to be open to new ideas, to master new skills, to be
creative and curious. e.g. role clarity, participation in decision
making surrounding their immediate, work integrated learning,
collaborative projects, and through growth and development
opportunities, etc.

Student Wellness: Student Support and Development Department (SSD) SACAP
believes in the importance of providing integrated and holistic support
and development services to enhance student wellness. SACAP, therefore,
provides a number of support programmes, initiatives, and personnel for
students studying at SACAP. Students have access to the Student Support
and Development Department to discuss relevant study challenges and
potential academic or psycho-social challenges that may impact their
studies. \* Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will
apply in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 28

In order to benefit from this service, SACAP students are encouraged to
approach the Department directly. Reasonable Accommodation means
concessionary consideration is given to ensuring the specific support
needs of students who are experiencing psychosocial challenges.
Reasonable accommodation support will be considered once students have
provided relevant supporting documentation. This is determined on a
case-by-case basis by the designated Student Support and Development
(SSD) advisor or relevant Programme Coordinator on each campus.

Consideration for Disabilities Please refer to SACAP's Students with
Disabilities and Learning Differences Policy for further information in
this regard.

Managing Substance/Alcohol Abuse/Dependence SACAP recognises substance
dependency as a treatable and manageable condition. 

Staff and students are responsible for promptly seeking advice and
appropriate treatment, should they suspect that they may have an alcohol
or substance dependency problem.



SACAP maintains an open-door policy with respect to substance use and/or
dependence. There is a responsibility on the part of staff and students
to approach SACAP and inform them of their difficulties with substances.



Please refer to SACAP's Code of Conduct and Disciplinary policy for more
information on SACAP's standards and responsibility with regards to
alcohol/substance use and abuse and the process for those who experience
a relapse.



SACAP will endeavour to assist as far as reasonably possible and provide
the staff member or student with the necessary time off from their work
or studies in order to seek treatment for the substance abuse/dependence
problem.



Should a staff member or student fail to disclose their alcohol or
substance dependency problem, this may lead to a possible suspension or
termination of their employment or studies.

Managing Psychosocial Wellbeing 

SACAP encourages its staff and students to take care of themselves.



SACAP maintains an open-door policy with respect to psychosocial
support.



There is a responsibility on the part of staff and students to approach
and inform SACAP in the event they are experiencing psychosocial
difficulties that are negatively impacting their work or studies.



SACAP will endeavour to assist as far as reasonably possible and provide
the staff member or student with the necessary time off from their work
or studies in order to seek the necessary support.

SACAP Staff and Students' Rights and Responsibilities With respect to
staff and student wellness, SACAP has the responsibility of ensuring
that: 

Both the work and learning and teaching environment at SACAP is
conducive for optimum

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 29

productivity and functioning. 

The basic wellness services are made accessible to all staff and
students, and are conducted in an ethical manner.



Staff and students' rights to confidentiality, autonomy, sensitivity,
timeous intervention, equity, transparency, and confidentiality are
protected.



Staff and students are informed of conditions at SACAP which may be
harmful to their health and wellness.

Staff and students have the responsibility to: 

Conduct their work and studies in a manner that advances and protects
their own health and wellness.



Report and/or take action to correct conditions in the learning and
teaching environment that may be harmful to their own health and
wellness, as well as those of their peers.



Take initiative to seek professional intervention or support as and when
necessary.



Inform the College of any psychosocial challenges hindering their work
or academic responsibilities.

Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) SACAP has appointed Health and
Safety Officers on each of its campuses and ensures that designated
staff have the required first aid training. SACAP also conducts an
annual Occupational Health and Safety audit on each of its campuses to
ensure OHS compliance. The purpose of these practices includes, but is
not limited to: 

Occupational safety: Protection of SACAP staff and students and the
SACAP employees from occupational injury, diseases, stressors, and
hazards through proactive measures of risk reduction.



Occupational hygiene: Involves the recognition, evaluation, and control
of physical, psychological, and biological factors at SACAP which may
affect the wellness of students and employees.



Environmental management: Refers to environmental conservation such as
waste management, environmental impact assessment use, and control of
hazardous materials.



Disaster management: Preventing, planning for, and managing disasters
through disaster preparedness, rapid response, recovery and
rehabilitation, so as to minimise loss of life, injury, and damage to
property, i.e. first aid training, emergency and fire evacuation
protocols, fire extinguishers, etc.

Confidentiality Confidential information generally pertains to private
personal information and may include a student's financial, academic,
criminal record, or health status, but not to the exclusion of other
types of information. Section 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of
South Africa, 1996 guarantees every person's right to privacy. This,
therefore, means that a staff member or student's confidential
information may not be disclosed to a requesting party, unless written
consent has been provided by the student to disclose information.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 30

This right, however, may be limited by legislation (e.g. section 16 of
the Labour Relations Act, No. 66 of 1995 and the Promotion of Access to
Information Act, 2000) and/or court orders that warrant the disclosure
of information. The collection and maintenance of confidential
information should be kept securely and only those entitled to
officially engage therewith may be allowed controlled access. The
Protection of Personal Information Act recognises that the right to
privacy includes the right to protection against the unlawful
collection, retention, dissemination and use of personal information. In
line with international standards, the processing of personal
information by public and private bodies must be done in a manner that
gives effect to the right to privacy, subject to justifiable limitations
aimed at protecting other rights and important interests. Refer to
SACAP's Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Policies for further
information in this regard. A SACAP staff member or student will be
afforded an opportunity to verify the accuracy, to rectify, and to
update any of their confidential information.

Students with a Disability and/or Learning Differences Policy SACAP is
committed to supporting a culture that values the promotion of
inclusion. Inclusion is regarded as a universal human right and aims at
embracing the diversity of all people. SACAP is committed to equitable
access and participation for all. SACAP endeavours to provide an
"inclusive and safe environment for all, one that eliminates
discrimination and intolerance and that reflects our SACAP values as
well as the principles of understanding, acceptance and justice
irrespective of race, gender, disability or any other differences"
(Department of Higher Education and Training, 2018, p. 20). Aligned to
South Africa's White Paper on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
(Dlamini, 2016) and the National Plan for Higher Education of 2001,
SACAP is committed to creating a caring and inclusive teaching and
learning environment. One in which students with disabilities and/or
learning differences are integrated into the learning experience in a
way that allows for their full participation in their academic
qualification. To create such an environment SACAP is committed to
protecting and providing an equal and optimal opportunity for the
personal growth and transformation of all of its students. To this end,
SACAP will endeavour to ensure equal access and participation for all
students and will treat both students with disabilities and/or learning
differences and students who are nondisabled in a way that allows them
to maintain their dignity and develop to their full potential. SACAP
embraces the principle of mainstreaming and inclusion of people with
disabilities and/or learning differences.

Definitions of Terms The following definitions are aligned to and
informed by South Africa's White Paper on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (Dlamini, 2016, pp. 3-15). 

Disability: SACAP recognises students with disabilities as students who
have "long-term physical, mental, intellectual, neurological,
psychological or sensory impairments which, in interaction with various
barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society
on an equal basis with others" (Dlamini, 2016, p. 4). These challenges,
however, are really only experienced as "disability" when these
individuals are denied access to full participation in all aspects of
life, and when society fails to uphold the rights and specific needs of
individuals with a disability.



Learning Differences: Learning differences refer to mental,
intellectual, neurological, psychological or sensory differences which
manifest predominantly in the way students with learning differences
learn. Learning differences may create a variety of barriers to academic
success if concessions, dispensations and allowances are not put in
place. Learning

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 31

differences may not necessarily be indicative of a diagnosable learning
disability and may be more broadly categorised as a learning difficulty.


Students with disabilities and/or learning differences: While disability
is a protected characteristic in law, allowing for SACAP to treat
students with disability more favourably than their peers who are
non-disabled, albeit, not to the detriment or disadvantage of
nondisabled students SACAP endorses the use of the terminology
'Disability and/or Learning Difference' to ensure that the focus is not
on a student's weaknesses but rather on a student's differences that may
also require concessionary consideration.



Reasonable Accommodation: Reasonable accommodation means concessionary
consideration is given to ensuring the specific support needs of
learners with disabilities and/or learning differences are provided for
so that they are able to equitably participate in learning alongside
their peers. Reasonable accommodation refers to necessary and
appropriate modification and adjustments to the teaching and learning
environment that do not impose a disproportionate or undue burden on the
staffing and infrastructure that supports the teaching and learning
environment. What is reasonable is determined on a case-by-case basis by
the designated Student Support and Development (SSD) advisor on each
campus (who holds responsibilities in terms of disability support
services), the Head of Student Support and Development (HOSSD), the
relevant Head of Teaching and Learning (HOTL) and the Head of Campus
(HOC) who weigh up a number of considerations against the right to
equitable education without discrimination. This will be finalised by
SACAP's Disability Task Team.

Policy Statement 

SACAP seeks to foster and support a diverse student population and to
integrate equal opportunity for students with disabilities and/or
learning differences into its policies, procedures, decisions and
operations. SACAP, therefore, seeks to minimize the lived experience of
"Disability Discrimination" (Dlamini, 2016). SACAP stands against
"Disablism" and negative attitudes, behaviours and practices which
discriminate (intentionally or unintentionally) against students with
disabilities and/or learning differences as these may impact on the
equal participation of all students.



In accordance with SACAP's Code of Conduct, SACAP will not tolerate such
attitudes, behaviours and practices and should these be experienced by
students with disabilities and/or learning differences the student
should alert the designated Student Support and Development (SSD)
advisor on each campus who holds responsibilities in terms of disability
support services. The SSD advisor will assist the student in initiating
complaints and grievance processes.



SACAP is committed to equal treatment of students with disabilities
and/or learning differences and students who are non-disabled. Where
necessary and appropriate, students with disabilities and/or learning
differences will receive additional support so that they will not be at
any substantial disadvantage compared to students who are non-disabled.



SACAP will endeavour to make use of universal access learning design
principles in its teaching and learning environment. Universal access
learning design facilitates the whole learning cycle including the
development of flexible classroom materials, using various technology
tools, and varying the delivery of information or instruction for all
students as well as including aspects such as an understanding of the
learning content, campus experiences that leads to the full development
of the student, and integration of students within the broader student
population. Students must be evaluated on their abilities not their
disabilities and, where practical and reasonable, methods of teaching
and assessment may be modified to take account of the differences
experienced by students with disabilities

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 32

and/or learning differences. Teaching methodologies, processes and
assessments will be fair, equitable and accessible to students with
different types of disabilities and/or learning differences as far as
reasonably possible. 

SACAP staff must ensure implementation and compliance with appropriate
academic adjustments, classroom accommodation, the integration of
auxiliary aids, and empowerment of educators in the management of
students with disabilities and/or learning differences on the campus.



In order to strengthen the representative voice of students with
disabilities, the SSD Department, together with the Disability Task Team
will actively encourage a representation of students with disabilities
on its Student Representative Council.

Disability and/or learning difference disclosure In the interest of
non-discrimination against students with disabilities and/or learning
differences, the following policy guides SACAP's disclosure processes: 

In order to best support applicants with disabilities and/or learning
differences, SACAP encourages early disclosure during the initial
application process.



It is the responsibility of any new SACAP student to inform the relevant
admissions officer, as part of the application process, of their
disability and/or learning differences.



It is the responsibility of any registered SACAP students, who have
received medical evidence of a disability and/or learning difference
during the course of their studies, to inform their campus SSD
Department as soon as possible.



Students who have adhered to the early voluntary disability disclosure
and support process will have their application assessed by the relevant
Disability Task Team and campus teams.



The disability disclosure and support process assists in a realistic
assessment of SACAP's institutional ability to mainstream the student
within the SACAP environment and provide the necessary and appropriate
support to the student throughout their years of study.



SACAP may request an individual interview with the candidate to talk
through their individual disability and/or learning difference and the
support needs they have;



SACAP will request a report from the relevant medical practitioner for
guidance regarding the concessions students with disabilities and/or
learning differences may require. This will also guide SACAP's
assessment.



While SACAP embraces the principle of mainstreaming and inclusion of
students with disabilities and/or learning differences, there may be
cases where SACAP's capacity to provide the necessary support to ensure
equal access and participation for the student is inadequate. In such a
case a member of the SSD Department or Disability Task Team will follow
up with the applicant to discuss SACAP's challenges and concerns in
accepting the candidate into one of its qualifications. This discussion
will be managed on the principles of dignity and respect.



It is incumbent on SACAP to ensure that candidates who have adhered to
the disability disclosure and support process undergo modified selection
and recruitment processes, where appropriate, to ensure that such
candidates can be considered equally with students who are non-disabled.



Once enrolled into one of SACAP's qualifications, SACAP's SSD
Department, in consultation with the Disability Task Team manages the
database of students with disabilities and/or

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 33

learning differences, who have indicated that they need
support/accommodations, to ensure retention and throughput of such
students. 

SACAP will protect the confidentiality of information that has been
disclosed. This information will be released to appropriate stakeholders
(including other students, where applicable) only with the consent of
the student.



In the case of non-disclosure by students with disabilities and/or
learning differences, or where the disability is not self-evident or
self-reported, it will be more difficult for SACAP to comply with the
provisions of this policy. In such cases, students with disabilities
and/or learning differences who do not disclose their status may be
negatively impacted by an institutional lack of understanding as well as
disadvantage themselves in being able to access support services and
academic accommodations. This may ultimately negatively impact on the
student's academic progress. In these cases, where students have not
followed the disability disclosure and support process SACAP cannot be
held liable for a lack of support, retention and throughput of such
students.



Services and support are key to the success of all students. Where
students with disabilities and/or learning differences have complied
with the disability disclosure and support process a consultative
approach will be initiated between the designated SSD advisor on each
campus (who holds responsibilities in terms of disability support
services), and the student.

Reasonable Accommodations and Concessions: Reasonable accommodation
and/or concessions may be made to ensure that students with disabilities
and/or learning differences have access to, participate and advance in
academia on an equal basis with others. Reasonable accommodation refers
to necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments to the
teaching and learning environment that do not impose a disproportionate
or undue burden on the staffing and infrastructure that supports the
teaching and learning environment. What is reasonable is determined on a
case-by-case basis by the designated SSD advisor on each campus (who
holds responsibilities in terms of disability support services), the
Head of SSD, the relevant Head of Teaching and Learning (HOTL) and Head
of Campus (HOC) who weigh up a number of considerations against the
right to equitable education without discrimination. SACAP considers the
following provisions "reasonable": Students with disabilities and/or
learning differences may be granted permission to use assistive
technology, devices, specialised equipment and teaching and learning
support materials in their studies. 

An educational assistive device is any device that is designed, made or
adapted to assist a student in performing a particular educational task.
It is intended to enhance or improve the functional capabilities of
students with disabilities.



Assistive technology and devices are any technology, device, product,
equipment or tool that is designed or adapted to enable persons with
disabilities and/or learning differences to participate in activities,
tasks or actions. They may include:



Mobility aids such as wheelchairs, prostheses and crutches;



Communication aids such as hearing aids, FM systems;



Sensory aids such as white canes; noise-reducing headphones and coloured
lenses;



Technology aids such as computers, screen readers, magnifiers, text to
audio devices and text to audio programmes, loop systems, sub texting
and alternative input for cognitive assistance as well as computer or
electrical assistive devices.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 34



Assistive technology has enabled more forms of making inaccessible
information more accessible. Examples would be screen reading software
such as Openbook, Magic, Job Access with Speech (JAWS) or NonVisual
Desktop Access (NVDA) and text enlargement software such as ZoomText.
Other assistive software could be Read & Write, reader pens such as the
C-pen, Dictaphones and WYNN, which assist students who have difficulties
in reading and writing. SACAP acknowledges the importance of assistive
technology and devices as one way to foster inclusion of students within
higher education.



It is the responsibility of the student to provide their own assistive
technology, device, product, equipment or tool.



In cases where access to assistive technology and devices might be a
barrier to student progression through their studies, the designated SSD
advisor on each campus (who holds responsibilities in terms of
disability support services), will assess, with the relevant Head of SSD
and the Disability Task Team, other potential support mechanisms to meet
the needs of the student, where possible.

Students with disabilities and/or learning differences may be granted
permission to use personal assistance services. 

Personal Assistance Services are a range of services that assist
individuals with disabilities to perform daily activities that the
individual would typically perform if the student did not have a
disability and/or learning difference.



Such services increase the individual's control in life by removing the
element of discrimination and segregation thus allowing for equal
participation. Students with disabilities and/or learning differences,
may make use of Personal Assistants for example, personal aides, guides,
lip-speakers, whisper interpreters, South African Sign Language
interpreters, note-takers and interpreters for Deaf-blind persons.



It is the responsibility of the student to provide their own personal
assistance services.



SACAP acknowledges the importance of Personal Assistance Services. In
cases where access to Personal Assistance Services might be a barrier to
student progression through their studies, the designated SSD advisor on
each campus (who holds responsibilities in terms of disability support
services), will assess, with the relevant Head of SSD, in consultation
with the Disability task team, other potential support mechanisms to
meet the needs of the student, where possible.

Students with disabilities and/or learning differences may be granted
permission to use support, service and/or guide animals. 

SACAP recognises the vital relationship which exists between a person
with a disability and their support, service or guide animal. Support/
service or and/or guide animals shall be permitted entry to all SACAP's
campuses.



The student with a disability is responsible for the care, supervision
and control of their support/ service/ guide animal while on SACAP's
campuses.



SACAP acknowledges the importance of support/ service/ guide animals. In
cases where access to support/ service/ guide animals might be a barrier
to student progression through their studies, the designated SSD advisor
on each campus (who holds responsibilities in terms of disability
support services), will assess, with the relevant Head of SSD, in
consultation with the Disability Task Team, other potential support
mechanisms to meet the needs of the student, where possible.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 35

Students with disabilities and/or learning differences may be granted
concessions for class attendance, learning activities, assessments and
exams. 

Where a concession is granted based on the disclosure process outlined
above, reasonable adjustments, modifications and adaptations will be
made to ensure that academic support is maintained and that the
necessary resources are available to the student. Class attendance,
learning activities, assessments and exams may be changed to accommodate
specific disabilities (for example type of assessment task, mode of
delivery of assessment).



Exam and assessment concessions are granted to enable a student with
specific barriers to learning to demonstrate their true ability in the
examination/assessment process without changing the validity and
integrity of the assessment.

The following must be considered with regard to assessment concessions:


Concessions must not give a student an advantage over other students.



Concessions will not be granted where the primary area of difficulty is
with the language of instruction, teaching and assessment due to the
fact that the language used is not the home language of the student.



A psychological disorder will only be considered where a formal
diagnosis has been made by a Psychologist registered in the relevant
category, Psychiatrist, or medical specialist, and there is proof that
the diagnosis is a significant life challenge or developmental problem
that is impeding on the overall psychological wellbeing and functioning
of the individual.

Technology-based concessions, such as the use of a computer in an
examination, are encouraged because it provides students with
independence in managing needs to prepare for future work-life. However,
strict supervision is required for examinations where a computer or
personal aide is used. Students will be allowed to use their own
laptops, especially if they have a specialised programme installed
(e.g. for visual impairment and/or physical disability). The computer
must first be checked by SSD/Student Administration and the internet
connection disabled.

Student Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Policy The South African
College of Applied Psychology (SACAP) provides a secure and supportive
environment for learning and teaching in which students are stimulated
to reach a high level of academic achievement, regardless of the
selected mode of delivery. SACAP is committed to high standards of
professional and ethical conduct in all activities. Expectations
regarding students' code of conduct are outlined in Section A of this
policy. Procedures relating to deviation from the code of conduct are
outlined in Section B (Student Disciplinary). The SACAP Code of Conduct

studies, as well as other student related activities and/or events.
Drinking or using substances herein defined as any mood-altering
substance that can be abused, or \* Please Note: At any point in time

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 39

to which the individual can become dependent while at College is a
violation of the Student Code of Conduct. Substances could include, but
are not limited to, any illegal drugs and/or narcotics, e.g.
methamphetamine ('tik'), mandrax, cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), or heroin, as
well as legal, moodaltering substances, such as alcohol, painkillers,
codeine, benzodiazepines and other tranquilizers; but excludes bonafide
prescribed use of medication for a recognised medical condition,
prescribed by a medical practitioner: In such instances SACAP reserves
the right to request that the student provide proof of such a
prescription. Being under the influence or the use of substances on
campus will be regarded as a serious offence which may lead to the
dismissal of a student once due process has been followed. SACAP
reserves the right to request a student to undergo a drug test and/or
breathalyser test and/or alco-meter test, at student's own cost, should
it be suspected that the student is under the influence of addictive
substances. A student suspected of being under the influence may, upon
the discretion of the management of the College, also be requested to
undergo a blood and/or drug test administered by a medical practitioner
of SACAP's choice at the student's own cost. A refusal by a student to
undergo any substance test will result in a negative inference being
drawn from the student's refusal to do so.

Students with alcohol and/or substance use/abuse challenges: Concerning
substance use/abuse challenges, the following constitutes a breach of
the Student Code of Conduct: 

When a student fails to inform the College that they have a substance
use/abuse challenge, upon admission or during the course of their
studies.



When a student fails to inform the College when they experience a
drug/alcohol relapse during their studies.



When a student is found using/under the influence of drugs/alcohol
during class, online and on-campus conduct, synchronous and asynchronous
online activities, during the Work Integrated Learning (WIL)
component/module of their studies, as well as other student related
activities and/or events.



When it is found that a student's drug/alcohol use affects their
academic performance and/or College social and professional activities.

Students who experience an alcohol and /or substance use/abuse relapse:


The student must inform the College immediately if they have an alcohol
and/or substance use/abuse relapse. The College has the right to take
action in the instance that the student does not inform the College of
their relapse, when the College is made aware of the relapse by another
party, or the student displays inappropriate behaviour in class, online
or oncampus, during synchronous and asynchronous online activities,
during the Work Integrated Learning (WIL) component/module of their
studies, as well as other student related activities and/or events.



The student must meet with Student Support and Development (SSD), and/or
an Academic Department member, and in certain cases Student
Administration.



Depending on the nature and severity of the situation where abusive,
disruptive and/or inappropriate behaviour on campus, during Work
Integrated Learning, or any settings where the student is engaging in
their capacity as a student of SACAP is evident/reported, disciplinary
action could be taken which could result in the student's immediate
suspension or expulsion.

  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 40

Harassment and Discrimination It is the policy of SACAP to promote an
environment which is a safe and inclusive learning and teaching space
where individuals feel supported and can work and study effectively,
without fear of discrimination, harassment, bullying, vilification,
victimization and/or reprisal as set out by relevant anti-discrimination
legislation. SACAP seeks to be a place where respect and social cohesion
is promoted regardless of race, age, gender identity, nationality,
ethnic or ethno-religious background, religion or creed, pregnancy,
marital status, disability, sexual identity, culture, language or social
background. SACAP commits to creating a climate where students feel
safe, where awareness is promoted, and where inclusive language is
ratified to ensure that students, staff and associated agents of SACAP
recruit and retain a diverse campus community. The relationships that
SACAP staff and educators develop with their students will not provide
any basis for the misuse of power or trust. To support the rights of
individuals to achieve their full potential free from discrimination,
bullying, harassment, victimisation and vilification, SACAP provides a
robust grievances and appeals process that can be used to resolve
complaints of this nature. Please refer to SACAP's Complaints,
Grievances and Appeals policy for more details

Gender-Based Violence: Sexual and gender related misconduct and
implementation protocol on rape and sexual assault cases SACAP
acknowledges sexual and gender related misconduct, rape and sexual
assault as a global problem, occurring in all settings, including
online. Furthermore, it is a profound and widespread problem in South
Africa, impacting on almost every aspect of life. SACAP recognise that
sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) serves to reinforce and
legitimise social, political, and economic inequalities and power
relations in society, affecting the most vulnerable in society. SACAP
commits itself to provide a safe institutional environment where all may
learn, work and go about their duties and activities free from sexual
harassment, sexual violence, gender harassment, gender bullying, sexual
assault, relationship violence, other forms of gender related misconduct
and associated claims of retaliation. Sexual and gender-related
misconduct undermines the dignity and autonomy of those victimised and
erodes mutual trust and respect, which are essential to personal,
academic and professional wellbeing. Sexual and gender related
misconduct constitute a serious disciplinary offence, both in terms of
these guidelines and the law, and will not be permitted, condoned or
tolerated at SACAP. Disciplinary action, including summary dismissal or
academic exclusion may result after following due process. SACAP has a
zero-tolerance approach to sexual and gender related misconduct. It
recognises that it has an obligation to put in place reasonable measures
to ensure, as far as possible, the safety and wellbeing of all students
and staff as part of its institutional and academic duty of care.
SACAP's Student Support and Development Department (SSD) has
disciplinary procedures, guidelines and protocols in place to affirm
SACAP's commitment to preventing sexual and gender related misconduct.
To ensure fairness to both complainants and respondents in situations of
sexual and gender related misconduct, and in line with recognised best
practice, the disciplinary procedures proposed in these guidelines are
separate and different from the general disciplinary rules of the
institution which can be alienating for complainants of sexual and
gender related misconduct. The approach of the disciplinary process,
guidelines and protocols is designed to provide for specialised, prompt,
\* Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 41

thorough and equitable investigation and resolution of complaints that
involve sexual and gender related misconduct. Nothing in these
guidelines prevents complainants from or requires them to report any
violations that constitute criminal offences to the relevant
authorities. Where complainants have opened criminal cases, the
institution will share only such evidence with the criminal justice
authorities as authorised by the parties. Please contact SSD for further
information in this regard.

B:

Disciplinary Code

Any instance of students displaying inappropriate behaviour or behaviour
that raises concern about the mental or emotional state of the student
during their studies at SACAP must be brought to the attention of the
Student Support and Development (SSD) Department. In such cases, the
following process of enquiry is followed: 1. When a concern is raised
about a student's academic performance and/or behaviour, a review
process will begin. The review process draws in feedback from
educator(s), SSD (and in certain cases Student Administration), Academic
staff members, and other students (where necessary). This feedback is
collated along with any related correspondence concerning the student's
previous performance and behaviour while studying at SACAP. 2. The
student will meet with the SSD Department, Student Administration, a
member of the Academic Department, and/or any other staff member(s)
deemed appropriate to attend the meeting. 3. Based on the behaviour
displayed, a decision will be made regarding whether disciplinary action
is to be taken and in what form. 4. In the event disciplinary action is
taken, the outcome could result in one or more of the following: i.

Professional Referral

ii. 

Warning (verbal, first written, final written)

iii. 

Probation (Being monitored)

iv. 

Suspension

v.  

Academic Exclusion

Depending on the severity of the situation, the initial meeting could
result in immediate suspension or expulsion, based on SACAP's
disciplinary committee's recommendation.

Student Suspension The return of a suspended student will be subject to
terms and conditions as determined by SACAP, these may include (but are
not limited to) the following: 1. All suspended students are to attend a
follow-up interview with the SSD Department and a College appointed
Counsellor (at the student's own cost). 2. In the case of a mental
health concern, the student must provide a letter from their treating
psychiatrist, psychologist, or specialist doctor attesting to their
readiness to re-engage in studies. 3. In the case of addiction, the
student: \* Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will
apply in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 42

a. Must provide a letter from a suitably qualified mental health or
health professional confirming that they have been clean and sober for
at least a year before recommencing with their studies at SACAP and
recommending their readiness to reengage with studies. b. Is to supply a
monthly report to Student Support and Development (SSD), from a mental
health/health professional for the duration of their studies. c. Must
provide evidence of ongoing addiction support from a trained mental
health professional.

Disciplinary Procedure 1. In the instance that a student commits a level
one offence that cannot otherwise be resolved informally (see
disciplinary table), an SSD Department member, will consult with the
student and will refer the students to the SACAP disciplinary committee,
should disciplinary action, in accordance with the procedure outlined in
the disciplinary level of offences table, be required. 2. In the
instance of a repeated level 1 offence and any offences from level 2 - 5
the disciplinary procedure outlined in this policy will be followed
based on the severity of the offence. 3. Expulsion would be reserved for
cases of serious misconduct or repeated offences. The seriousness of the
offence will determine the action to be taken and not necessarily, the
number of occasions the transgressions were committed.

Warnings 1. The SACAP disciplinary committee issues warnings. 2.
Students are required to sign the acknowledgement of a warning's
receipt. However, the warning will be binding in the absence of a
student's formal acknowledgement. 3. All warnings will be included in
the student's academic file and will remain in their file for the
duration of the student's studies at SACAP. Student disciplinary
warnings expire when the student completes their qualification. Warnings
will not be placed on a student's academic transcript or record but will
be included in the certificate of conduct. 4. Warnings must be given
within 10 working days after the offence becomes known.

Student disciplinary hearing records do not expire until the student
completes their qualification and graduates

in support of their case after the Disciplinary Hearing Outcome has
already been delivered, the student must provide a solid motivation with
a portfolio of evidence in order to lodge an appeal. 3. A written
response from the College acknowledging receipt of the appeal will be
provided to the student. \* Please Note: At any point in time the latest
policy will apply in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 44

4. An independent non-executive Academic Board member will be appointed
to consider the appeal request ('the Appeal Chairperson'). 5. The Appeal
Chairperson reviews all the documentation of the case as they see fit
(including inter alia the disciplinary hearing notes, audio files,
SACAP's documentation, the disciplinary hearing report, etc.) together
with documentation flowing from points 1, 2 and 3 above. On review of
these documents, the Appeal Chairperson: i.

Can decide that the original disciplinary outcome was fair and as such
stands and the appeal is dismissed, or

ii. 

That there is enough evidence present to substantiate the need of an
Appeal Hearing.

iii. 

Can either conduct the Appeal Hearing themselves or appoint another
impartial Chairperson to conduct the Appeal Hearing.

iv. 

The Appeal Chairperson does not overrule the original disciplinary
decision without an Appeal Hearing having been held. The review before a
Hearing is merely to determine whether the student has cause for an
Appeal Hearing or not.

6.  In the case where an Appeal Hearing is deemed necessary, the Hearing
    is to take place within 10 working days of the Appeal Chairperson
    having reviewed all the relevant documentation.
7.  The Appeal Hearing follows the same general process as a
    Disciplinary Hearing (see above).
8.  The outcome of the Appeal Hearing could rule: 

in favour of the student where a less severe outcome is warranted,



that the original Disciplinary Hearing outcome stands, or



that a more severe outcome is warranted.

9.  The Appeal Hearing Outcome will be announced within 5 working days
    of the Appeal Hearing's conclusion. This decision is final and
    binding on all parties.
10. In the instance that the Appeal Process Ruling is ignored, defied,
    or breached by the student or the institution, legal recourse could
    be actioned.

Appeal Chairperson Fee for Services Rendered: The Appeal Chairperson
will be remunerated for their services rendered. The Appeal Chairperson
must determine who will bear the cost of their services based on their
findings and the Appeals outcome, for example it could be determined
that the student bears the cost of the appeal process.

Access to Student Records: 1. Student records are never destroyed. They
will be archived once the student completes their studies, in a safe,
secure and access controlled database. 2. Students have access to all
their student records on request to the Student Administration office.
3. Student disciplinary documents are kept in electronic format in a
safe, secure and access controlled database. 4. Only authorised members
of staff may access confidential student documents.

Student Complaints, Grievances and Appeals Policy SACAP takes all
complaints, grievances and appeals seriously and provides a robust set
of principles, responsibilities and procedures associated with lodging a
complaint or grievance. The College provides an environment in which
complaints, grievances and appeals are attended to and resolved as
quickly as possible. The College abides by freedom of information and
privacy principles; these include: 

Records of complaints and grievances being kept on student file for at
least 5 years. This does not count against the student's academic record
in any way. Student records are stored and administered in electronic
format in a safe, secure and access controlled database.



Students may request the outcome of the complaint/grievance in writing.



All complaints and grievances are kept in regulation with the Department
of Higher Education and Training and are subject to an annual audit.
This creates transparency between SACAP and the Department of Higher
Education and Training.



Grievances are active for 30 days or until final resolution, even if the
student is no longer studying at SACAP.



The procedures set out in this document do not replace or modify
procedures or any other responsibilities, which may arise under other
higher education provider policies or under statute or any other law.

Definitions 1. Complaint: A complaint is a concern expressed by a
student that something is unsatisfactory or unacceptable. The subject of
a complaint is normally an action, decision, or omission within the
control or responsibility of the College that causes a student to feel
they have been wronged. A complaint is often resolved informally or
through mediation, though it may develop into a grievance if a
resolution cannot be found. 2. Grievance: A grievance is an unresolved
complaint that may result in disciplinary action against a staff member,
or another student or an external inquiry conducted and recommendation
provided if the grievance is against an Educator. 3. Appeal: An appeal
is defined as an urgent and serious request for a decision that has been
taken to be changed, reconsidered or re-examined. PLEASE NOTE: Students
may not lodge a complaint, grievance or appeal if they have deviated
from their responsibilities or from SACAP's Code of Conduct and/or those
standard policies and procedures as described in this handbook.

Student Complaints The following process must be followed: A student may
lodge a complaint by: 1. Completing the complaint form found on MySACAP
in full, with a clear and concise outline of the complaint and the
resolution sought as well as attach all copies of supporting documents
of the complaint where applicable. 2. Submitting the completed complaint
form to the Student Support and Development (SSD) Department via email
only. \* Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply
in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 47

3. The student must make an appointment to speak to the SSD Department
to obtain advice and assistance with the complaint process. 4. The SSD
Department will present the complaint to the relevant authority. 5. The
SSD Department representative will inform the student in writing of
SACAP's recommendation within 14 working days of the complaint having
been addressed in the meeting between SSD Department and the Student. 6.
In some cases, the outcome may be the recommendation for a mediated
meeting held between the complainant and respondent. 7. It should be
noted that the majority of our educators are private contractors to
SACAP. Should a complaint be lodged against one of our private
contractor educators, a formal external inquiry may be conducted and a
recommendation provided by the external inquiry panel. 8. A record of
the student's complaint and the outcome of the matter will be kept in
the Student's Academic Profile. 9. If the student is dissatisfied with
the outcome, the student may escalate the matter by completing the
grievance process. PLEASE NOTE: Complaints submitted via email will be
investigated by SSD and they will encourage the student to complete the
formal process where applicable.

Student Grievances The following process must be followed: A student may
lodge a grievance by: 1. Completing the grievance form found on MYSACAP
in full. This should include details about the grievance under the
following headings: a. The Complainant(s): Person(s) who have escalated
the complaint to grievance b. The Respondent(s): Person(s) against whom
a complaint is made c. Summarise the grievance you have in point form
d. List the relevant dates and timelines pertaining to the grievance.

would not follow SACAP's internal disciplinary action process as
Educators are not in the employ of SACAP. 5. The student will receive
formal feedback about the investigation from the SSD. 6. If the student
is dissatisfied with the formal feedback, they may appeal the decision.

Student Appeals Each student has the right to appeal a decision that has
been taken in relation to the outcome of a grievance procedure. The
following guidelines should be adhered to: 1. A SACAP student is the
only person who can lodge an appeal. 2. The student may lodge an appeal
within 10 working days of receiving the grievance outcome. 3. The
student must fill in the appeals form (found on MySACAP), providing
motivation for the appeal. 4. The student must submit the completed
appeals form to SSD via email only. 5. SSD will escalate the appeal to
the Head of Campus (HoC). 6. The HoC will put together a panel of senior
executive managers (depending on the nature and severity of the
grievance) to investigate the appeal. 7. If an external independent
arbitrator was appointed during the grievance process, a second external
independent arbitrator may be nominated by the HoC to investigate the
appeal. 8. The outcome regarding the appeal will be formally
communicated to the student within fourteen (14) working days. This
decision is final. 9. A record of the student's appeal and the outcome
of the appeal will be kept on the student's profile.

Assessment Appeals All students have the right to appeal an assessment
decision (grade). This excludes grades for examinations. The student is
the only person who can lodge an appeal. The following conditions are
considered valid grounds for an assessment appeal: 

Grade not based on assessment marking criteria, as specified in the
SACAP module outline.



Unfair grade based on stated criteria and quality of work.



Obvious bias affecting the assessment result (NB: This must be supported
by specific evidence/instances).

Please note that the appeal outcome is final and will usually result in
the original grade being replaced with the grade awarded by the
alternative educator, which may be a lower grade. A student may lodge an
appeal by following the process described below: 

The student should first speak to the educator directly and attempt to
resolve the dispute at this level as well as understand the feedback
that was provided. This should be followed up via email between the
student and educator.



If the matter cannot be resolved at this level, the student may proceed
with an assessment appeal.



Students must lodge appeals within 10 working days of notification of
the assessment decision. When lodging an assessment appeal, the student
must complete the form and

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 49

submit it together with proof of payment of the administration fee to
the SSD Department 

The SSD Department alerts the relevant authority of the appeal, who then
conducts an investigation and makes a recommendation towards resolving
the appeal.



The outcome regarding the assessment appeal will be formally
communicated to the student within 14 working days of the student
submitting the appeal.



An alternative educator will be appointed to re-grade the assessment and
their grade will be considered final, irrespective of whether the grade
is higher, lower or remains the same (a grading period of two weeks
applies).



Only one assessment appeal request may be lodged per assessment.

Please Note: The Assessment Appeal Process does not apply to the
following: 

Module engagement



Examinations and open-book assessments



Presentations, including but not limited to Honours Research Day and WIL
oral presentations.

the modules that make up that programme. This information outlines the

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 57

aim and objectives of the programmes and modules, the mode of delivery
(either face-to-face or online), the types of assessment procedures, and
other requirements of the student. Please Note: SACAP reserves the right
to make module changes to any programme as deemed necessary. Students
will be given adequate notice of any impending changes. Students
enrolled in a particular programme can normally expect to complete this
in the format described in official College publications at the time of
their initial enrolment. Where changes to programmes or modules are made
during the period of study, these will not disadvantage students.
Assessment criteria and procedures are consistent with published module
outlines and assessment plans, programme objectives, and workload
expectations. All students studying at SACAP can be assured that the
college is committed to the academic success of its students and
believes it is important to assist students to develop a set of
abilities throughout their studies that will promote academic success.
Throughout the duration of one's studies, students can expect
consistent, fair and helpful feedback on their academic work to be
provided. Mechanisms exist for students to be made aware of their
standard of performance and progress during the period of study. In
order to comply with competencies required academic success at SACAP,
where necessary, students may be guided or counselled and/or referred to
the appropriate academic support services. Formal assessments are
returned and results made available as expeditiously as possible after
their completion. Students have the opportunity to formally appeal their
results through the Assessment Appeal Procedure described in The Student
Handbook.

Study Materials For each module, the following study materials are
provided electronically: 

A module outline: every module has a fully detailed module outline that
includes the module description, learning objectives, prescribed
readings, session topics, and detailed assessment instructions the for
the module.



Prescribed textbook/readings and recommended readings: In the absence of
or in addition to a specific prescribed textbook(s), prescribed and
recommended readings are provided. Furthermore, at the discretion of
educators, students may be provided with additional reading and learning
resources during the course of the module.



The educator may also provide a variety of experiential activities to
reinforce learning (such as role-plays, simulations, small group work,
presentations, and audio-visual work).

Please Note: 

SACAP takes great care in selecting relevant and current literature and
media content to support our learning materials. In some modules,
external online links are provided for students to access these
resources. Unfortunately, on occasion, these external links break down
due to being changed or removed by the original media source, and as
such, a link could be discontinued at any stage. SACAP cannot be held
responsible for an external online resource no longer being available.



Students will need to have Adobe Acrobat Reader software installed on
their personal computers in order to utilize their online study
materials. (http://get.adobe.com/reader/)

In addition to the above, the following is also provided to students
studying in the online mode of delivery: \* Please Note: At any point in
time the latest policy will apply in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 58



Access to Introductory videos that provide an overview of weekly
descriptions and key learning outcomes.



Where applicable, the modules Power Point Presentations and study notes
may be provided.

Textbooks A textbook forms part of the resources for the majority of
modules. Students are required to purchase the prescribed textbook for
the module to be studied. Please Note: Publishers frequently bring out
new editions of textbooks. SACAP has a two-year editions update policy,
whereby the prescribed text named for a particular module will stay in
use for a period of two years from the time of the module being offered
(where possible). Availability of an older edition can be a problem for
students, in which case we encourage students to purchase the newer
edition and check their new edition against the older edition library
copy for any adjustment in page numbers. Where possible SACAP endeavours
to prescribe the latest textbook, however it is likely that students in
one class may have an older/newer edition. The purchase of the
prescribed module textbook is not included in the module price therefore
students will need to pay extra for this.

MySACAP -- Online Learning Management System 

For each module studied (regardless of mode of delivery), students
receive their study materials online via MySACAP, SACAP's online
learning management system (LMS), which enhances the classic classroom
time and experience.



MySACAP utilises the LMS called Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic
Learning Environment). Registered students receive a unique login to
their own workspace online with access to each of the modules they are
registered for in a given term.



MySACAP offers students and educators tools to effectively manage the
administration of their modules. As all study materials are available
online through MySACAP, the student has far more control in how they
manage and utilise their study material. Students can save the study
material to their PC/Laptop/Tablet hard-drive to read directly from, or
to print out.



The MySACAP online workspace includes a calendar to remind students of
important dates, i.e. assignment due dates. There is also a section for
news and announcements to streamline communication between the College,
students, and educators.



Using MySACAP, students also have the ability to submit their
assignments online. Educators can mark assignments online, and provide
students with feedback online.



MySACAP serves as a resource sharing and collaborative learning tool.
Educators can provide students with additional resources for their
learning experience such as additional recommended reading or links to
websites and YouTube videos. As a collaborative learning tool it has an
online discussion forum where students can post questions to their
educators or to their fellow students.



SACAP is aware that occasional technical issues can be frustrating and
as such, we encourage students to download all material to the
PCs/laptops as this facilitates access to material when systems are
down.



A MySACAP "Screen Casts" (i.e. pictograms) sheet has been drawn up to
help students navigate MySACAP more effectively. This document is
available on MySACAP.

SECTION 4:

THE PRINCIPLES, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES OF ASSESSMENT

Assessment and Grading Policy \[Please Note: Please see the Examination
Policy for all relevant information specifically related to SACAP
examinations, the SACAP examination process, and open-book assessments\]
Assessment and grading in higher education serves a number of functions
in relation to teaching and learning. Firstly, assessment and grading is
a way to evaluate a student's learning and communicate to the educator
and to the student whether the student has learned what they needed to
learn and whether the student has achieved the desired learning
outcomes. Secondly, assessment and grading communicates to the student
how they are performing in terms of their understanding and where
improvement is needed. Finally, assessment and grading also communicates
to the educator how effective their teaching has been and whether
adjustments need to be made to ensure effective learning for students.
Within each module of all academic programmes offered at SACAP, students
engage in a range of learning activities for which they receive a grade
(e.g. projects, essays, literature reviews, case studies, role-play
activities, individual and group presentations, and module engagement),
as described in the module outlines. An integrated assessment approach,
which considers a number of outcomes that are assessed together using
different methods and formats, is often utilised to support learning.
The student is, therefore, required to demonstrate an achievement of
multiple outcomes within the assessment task as exemplified in the
module outline and to show that students are able to integrate concepts,
ideas, and actions both within and across modules to achieve competence.

Module development SACAP has developed modules for each programme with
assessment requirements that address the overall aim and learning
outcomes of each module. Module assessment schedules are designed to
integrate theory with practice, to accentuate critical self-reflection,
heighten self-assessment and provide learners with opportunities to make
explicit the skills, knowledge and practices which were previously
implicit. All assessment processes are continuous in nature and in line
with an outcomesbased educational approach and training (OBET). In
general, students are assessed on an on-going basis and in a variety of
methods, both formative and summative. SACAP ensures that assessments
comply with the assessment guidelines included in the applicable
nationally endorsed assessment requirements specified for all accredited
courses. Students are provided with assessment outcomes at the outset of
a given module and reviewed at the end of the module. In both instances
the student is given feedback on their performance against competencies,
and if not achieved, advised as to their future options including
re-submission or re-assessment through the formal appeals process.
Feedback is also given on where improvements can be made.

Formative Assessments Formative assessment is an integral part of each
module within each programme design, and exemplifies one of the
strengths of the teaching and learning approach at SACAP. Formative
assessment is assessment designed to feed into further learning, and is
important for the learning process. Formative assessment measures can be
both formal and informal with the aim to support, \* Please Note: At any
point in time the latest policy will apply in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 60

inform and direct learning throughout the learning process. The focus in
formative assessments is to enhance learning. Students are provided with
comprehensive feedback for all formative assessment tasks in order to
become more effective learners, and with a view to improving student
achievement and to guide their instruction. At the beginning of each
module, students and educators are each provided with a module outline
that outlines for the students the expectations of the learning process
and for the educators the benchmark criteria against which student work
is to be assessed. Assessments may include a variety of media, such as
audio or video recordings as well as written and oral proficiency. Every
assessment decision involves a professional judgement. SACAP bases such
judgements on the following principles: 

A range of evidence is collected.



A variety of assessment methods are used including self-assessment, on
multiple occasions, in a variety of settings, against explicit and
published benchmarks.



Assessment will have a holistic (rather than atomised) focus.



Evidence should be sufficient to make a judgement.



Evidence should be consistent.



Selection of evidence should take into account significance --
critically and frequency.

SACAP has developed modules with assessment requirements that address a
module's overall aim and learning outcomes. Module assessments are
designed to integrate theory with practice, to accentuate critical
self-reflection, heighten self-assessment and provide learners with
opportunities to make explicit the skills, knowledge and practices which
were previously implicit. Formative Assessments are graded by means of
SACAP's general Assessment Guide or against the specific criteria
evident in the module outline where applicable. These assessment
guidelines are provided to both educators and students, and identify all
of the assessment components that are required.

Summative Assessments Summative assessments represent the final
assessment of module content within an academic programme, e.g. a final
examination. Summative assessment has as its aim the evaluation that
learning has taken place, and the extent to which this learning has been
successful. Summative assessments reflect on all the key learning
outcomes as set out in the module outline and addressed throughout the
various sessions of study. Although mid-module tests do occur, they are
primarily prepared as a formative tool of assessment in that they are a
part of ongoing instruction that helps to modify the pace of learning.
By contrast, summative assessments are given to students with a view to
assess their overall learning by addressing the key learning outcomes of
a given module.

Qualities and Evaluation of Assessments In line with the South African
Qualifications Authority (SAQA), SACAP endeavours to ensure that all
assessments that we conduct are: 

Valid: Elements of competencies and types of evidence are defined to
ensure that all assessments are valid and are undertaken by qualified
assessors.



Reliable: Assessments are conducted using structured assessment
processes to ensure consistency of approach.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 61



Fair: Our structured approach provides for a fair, objective assessment
and also allows for educator and student feedback, as well as
re-submission and re-assessment if required.



Flexible: Assessment processes can be adjusted to suit a student's
special needs (e.g. concession requirements for physical impairments).

Assessment grades are recorded on MySACAP via the student's Grade Book.
Educators are expected to provide students with comprehensive feedback
on each assessment to assist in their ongoing learning and academic
writing skills development. Students are provided with assessment
results after the completion of each assessment and an overall module
grade at the end of each module. In both instances, the student is given
feedback on their performance against the key learning outcomes and
competencies, and if not achieved, advised as to their options,
including re-submission or re-evaluation processes. SACAP endeavours to
provide equitable assessments at all times. When planning assessments
SACAP takes into account the diverse needs of our students, including
remote learners, secondary-English speakers, and those with literacy
and/or numeracy challenges. If any concerns arise, these are factored
into SACAP's assessment planning to ensure fair and equitable assessment
practice.

Assessment Practice Roles and Responsibilities Educators: 

Are to ensure that assessments are graded within the required timeframe,
usually within two weeks of the due date, unless otherwise indicated in
the module outline.



Are to provide constructive and comprehensive feedback to students on
their assessments.



Must upload all graded assessments onto MySACAP and complete the
students' online gradebooks.



Must inform Student Support and Development of all instances of
plagiarism and where students are struggling academically.



Must inform Student Support and Development of all re-submissions by
completing the relevant tracking forms.

Students: 

Must be cognisant of all assessment requirements for each module as
stipulated in the relevant module outline.



Must upload their assessments by the specified due date.



Should be aware of SACAP's assessment processes and policies.



Must ensure that all assessments are submitted in Microsoft Word format
adhering to the latest APA guidelines.



Should an assessment be submitted in an incorrect format (i.e. not in
MSWord or a corrupted file), a grade of zero will apply.

Preparing for assessments At the start of each module, students are
provided with a module outline that details the assessment requirements
for that module. In consultation with their educator, students should
ensure that they understand what is expected from them for each
assessment, including their assessment due dates. \* Please Note: At any
point in time the latest policy will apply in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 62

Load-Shedding Load-shedding is a South African reality. As such, it is
the student's responsibility to ensure that they make the necessary
arrangements to complete their assessments timeously and ensure that
their assessments are submitted by the prescribed due date in order to
avoid late penalties even in the event of load-shedding.

Similarity Checking Software Similarity checking software allows for
student written work to be uploaded and matched for similarity against
content on the web and all other assessments submitted through SACAP's
similarity checking software. All final assessment submissions will
automatically be checked for similarity and will generate a similarity
report. A similarity report identifies the similarity of the source in
an assessment and a percentage of the match. The similarity report does
not detect plagiarism. It merely highlights similarity within a
comparative database. The similarity score serves as an indicator for
further investigation and it will always be up to an educator or Student
Support and Development on the campus to determine if there has been
plagiarism. If plagiarism is found it will be dealt with in accordance
with the Academic Integrity Policy. SACAP recognises the use of
similarity checking software to support good academic writing practices,
such as paraphrasing and citing sources. Therefore, all students are
offered the opportunity to submit a draft of written work through the
similarity checking software to check their own work and self-correct
prior to final submission. As such, similarity checking software is used
to develop academic writing practices by allowing students to submit
drafts of written work prior to final submission in order to
self-correct and to check all final assessment submissions for
similarity against databases.

Video and Audio Recordings Should an assessment require a video
submission, students are required to upload the video file with their
written assessment on MySACAP using the VoiceThread link provided under
the relevant session. All video file submissions must be compatible for
viewing on all major devices. Please note that if these recording
requirements are not met the assessment will be marked as incomplete
(fail). In the event that a student experiences technical challenges in
submitting their video file, the student needs to contact the relevant
campus Student Support and Development and/or Administration team
immediately for assistance. The student must ensure that they make
contact with the Student Administration team before the assessment due
date and time. SACAP provides recording facilities on campus for
students to make use of. Students are asked to schedule their recording
sessions in the diary at Reception.

Assessment Extensions SACAP recognises that there are times when
students may not be able to submit assessments by specified due dates
due to extenuating circumstances. In these instances, students may
request for an assessment extension. Assessment extension requests are
granted at SACAP's discretion. SACAP considers the following extenuating
circumstances grounds for an assessment extension:

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 63



Medical Reasons - In the instance where an unforeseen medical condition
prevents the student from completing an assessment by the stipulated due
date.



Family/Personal Reasons - In the instance that unforeseen
personal/family death/severe illness of an immediate family member
(i.e. spouse/partner, parent, child, sibling) or legal guardian.



Employment Related Reasons - Unforeseen employment challenges.

In the event that the assessment extension reason falls outside of this
list, the student is advised to immediately consult with the relevant
campus Student Support and Development and/or Administration team for
further guidance. All assessment extension requests must be submitted
three (3) consecutive days prior to the due date, along with relevant
supporting documentation. It is not sufficient to provide only a
personal statement outlining the extenuating circumstances. Statements
made by parents/guardians, spouses/partners, immediate relatives, or
close friends will not be considered as 'independent documentation' for
these purposes. Supporting documentation could include, but is not
limited to a death certificate, a medical certificate (stating the
diagnosis and specific dates), or a letter from the student's employer's
Human Resources Department (e.g. for specific work requirements or
travel arrangements with dates and times). SACAP reserves the right to
contact anyone referenced in the supporting documentation. No longer
than a maximum period of 14 calendar days may be granted for assessment
extensions. Process to be followed: 

All requests must be submitted to the relevant campus Student Services
and/or Student Administration Department.



Once documentation is received, students will be advised of the outcome
via email.



Important: Students are to continue preparing their assessments while
awaiting feedback on their extension request.



The educator will endeavour to grade the assignment as expediently as
possible. The graded assessment will be returned via MySACAP and
standard grading timeframes will apply.



This policy applies to both on campus and online students for all online
learning activities and assessments.



Please note: Should an assessment extension be granted, the extension
due date is considered final and any assessment submitted thereafter
will not be graded.

Assessment Penalties Penalties represent consequences of not adhering to
the regulations and/or criteria stipulated for each assessment.
Conditions for every assessment are presented in the module outlines.
Educators must apply penalties to the assessments and the final grade
uploaded on MySACAP.

Word Count Penalties The degree of penalty (e.g. projects, essays,
literature reviews, case studies, individual and group presentations) is
based on the suggested word count for the particular module assessment
indicated in a Module outline. If a student goes over the word count
limit, the following penalties should be applied:

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 64

1. Students will not be penalised if they exceed the stipulated word
count limit by up to a maximum of 10%. 2. Thereafter, if the word count
exceeds the permitted 10%, then 10% will be deducted from the overall
assessment grade. 3. Any content over and above 20% of the stipulated
word count limit will not be considered towards the final grade. In
other words, students will NOT be graded on content that is outside of
the accepted word count.

Tiered Penalties for Late Assessment Submission A tiered approach looks
at different levels (tiers) of penalties depending on the students'
level of study. It is important to note: 

The degree of penalty is based on the module's NQF level rather than the
student's actual year of study.



Every module outline indicates the module's particular NQF level.



These penalties are not accumulative, but rather a fixed percentage that
is applied depending on the day of lateness.



Penalties apply to consecutive calendar days including weekends and
public holidays.



The late submission penalties below do not apply to open-book
assessments. The Examination and Open-Book Assessments Policy should be
consulted for penalties applied to open-book assessments.

penalty will be applied during this period. Assessments submitted after
the agreed to negotiated day will not be graded and will automatically
receive a fail. Any late assessments without an approved extension or

Re-submission of Assessments (Not examinations) Should a student fail to
pass an assessment (excluding phased assessments, continuous
assessments, forum discussions, and reflection journals), i.e. failure
to meet satisfactory academic and competency standards, the educator may
offer one opportunity for re-submission of that assessment provided the
student receives a grade for the first assessment of between 35%-49%.
Please note: Resubmissions are only permissible if a paper legitimately
falls within the 35%-49% range. Grades below 35% will receive a fail. If
the grade is only a fail due to late penalties, a resubmission is not
warranted and the final grade stands. 

The student will receive feedback on the original assessment to clearly
indicate why the assessment has not been passed and what needs to be
addressed to reach a satisfactory academic and competency standard in
order to pass.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 66



The educator will inform both the student and the relevant campus
Student Support and Development and/or Administration team that a
resubmission has been offered and that they can submit the re-worked
assessment onto MySACAP within one week (7 calendar days) after
receiving their original grade. The educator is required to inform
Student Administration of the due date for the re-submission.



When a resubmission is offered, the student is required to leave the
original copy of the assessment on MySACAP and add the re-submission.

Please note the following: 

Students are entitled to resubmit an assessment only once, i.e. they can
resubmit a failed (reworked) assessment for marking on one occasion
only.



The final grade for all re-submissions (based on an original failed
assessment) is either a pass or fail (i.e. no more than 50% in general,
and 60% for those specific modules where the minimum pass mark is
stipulated as such). The re-submission mark will be regarded as the
final mark for the assessment in question.



Students are not permitted to request the re-submission of an assessment
in order to gain a higher level grading.



Students must pay an administration fee for every resubmitted
assessment.

Please see the SACAP's Assessment Appeal Procedure in the instance a
student chooses to appeal the outcome of an assessment.

Repeated module assessments In the instance a student fails a module and
has to repeat it, they may not resubmit the same assessments they
previously submitted the first time they attempted the module. Should a
student submit an assessment that was previously submitted for grading,
this will constitute self-plagiarism, and the SACAP Academic Integrity
will then be applied.

Re-evaluation assessment prior to completing a programme Please note:
Not to be confused with a supplementary exam (see Examination policy) or
assessment resubmission (see above). When a student fails a final
module, with an overall grade of between 45-49%, within their final term
of a qualification (with the exception of the Work Integrated Learning
modules), they may be offered the opportunity to write a summative
re-evaluation assessment rather than repeat the entire module. Such a
re-evaluation assessment (once-off) replaces all previous assessments
for that module and gives the student an opportunity to pass the module
with a maximum passing grade of 50%. A re-evaluation assessment must be
arranged and completed within a set time as determined by the relevant
campus Student Administration team. A student submitting a re-evaluation
assessment will be required to pay a set fee for this assessment, and on
completion will receive a pass/fail grade. Conditions for
re-evaluation: 1. For exam modules: The student must apply for a
supplementary exam. If they fail the supplementary exam, they must
repeat the module. 2. For non-exam modules: A re-evaluation can only be
offered for a final module, if the student has attempted to fulfil all
requirements (e.g. submitted all re-submissions but failed). \* Please
Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any given
situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 67

Repeating a module to improve a student's Grade Point Average (GPA)
Students wishing to improve their GPA must consult with the relevant
campus Student Support and Development and/or Administration team
regarding their options to repeat modules in accordance with the
following terms and conditions: 

During a qualification: For any repeated module within a qualification,
both the original final grade and the repeated final grade for the
module will reflect on the student's final qualification transcript.



After completing a qualification: For a student who has already
completed a qualification, but who wants to improve their grade for a
particular module, they will be registered as a modular student and an
additional supplemental transcript for the repeated module(s) will be
provided in addition to their completed qualification transcript.



In all cases, repeating a module will be subject to module availability,
a qualification's maximum prescribed time, and class size limits.

Examination Policy Summative Assessments Summative assessments represent
the final assessment of module content within an academic programme.
Summative assessment usually has as its aim the evaluation that learning
has taken place, and the extent to which this learning has been
successful. Summative assessments are given to students with a view to
assessing student achievement of targeted key learning objectives or
learning goals over the whole learning cycle of a given module. If the
intention is to measure the 'sum of the learning', a summative
assessment is recommended. Although mid-module assessments occur, they
are primarily used to support, inform and direct learning throughout the
learning process.

Written Examinations (Campus-Based Model of Teaching and Learning)
Examinations are written in a limited number of modules throughout both
academic and professional programmes. Examination papers are stored in
the Student Administration department and only released on the day of
the assessment as follows: 

Examinations are disseminated to students with an invigilator present.



Students are required to strictly abide by the rules and regulations in
this Examination Policy.



The invigilator is responsible for collecting the examination question
paper along with the students' answer sheets at the end of each
examination.



Should the invigilator not be the educator grading the examination
papers, they must ensure that the written examinations are given to the
student administrator on each campus. The student administrator must
then give the written examination scripts to the module educator for
grading.



Students will receive their grades within two weeks of completing an
examination.

Campus-Based Student Code of Conduct during Examinations 

Students are responsible for bringing their own stationery. No borrowing
and lending of

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 68

stationery will be permitted once the examination has commended. 

No electronic equipment will be allowed into the examination room. This
includes but is not limited to tablets, laptops, music/media players,
smart watches, and cellular telephones. Students may bring a calculator
as and when required.



There is no food or eating allowed in the examination room.



There is to be complete silence during an examination. This includes at
the start and ending of an examination period. Students need to be made
aware that talking will result in their examination scripts being
removed.



Students are to stay seated while writing the examination. Students are
to put their hand up if they have a question. The invigilator will come
to a student to answer any questions they may have.



No explanation of the examination questions may be asked or given.



Students may not leave the exam room within the last 20 minutes of the
examination.



Should a student need to leave the exam venue while the exam is in
progress, they must be accompanied by an invigilator.



Students may leave the examination room once they have handed in their
examination paper, question paper, and any scrap paper to the
invigilator.



Cheating is strictly prohibited and will result in a zero grade and
disciplinary action. Students caught cheating will be removed from the
exam venue immediately and the Student Support and Development
Department will be notified.



No assistance may be given or received by another student during the
examination.



Students must stop writing as soon as the invigilator ends the
examination.



No student may keep the examination question paper.

Campus-Based Student Examination Venues The examinations will be written
in one of the campus classrooms unless otherwise stipulated.

Open-Book Assessments Certain examinations will take the form of
open-book assessments. These assessments are administered via MySACAP
under examination conditions during the course of a student's studies.
Open-book assessments have time limits that are tightly controlled
through MySACAP. At the predesignated time and date, the open-book
assessment question paper will become available for download in the
MySACAP classroom. Students are then required to complete the assessment
within the allotted time and upload their answer sheet on MySACAP before
the stipulated deadline. Students will only have one opportunity to
submit the assessment and will be unable to retrieve their work once
submitted. The following rules and conditions apply to open-book
assessments: 

Students must ensure that they have a stable internet connection for the
full duration of an open-book assessment.



Open-book assessments have tightly controlled time limits that are
managed via MySACAP. As such, once the student has opened the assessment
they must effectively utilise the allocated time provided to complete
the assessment. Students are, therefore, advised to

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 69

plan and manage their time efficiently during an open-book assessment to
ensure that they have enough time to download, complete, and upload
their work before the designated deadline. 

Extra time will be allocated before and after an open-book assessment to
provide students with enough time to download and upload their work. All
students writing open-book assessments are allowed an additional 5
minutes before the start to download and prepare for the assessment as
well as an additional 10 minutes at the end to upload their answer
sheets. The additional time provided is not for completion of the
open-book assessment but for the submission of the open-book assessment.



Students will only have one opportunity to submit an open-book
assessment within the prescribed time limit determined by SACAP. Should
the student exceed the time limit provided, a grade of zero may be
assigned.



Once the open-book assessment has been submitted online, the student
will not be able to retrieve it again.



No student may seek outside assistance to complete an open-book
assessment (e.g. from an educator or peer).



Students may not discuss the content of an open-book assessment with
others.



No open-book assessment may be submitted via email or hardcopy.
Assessments submitted in these formats will not be accepted and/or
graded.



All answers should be written in the student's own words and all sources
must be cited accordingly and accurately according to the most recent
APA guidelines, unless stated otherwise in the assessment criteria.
Answers that have been copied and pasted from any source is considered
plagiarism and the process for managing plagiarism, as outlined in the
Academic Integrity policy, will be followed.

Please note: Plagiarism found in an open-book assessment or examination
is considered cheating and a 0% grade will be allocated. In such a case,
a supplementary exam or reassessment will not be permitted.

Open-Book Assessments and Loadshedding Loadshedding is a South African
reality. However, it is the student's responsibility to ensure that they
make arrangements around load-shedding to complete their open-book
assessments. In the event of load-shedding, the student is required to
check their loadshedding schedule and, if it is during the time of the
open-book assessment, make suitable arrangements to go where
uninterrupted Wi-Fi is available during loadshedding to sit the
assessment, such as a SACAP. The student must ensure that their laptops
have sufficient battery to last the duration of loadshedding, and if
necessary have mobile data available to use their phone as a Wi-Fi
hotspot for downloading and uploading the open-book assessment as a
backup solution.

Late Arrival for Examinations Written Examinations: A student who
arrives more than 20 minutes late for a final written examination or
supplementary examination, and does not inform the Student
Administrator/Head of Student Support with valid reasons for their
lateness, will automatically fail the examination and may have to repeat
the module. Oral Presentation Examinations: \* Please Note: At any point
in time the latest policy will apply in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 70

A student who arrives more than 10 minutes late for their final oral
presentation, and does not inform the WIL Coordinator/Programme
Coordinator and/or Student Administrator/Head of Student Services with
valid reasons for their lateness, will automatically fail the oral
examination.

Examination Absenteeism It is imperative that students are present for
their examinations. In the event of unavoidable absenteeism (e.g. sudden
illness/accident, death in his/her immediate family), the student or a
relative must inform SACAP immediately prior to the examination, and
should follow up with a written motivation letter to the Head of Student
Services within a week explaining their absenteeism and provide a
doctor's certificate where necessary. If a student does not attend an
examination and does not inform Student Administrator/Head of Student
Services of the reasons for their absenteeism, the student will
automatically fail the examination and may have to repeat the module.

Examination and Open-Book Assessment Grading 

Graded examination scripts will not be returned to students.



Students will not be allowed to see their graded examination scripts.
The reasons for this are as follows: o

All exams are graded using a standardised answer sheet (memorandum).

o

Educators do not engage in corrective marking or provide feedback on
examinations.

o

The grade provided by an educator is regarded as final.

Special Examinations - Concessions There are two types of concession
applications: 1. Based on medical condition(s), which significantly
compromise the student's ability to write a test or examination under
normal conditions. 2. Based on barriers to learning, such as significant
chronic physical disabilities and/or learning differences, which
compromises the student's test or examination performance (e.g.
dyslexia, cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness).

The Application Process for a Concession: i.

Existing and Valid Concession Report

A student with an existing concession assessment or medical report
conducted by an experienced, suitable qualified professional (e.g. an
Educational Psychologist or Medical Practitioner) needs to submit this
report to the Head of Student Services at the beginning of term. The
College reserves the right to request an updated concession assessment
report provided by a relevant registered mental or medical health
professional and submitted to the Head of Student Services. ii.

New Concession Report Application



A mental or medical health professional will generate a concession
report and make recommendations based on which concession(s) the student
qualifies for.



Students must submit concession reports to the Head of Student Services
and complete an

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 71

application form for a concession at the beginning of term. 

The Head of Student Services will forward the concession assessment
report and application to the Academic Department who will make the
final decision to grant the concession.



The final decision made by the Academic and Student Services departments
is binding.



Student Services will inform the student in writing if the concession is
granted or declined by the Academic Department.



The Academic Department will inform the educator(s) of the concession
conditions, related to the specific student.



The student may appeal the decision made by the Academic Department.

Examination Conditions for a Student with a Disability 

Students will be allowed to use their own laptops only in cases where a
special programme has been loaded to compensate for the impairment, for
example, Visual impairment and/or Physical disability. The laptop must
be checked by SACAP. The internet connection may be disabled.



There will be strict supervision for examinations where a computer is
used.



SACAP can provide a clean USB stick for student use where necessary.



Oral examination with recording and/or scribe facilities may be made
available as an alternative option.



Students with a disability will be allowed additional time to complete
the examination, dependent on the condition, i.e. extra 15 minutes per
hour of the exam.



Scribes/readers: In the situation where a scribe/reader is required to
assist a student during an exam, the following applies: o

A trained scribe/reader must be arranged by and paid for by SACAP.

o

The scribe/reader must sign off on the examination.

Deferred Examinations under Special Circumstances A student's
application to write an examination outside of the term's published
examination timetable due to a medical and/or other emergency must be
submitted with written motivation and relevant supporting documentation
prior to the examination date as published on the examination timetable.
All rescheduled sittings for examinations will be administered and
supervised by Student Administration. Procedure: Students must submit a
formal written request to the campus Student Administration Office. The
student will be informed via email by the Student Administration Office
whether the request has been granted or denied. Summary of reasons why a
student may apply for writing an examination outside of the published
examination timetable: 

Emergency travel arrangements: For unavoidable travel arrangements only
in cases of emergency, i.e. death, severe illness in the immediate
family, or work.



Illness: For a medical emergency, or severe illness. A medical
certificate is required. In the

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 72

case of a planned medical procedure, students are required to inform
Student Administration at least one month in advance of the examination
date. 

Pregnancy: In the case that the new-born's arrival date conflicts with
the published examination schedule. A medical certificate is required.
In the case of a planned caesarean, students are required to inform
Student Administration at least one month in advance of the examination
date.



Disability: see above.

Supplementary Exams Please note: This only applies to modules that have
examinations. This is not to be confused with a re-evaluation assessment
or assessment resubmission (see Assessment Policy). 

Where an overall module grade falls within 45% -- 49%, a supplementary
exam may be granted. A student receiving this grade has the option to
write a supplementary exam.



Students who pass the supplementary exam will receive a maximum grade of
50% for the supplementary exam. This grade will be the new overall
module grade.



Supplementary examinations will be written within the supplementary exam
week of the following term.



The format of the paper will be of a similar nature to the original
examination.



The supplementary exam will be a full summative evaluation of the module
content (i.e. it will cover the learning outcomes of the module).



Invigilation for the supplementary to be arranged by SACAP.



It is the student's responsibility to consult MySACAP regarding their
supplementary exam timetable, and to contact Student Administration
should they have any queries. SACAP will not be held responsible for
those students who are not aware of their scheduled supplementary
exam(s).



Supplementary examination fees will apply and be added to the student's
account.

Cheating Cheating in an examination or open-book assessment is contrary
to the College's Student Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics. Students
caught cheating will be given a zero for the examination and
disciplinary action will be taken.

The College Grading System Educators are required to make formal
assessment decisions and communicate such decisions to students in
consultation with the Student Administrator within two weeks of the
formal assessment event or task. Contact educators complete an
attendance register for each module taught during a term. This is done
on MySACAP each week during the class session. All assessments,
assessment grades and class participation grades are to be submitted via
MySACAP. MySACAP calculates the overall module grade for each student.
The Student Administrator downloads the marks and grades for assessments
completed; the results are checked and entered into a student management
system. Students are then informed that grades are published, but still
subject to the moderation process. Once the moderation process is
complete students are informed that their grades are final. \* Please
Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any given
situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 73

A module generally involves at least two formal assessments. Each
assessment carries a percentage weighting of the total mark. Each
assessment is generally accompanied by an attachment with specific
guidelines to assist students in the development or presentation of an
assessment. These guidelines are intended to assist students to meet the
assessment standards and learning outcomes. For their overall academic
performance in a module, students are awarded a grading of: 

Excellent (A),



Above Average (B),



Average (C),



Below Average (D),



Unacceptable (F),



Re-evaluation (RE), or



Incomplete (IC)

Likewise, this also applies to a student's performance in a specific
assessment event or task. In order to obtain a pass in a module,
students must obtain a minimum of a D in each of the assessments of a
module. Grades are determined according to the allocation of marks per
assessment. Each assessment carries a percentage of the total mark.
Educators mark each assessment and then determine the grade for that
assessment. Students receive a grade for each assessment submitted.
Grades are published on MySACAP, on a user's profile, once the process
of moderation has been completed. Academic Transcripts are available for
collection from the Student Administration, for a fee (refer to relevant
form). Should there be a balance outstanding on a student's account; a
transcript will not be provided.

Grading Formal Assessments Please note that educators need to be mindful
that they will be required to adhere to standardised marking practices.
All papers are open to moderation at any time and will adhere to these
required academic standards. However, SACAP will show sensitivity and
respect to educators and students at all times, for example due to the
confidential nature of some module assessments discretion will be shown
where needed. There are common learning objectives students should
demonstrate: 

Factual knowledge about the subject,



An awareness of existing criticisms of the knowledge and theory,



The ability to critically reflect and articulate their own thoughts and
opinions, and



The ability to concisely synthesize these theoretical aspects together
with practice.

The General Assessment Marking Guidelines for formal assessments and for
participation grading is to be applied to all assessments, unless an
assessment has a specific marking rubric in the module outline.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

45%-49%

Only applicable for those modules that include an examination. This is
only applicable based on the final overall mark for a module. A student
receiving this grade has the option to sit a third assessment based on
the overall module material in an effort to improve the overall final
grade. Students who pass the assessment will receive 50% for the module.

IC

Incomplete Refers to a variety of circumstances that are currently
affecting the recording of marks against the specified assessment
criteria in a module or unit of study.

Module Completion Policy "Incomplete" Modules Students who do not
satisfy the requirements for a credential are required to discuss their
situation with the educator and Student Administrator/Online Mentor
within 10 working days of the published result. Where a grading of Fail,
Re-evaluation, or Incomplete is made, the student will be given the
opportunity to: 

Negotiate a Study Plan with the Student Administrator.



Appeal via the completion of the Assessment Appeal Form.

If the student does not appeal their incomplete module within 10 working
days of the published result, the grading of Fail, Re-evaluation, or
Incomplete will remain until such time that the student chooses to redo
the module and the assessment requirements in order to pass. Should a
student fail to meet satisfactory competency standards in a module, and
if every effort has been made to assist a student in this objective,
then the student is required to meet with the Head of Student
Services/Online Mentor. The student will be required to redo the module
and meet the cost associated with this.

Module Engagement The platform for engagement in a module's sessions
provides students with an opportunity to discuss the content, share
their understanding of the content, and to ask relevant questions to
facilitate deeper learning. Module engagement provides the student with
an opportunity to earn grades based on the degree of, and quality of
their engagement with the module material and activities assigned by
their educator.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 76

Educators assess student engagement throughout the course of their
modules. A student's engagement will be evaluated based on the criteria
made explicit in the engagement rubric (found in the module outline) and
will contribute 20% to the overall grade for the module. The criteria
comprise of peer interaction, the quality of comments, preparation,
session contributions, and the student's attitude within the learning
environment.

Publishing of Module Results At the end of each academic trimester, the
relevant campus Student Administration Department publishes a list of
class results by module. Provisional and final grades will be released
via MySACAP. A general communication via MySACAP will be sent to all
current students indicating that the moderation process is concluded and
final grades are released.

Rules of Academic Progression Policy The Higher Education Qualifications
Sub-Framework (HEQSF) is designed to facilitate vertical, horizontal,
and diagonal progression. SACAP recognises the need for having processes
in place to promote early detection of students who are making
unsatisfactory progress and are, therefore, at risk of failing to
complete their qualification within the planned period of study. The
following procedure is designed to identify students who are at risk and
may need assistance through intervention strategies: 

To progress within the Diploma in Counselling and Communication Skills,
the Bachelor of Applied Social Science, Bachelor of Social Work or
Bachelor of Psychology programmes, students have to successfully
complete a minimum of 80% of the credit value for a given year. This
includes the completion of the Academic Literacy module within the first
academic year of study.



A student may not fail the same module more than twice within an
academic year. Should the student exceed this number, the student may be
placed under academic performance review (See Academic Performance
Review Policy) or be asked to suspend their studies. This is reviewed on
a case by case basis.

Completion of a Programme: In order to graduate students are required to
complete the prescribed modules including all pre- and co-requirements,
assessments and attendance requirements within the prescribed maximum
period of study (based on the specific programme of study) and students
are required to have met any conditions associated with their initial
registration. 

A student who fails to complete the requirements for the Diploma in
Counselling and Communication Skills, the Bachelor of Applied Social
Sciences, Bachelor of Social Work or Bachelor of Psychology programmes
may not be awarded an early exit qualification.



Should a student wish to deregister from their original qualification,
they may be considered to apply for another cognate qualification. In
these instances, students may apply for credit transfer of those modules
that have the same credit value, NQF level, and content in the new
qualification, as long as they comply with the rules of the CAT policy
and any credits awarded do not exceed 50% of the new qualification.



Students' study plans may vary within a given academic year due to term
class allocation requirements. However, students may not deviate from
the prerequisite module sequence within individual programmes.

Academic Performance Review Policy Academic Performance Review (APR) is
a developmental process including intervention, monitoring, and
reviewing a student's progress with the aim of improving the student's
academic standing. The onus remains on the student to take
responsibility for their own learning and use the resources made
available to them. The supportive interventions engaged in under the
academic performance review may include, but are not limited to the
following: 

Probation for a specified period;



Professional referral and/or career assessment with written feedback (on
campus or external);



Compulsory academic counselling and workshop attendance;



Adjustment of study plan and workload; and



Other conditions may accompany the above.

A student could be placed under an academic performance review in the
event of the following: 

Failing two or more modules in the same term;



Failing the same module twice in the academic programme;



Three incomplete grades due to non-submission of assessments across the
programme of study; and/or



A pattern of poor class attendance and/or module engagement.

The academic performance review procedure is carried out as follows: 1.
The student is identified by Student Support and Development, the
Programme Coordinator, and/or by an Educator by completing a Student
Tracking Form. 2. The Department of Student Support and Development
notifies the student that has been placed on academic performance review
and sends the student with a number of interventions to enhance their
academic performance and/or development. 3. The student selects a
suitable intervention from the list provided. Thereafter, and the
Student Support and Development Department records this in writing and
can request a report back from the student after the completion of the
intervention as part of the academic performance review process.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 81

4. Student Support and Development must communicate to the student,
verbally and in writing, the conditions of the academic performance
review. For example, that the student needs to pass all the modules that
are taken during the term in which they are under review. 5. Student
Support and Development must ensure that the student understands the
consequences for not meeting the conditions of the academic performance
review. For example, that failing a module again could result in the
student remaining under academic performance review for another term. 6.
Once the academic performance review period has passed, a second meeting
will be held with the student and the Department of Student Support and
Development will review the student's academic progression. 7. A copy of
the outcome of the academic performance review process is retained in
the student's file for the duration of their studies. 8. In the event
that the student has not met of maintained satisfactory academic
progress to be removed from being assigned academic performance review
status, the student will receive a formal written notification that they
have not met or maintained satisfactory academic progress and have been
re-assigned academic performance review status. 9. If after two
consecutive terms of being on APR a student has not made adequate
progress, then the student will be asked to defer and/or extend their
studies. Failure to adhere to the conditions of academic performance
review as determined by the Department of Student Support and
Development can result in a disciplinary hearing. Should the student
wish to appeal the outcomes of the disciplinary process, they should
follow the procedures outlined in the Student Complaints, Grievances and
Appeals Policy.

Student Class Attendance Policy The Department of Higher Education and
Training (DHET) recognises the positive correlation between class
attendance and both student retention and achievement. Any class session
or activity missed, regardless of cause, reduces the opportunity for
learning and may adversely affect a student's achievement in their
module. SACAP prides itself on the quality of its teaching and learning
and the unique educational philosophy that sets us apart from other
institutions. Attendance is a critical component of our educational
philosophy and facilitative learning style. This facilitates the
acquisition of knowledge as well as the application of skills through
the engagement in our teaching and learning environment. Students who
arrive late have an impact not just on their own learning but also on
the progress of the rest of the class. SACAP, therefore, sets high
expectations of attendance and punctuality in the teaching and learning
environment. Absenteeism not only compromises the student and peers
experience, but also the class dynamic, which is critical to SACAP's
facilitative learning style.

A. Minimum requirements for Attendance at SACAP 1. SACAP encourages full
attendance for all modules, regardless of mode of delivery. 2. For
on-campus classes, the minimum requirement is 80% attendance in a
module, e.g. 8 out of 10 classes, unless otherwise specified in the
module outline. 3. Online student attendance is monitored and tracked
through student engagement. After two weeks of non-engagement, the
educator will complete a student tracking form and submit it to the
Student Support and Development (SSD) Department to follow up with the
student. \* Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will
apply in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 82

4. All student's asynchronous online activities are monitored and
tracked through student engagement. After two weeks of non-engagement,
the educator will complete a student tracking form and submit to the
Student Support and Development (SSD) Department to follow up with the
student. 5. The following modules are exceptions to the minimum
requirement of 80% attendance in a module: 

Bachelor of Social Science Honours research thesis workshops (all
sessions compulsory)



Master of Social Science 10-week modules, workshops, and 4-day
intensives (all sessions compulsory)



Individual and group mentor coaching (PGDC) (all sessions compulsory)



Observed coaching sessions (PGDC) (all sessions compulsory)



Coaching intensive modules (all sessions compulsory)



For Work Integrated Learning /practicum module(s), please refer to the
Work Integrated Learning (WIL) policy.

6.  SACAP requires that students attend all classes for the full
    duration of class. Students arriving more than 15 minutes late or
    who leave more than 15 minutes early, will be regarded as absent for
    that class on the basis of lateness.
7.  Students who have not met the minimum requirements described in
    point 2 will fail the module and the module will have to be repeated
    at the full module cost.
8.  Students who have not met the minimum requirements for attendance as
    described in point 2 above, may request leniency by following the
    process described in Section C (Conditions for requesting leniency).

B. Recording Student Class Attendance Class Attendance Process for
recording class attendance: 

Attendance registers are completed by the educator on SACAP's Learning
Management System (LMS), MySACAP.



Educators are required to log into their MySACAP account during class
time to record attendance.



It is the responsibility of the student to keep track of their module
attendance by viewing the online attendance sheet on a regular basis.



If the student has a query concerning the attendance register not being
marked accurately, it is the responsibility of the student to follow up
with the educator within 10 working days of the class (no queries may be
submitted after this time). Class attendance may not be queried after
the commencement of the next term.



If a student's name is not on the class attendance list, the educator
must direct the student to Student Administration immediately.



If a student whose name is on the class list has not attended Week 1,
educators are asked to notify Student Administration.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 83

C. Conditions for Requesting Leniency Students who have not met the
minimum requirements for attendance as described above can request
leniency from the SSD Department. 

Leniency will not be considered if the relevant supporting documentation
has not been provided.



Documentation supporting the absence of either of the first two missed
classes of a module cannot be considered in a leniency request, because
these fall within the accepted parameters for absenteeism.



Leniency may only be considered on the third missed class of a module.



If four or more classes are missed, leniency will not be considered
regardless of whether supporting documentation can be provided. In cases
where four or more classes have been missed the student should consult
with the SSD Department regarding SACAP's deferral policy.



The SSD Department will look at all leniency requests on a case-by-case
manner to ensure the best possible outcome is achieved.



The decision to grant leniency is at the discretion of SACAP and any
decision made is final.

Process for Requesting Leniency: For leniency to be considered by SACAP,
the following process should be adhered to: 

Documentation supporting a leniency request for the third missed class
must be provided to the SSD Department.



All supporting documentation needs to be provided within 10 working days
of the third missed class.



The mitigating circumstances considered for leniency include, but are
not limited to the following: o

religious holidays

o

emergency medical procedures

o

ill health

o

unforeseen immediate family emergencies



Vacations and work commitments are not seen as a valid reason for class
absenteeism.



The SSD Department reserves the right to consider each leniency request
on a case-by-case manner.



The SSD Department communicates the outcome of the request to the
student within 10 working days of it being received (provided
documentation is received timeously).

Academic Integrity Policy The purpose of the Academic Integrity Policy
is to establish a framework within which to discourage, prevent and
manage plagiarism cases consistently across the South African College of
Applied Psychology (SACAP).

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 84

Plagiarism is a serious form of academic dishonesty. It is academic
misconduct for which a student may be disciplined in terms of SACAP's
Disciplinary Code. This policy should be read in conjunction with the
Student Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Code. SACAP requires students
to act with integrity, to uphold ethical standards and to take
responsibility for the production and presentation of their academic
work.

Scope of Policy To achieve academic integrity, the Academic Integrity
policy includes the following: a. Definition of plagiarism. b.
Informative, educative and preventive mechanisms. c. Outcomes of
plagiarism and academic misconduct.

A. Definition of Plagiarism In an academic setting plagiarism is the use
of someone else's work, hard-copy or electronic, without acknowledging
its source. This includes but is not limited to: 

Words



Images



Ideas



Opinions



Discoveries



Artwork



Music



Designs

All forms of plagiarism can be deliberate, but not all plagiarism is
deliberate and can be unintentional (APA, 2020). However, in academia,
even unintentional plagiarism is plagiarism and considered a serious
offense. The following are examples of plagiarism: 

Direct copying without crediting the source.



Translating without crediting the source.



Paraphrasing someone else's work and not crediting the source.



Piecing together sections of the work of others into a new whole and
passing it off as your own (i.e., not using quotation marks or crediting
the sources).



Allowing another student to copy one's work.



Resubmitting one's own or other's previously graded work.



Collusion (unauthorised collaboration, presenting work as one's own
independent work, when it has been produced in whole or in part in
collusion with other people).



Copying the work of other students with or without their knowledge and
presenting it as your own.



Over-quoting (i.e. using too many direct quotes, even if the sources of
the quotes are credited).

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 85



Ghost-writing, or contract cheating -- making use of professional
agencies in the production of your work or submit material that has been
written on your behalf.



In group work, even if the components of the assessment are divided,
each member of the group is equally responsible for the final assessment
submission. Therefore, if there is plagiarism in the final submission,
all group members share responsibility.

In order to avoid being accused of plagiarism students must ensure that
they make every effort to acknowledge sources fully and appropriately
through in-text citations and references according to the most recent
version of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological
Association. In order to avoid plagiarism, the following should be
adhered to: 

Only hand in your own work.



Indicate precisely and accurately when you have used information
provided by someone else (i.e. referencing must be done in accordance
with APA).



Ensure it is clear to the reader from where all information is sourced.



Personal opinions in assessments still need to be substantiated with the
relevant literature.



Paraphrase the words and ideas of others and reference accordingly.



When necessary, directly quote the words and ideas of others and
reference accordingly.



Efficient time management when researching, writing and referencing in
assessments will help in reducing plagiarism incidents resulting from
rushed work.

SACAP's Academic Integrity Policy aligns with the Publication Manual of
the American Psychological Association (7th ed.) (2020) which states
that: Although many cases of plagiarism are straightforward (e.g.,
passages of text copied from another source without attribution), other
cases are more challenging to evaluate. Usually, using incorrect
citations (e.g., misspelling an author's name, forgetting or mistyping
an element in a reference list entry, or citing a source in the text
that does not have a corresponding reference list entry) is not
considered plagiarism if the error is minor and attributable to an
editorial oversight rather than an intentional attempt to steal
someone's ideas or obfuscate the origin of the information. (p. 255)
Therefore, such instances may be classified as poor academic writing and
will result in a deduction on the final grade for the assessment.

B. Mechanisms in place to prevent plagiarism As an educational
institution, the focus is on teaching and learning. There are a number
of mechanisms in place to prepare students for academic success. This
includes modules in the curriculum on academic and digital literacy, as
well as interventions on APA referencing, academic writing and a
peer-assisted learning programme. Furthermore, all assessments are
automatically submitted through an electronic similarity checker via
MySACAP. All students are able to submit a draft of their assessment
through this similarity checker prior to final submission in order to
self-check and self-correct any instances of similarity. However,
students should not only rely on the similarity checker for instances of
similarity. For example, the similarity checker may not detect
self-plagiarism until final submission. It is recommended that students
submit their assessment drafts through the similarity checker a minimum
of 2 days prior to submission due date.

  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 86

C. Outcomes of Academic Misconduct If a student carelessly or
inadequately cites their sources, the educator will provide feedback and
the student will be penalised in terms of the grade awarded for the
assessment. Minor incidences of inadequate referencing will result in
the student receiving a warning and the student will be required to
attend compulsory academic counselling. If a student commits plagiarism,
the educator will note plagiarism on the student's assessment. Feedback
will be provided on the submission, identifying areas construed as
plagiarism. This feedback will be uploaded onto MySACAP and a grade of
zero will be assigned. Once the Student Support and Development (SSD)
Department has been alerted by the educator, they will investigate and
provide an outcome to the student. SSD can, if needed, consult with the
relevant Head of Teaching and Learning if guidance is needed on making a
decision. Although plagiarism is seen as academic dishonesty, the
College aims to work developmentally with students when applying
penalties. Students in their first term of study may have numerous notes
of plagiarism in their first assessments. These will all be considered
first offences and the same penalty will apply. Incidents of academic
misconduct are accumulative throughout a student's duration of study at
SACAP. Important: 

All incidences of plagiarism will be recorded and documented. The number
of incidences mentioned in the table below refer to ALL incidences in
the student's time at SACAP. Previous offences will be noted
accordingly.



Academic counselling referred to below, may be individual or in a group
setting.



All academic counselling will be arranged via the Student Support and
Development Department.

Outcomes of Academic Misconduct Poor academic writing If a student
carelessly cites their sources, the educator will provide feedback and
the student will be penalised in terms of the grade awarded for the
assessment. If more than 50% of the sources are carelessly cited, the
educator will deduct 10% from the final grade for the assessment and the
student will receive a warning and will be required to attend academic
counselling. Students who exceed the word count stipulated for an
assessment could expect an additional 10% deduction. Open-book
assessments and examinations Plagiarism found in an open-book assessment
or examination is considered cheating and a 0% grade will be allocated.
In such a case, a supplementary exam or reassessment will not be
permitted. NQF 5 1st incident

The student will be provided with the opportunity to resubmit their
assessment for a maximum of 50%. This is on the condition that the
student attends academic counselling. The assessment should not be
graded prior to the educator receiving confirmation that the student has
attended the mandated academic counselling. If student does not attend
academic counselling within the 10 days, they forfeit the option to
resubmit. If they cannot attend for legitimate reasons, they must make
contact with SSD within 10 days.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

The Work Integrated Learning Policy Work Integrated Learning (WIL)
provides students with the opportunity to gain practical experience
within the student's respective field of study. Students will
collaboratively engage with respective organisations or projects within
the field. The WIL module is included in the following undergraduate
qualifications: 

Advanced Certificate in Counselling and Communication Skills (AC)



Diploma in Counselling and Communication Skills (Dip)



Bachelor of Applied Social Science (BAppSocSci)



Bachelor of Social Work (BSW)

WIL Prerequisites (Part 1 and Part 2 where applicable) In order for any
student to enrol for the WIL module, all specified academic requirements
(as per the Rules of Academic Progression Policy) and financial
obligations need to have been met. In the event that a student is in
arrears, they will not be admitted for the WIL placement (WIL Part 2).
Competency must be demonstrated in WIL Part 1 before a student may
proceed into WIL Part 2. Should a student not be deemed ready to enter
the field by the WIL Department, the student may be required to repeat
the preparatory workshops (WIL Part 1). Once a student has been deemed
eligible for WIL Part 2, students need to upload all necessary
documentation on MySACAP portal for their relevant WIL co-ordinator to
access prior to the start of WIL part 2. Any hours completed prior to
the submission of these forms will not be credited.

Timeframes Once the student enters the WIL module, students are required
to complete the preparatory workshops (WIL Part 1) prior to being deemed
eligible for WIL placement (WIL Part 2). Once a student is deemed
competent for WIL placement (WIL Part 2), a student needs to complete
their placement hours within 1 academic term. Should a student need
additional time, a student will need to apply for an extension and a
maximum of 1 additional academic term may be granted. This means that
the student will need to complete all requirements for WIL placement
(WIL Part 2) in a maximum of two consecutive academic terms. Students
completing the Alternative Assessments may only defer for a maximum of 2
academic terms.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 89

WIL Module Extension Rule For students who are unable to commence with
WIL Part 2 directly following WIL Part 1, a maximum of one academic term
may be granted based on the student's written motivation and personal
circumstances warranting an extension. WIL extensions may only be
granted by the Head of WIL. An extension may have a financial
implication should the student have to start a new academic year of
study. Students to be advised that the WIL module (Part 1 and Part 2)
must be completed within a maximum of one academic year (3 consecutive
academic terms). Students who cannot complete a placement due to
unforeseen circumstances must immediately contact the SACAP WIL
Coordinator, who will then assess the situation and determine whether
any hours will be credited towards the placement requirements.

Academic WIL Support Plan Should a student not demonstrate the required
levels of competency expected by SACAP, students may be required to
spend additional time in the field, attend additional supervision and/or
be involved in other additional activities to assist the student to
reach the expected levels of competency. This is at the WIL department's
discretion. Should a student be unsuccessful in passing the module, they
may be required to re-enrol for the module or repeat aspects of the
module, regardless of whether or not this is the student's final module
required for their qualification. WIL students should be aware that
there may be financial implications especially should the student need
to register for a new academic year. It is important to note the
following: 

The WIL module may not be conducted outside of a SACAP approved WIL
placement sites.



No Credit Transfer or Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) exemption will
be granted for the WIL module.



The WIL student's involvement within the WIL placement site is
conditional on meeting the attendance requirements for both individual
and group supervision sessions.



The minimum overall pass grade for the WIL module is 60%.



A student will be eligible for an assessment resubmission should they
receive a final grade of 45 59%.

Attendance All students are required to participate in all WIL
activities as per their module outline. Face to Face and Online Live
students may miss no more than 2 preparatory workshops in WIL 1.
Online-Flexi students may miss no more than 1 live session and would
need to actively participate in all asynchronistic activities (inclusive
of voice-thread activities) in WIL 1. In exceptional circumstances,
students may miss no more than two preparatory workshops in WIL Part 1
and one group supervision session in WIL Part 2. Students who do not
meet the minimum attendance requirements should refer to the attendance
policy. All individual supervision sessions are compulsory and the onus
falls on the students to set up their individual supervision sessions
throughout their WIL Placement. 

Students will be allocated individual and group supervisors by the SACAP
WIL department. Students will not be able to choose or request a
supervisor. Should a student have a particular concern with their
allocated supervisor/s, such students would need to inform their
respective WIL coordinator or Head of WIL with immediate effect.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 90



Students are responsible for scheduling their individual supervision
times one week in advance with their SACAP supervisors and make the
necessary venue booking arrangements with their supervisor and the
College. Should a supervisor request to have the supervision session at
their private practice, this may take place in agreement with both
parties.



SACAP supervision sessions are to take place Monday-Friday during the
hours of 09:00-15:00, unless agreed upon by both the supervisor and
student.



Individual supervision with the SACAP supervisor needs to take place
after every 15-20 placement hours whilst the student is in the field.
Supervision for students that are completing the alternative assessments
for WIL part 2, supervision will take place every alternate week. Should
supervision not take place within this prescribed timeframe, those hours
within the field will not be counted and the student will need to redo
these hours.



Students are responsible for notifying their supervisor 48 hours in
advance should they not be able to attend their individual SACAP
supervision session. Without such prior notification he/she will need to
reschedule the individual SACAP supervision session at the student's
cost.



Students are allocated to group supervision, based on when a particular
student will enter the field. While every effort is made to ensure that
their allocated group runs throughout their time in the field, this is
not always possible, due to the fact that students enter the field at
different times.



A SACAP group session may start running slightly before a student enters
the field or continue beyond a student's completion of their time in the
field. Regardless, students are to attend their allocated groups as
stipulated above.



Group dynamics and confidentiality play a pivotal role in the SACAP
group supervision process. Students are therefore not permitted to move
from their allocated group.

Assessments and Examinations 

At the start of the module (WIL Part 1), students are provided with a
module outline that details the assessment requirements for the module.
In consultation with their educator, students should ensure that they
understand what is expected from them for each assessment, including
their assessment due dates.



In addition to the module outline, students are required to regularly
check (weekly) their MySACAP WIL classrooms for any notifications from
their WIL Coordinator/Educator.



All assessments (including the Oral Presentation) will be submitted
through Unicheck and therefore all rules as per the Plagiarism Policy
will apply to the WIL module.



All rules as per the Assessment and Grading Policy and Examination
Policy apply to the WIL modules.



The Oral Presentation is regarded as a final examination, and as such
all applicable rules as per the Examination Policy will apply.



Students who arrive more than 10 minutes late for their Oral
Presentation will automatically fail this examination.

Student Professional Code of Conduct SACAP provides a secure and
supportive environment for teaching and learning in which students are
stimulated to reach a high level of academic achievement. The College is
committed to high standards of professional and ethical conduct in all
activities, and holds expectations about student responsibilities \*
Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
given situation.

or medical concerns arise before or during engaging in the WIL module.
The College reserves the right to pause or defer the student's
engagement with the WIL module, with conditions which must be adhered to
by the student ahead of re-engaging with the module.



Engage in ethical and non-discriminatory behaviour and values at all
times.



All activities are expected to be carried out honestly, fairly, and
accurately so as to maintain good relations with the allocated
placement.



duty of care in the services offered to clients of the allocated
placement. This duty includes the protection of a client's
confidentiality.



Students may not establish any financial or other arrangements
(e.g. travel, food, favours, gifts, etc.) with clients and/or their
friends/family members during the placement or thereafter.



A student may not receive any form of remuneration or may not barter for
any form of psychosocial services provided.

Any breach of the above code of conduct will result in disciplinary
action. Please note that any misconduct, which constitutes unethical
practice, could result in the student receiving a failing grade,
discounted hours and/or risk suspension or expulsion.

Unsatisfactory/Incompletion of WIL Requirements Unsatisfactory
completion of a student's WIL occurs when a student fails to meet one or
more of the following WIL requirements: 

Fails to complete the WIL hours in the allocated time.



Fails to adhere to the minimum requirements for attendance relating to
class and all supervision.



Fails to satisfy the requirements of the Portfolio of Evidence (PoE).



Fails to submit a completed PoE 24 hrs prior to their final Oral
Presentation.



Fails to obtain the minimum requirement of 60% for their final overall
WIL grade.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 92

BAppSocSci Student Amended Programme BAppSocSci students who completed
the WIL module during a previous SACAP qualification, have the option to
follow the amended version of the BAppSocSci WIL module, provided that
it is within 18 months from WIL Part 1 completion. The onus falls on the
student to acquaint themselves with their respective study plan and to
initiate communication with the respective administrative departments
regarding eligibility for the amended programme. Eligible students who
elect the amended BAppSocSci WIL module, are required to inform the
College and the relevant WIL coordinator at least one academic term
prior to entering into the WIL module. If the student chooses to follow
the amended version of WIL, in lieu of the hours allocated to the
preparatory workshops, 30 hours will be added to their placement time
and they will only need to attend three preparatory sessions.

Requirements for Graduation Students enrolled in courses that have a WIL
component cannot graduate without being signed off by the WIL
Coordinator as having completed all of the WIL requirements. In order to
graduate in the following year, all WIL requirements need to be met and
the PoE completed before the close of campus in December.

Moderation Practices Internal and External Moderation provides quality
assurance systems whereby a student's competence to achieve the intended
learning outcomes of a module or programme can be measured, as well as
to improve the overall quality of the institution's teaching and
learning environment. This policy is intended to provide a platform for
systematic quality assurance monitoring and evaluation processes to
continuously improve the overall quality and delivery of SACAP's
programmes.

Internal Moderation Internal moderation includes all those quality
assurance monitoring and evaluation processes that assess the quality
and delivery of SACAP's teaching and learning within its qualifications.
These processes are managed between the Heads of Teaching and Learning
on each campus as well as the Head of Programmes institutionally. The
Academic Dean evaluates the evidence from the quality assurance
monitoring and evaluation processes and authorises any necessary changes
to be made within the teaching and learning environment at SACAP.

Student Feedback Students are given the opportunity to provide the
College with feedback on their learning experience, educator/online
module facilitator, module material, and campus facilities or MySACAP
online learning environment every term. Student feedback is conducted
online and as such is kept confidential. The educators will be supplied
with a feedback summary for that term, or discuss any specific feedback
to be addressed with an individual educator/online module facilitator.
Student feedback is a valuable opportunity for educators/online module
facilitator to review the impact of the overall delivery/facilitation of
a module. \* Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will
apply in any given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 93

External Moderation External Moderation aims to evaluate a student's
competence to achieve the intended learning outcomes of a module or
programme, as well as to improve the overall quality of a module's study
materials and assessments at exit level. The learning achievements of
students at the exit level of a qualification are externally moderated
by appropriately qualified external academics who have been appointed
according to clear criteria and procedures who conduct their
responsibilities according to clear guidelines. Only exit level modules
in the final year of studies of a given programme are externally
moderated. External moderation is only applicable to NQF level 7
qualifications and above.

Certification and Graduation Policy Certification All certification
arrangements for SACAP's qualifications are taken care of by the
Registrar's Office. Every effort is made to ensure confidentiality and
to reduce the risk of forgery. The following certification procedure is
based on Council on Higher Education (CHE) requirements and
recommendations and follows strict regulatory controls.

1.  Student Record Keeping 

All credentials issued by the SACAP and all student assessment records
are kept according to statutory requirements including assessment
results and appeal records.



Student records are stored and administered in electronic format in a
safe, secure and access controlled database.



Student records are identified by a numbering system, which includes a
unique sequential number for each student, module and course
identification codes.



The Registrar's Office can verify any credentials already issued in
response to enquiries from outside of SACAP.

2.  Academic Transcript An academic transcript is a document issued by
    the SACAP to provide a descriptive record of the learning a student
    has undertaken at the institution (i.e. the list of all modules),
    whether or not a qualification has been awarded. 

An official hard copy academic transcript will be issued to a student on
completion of their full qualification, including a transcript
supplement.



An official encrypted, password protected digital copy of the academic
transcript will be issued to a student on completion of their full
qualification, including a transcript supplement.



Complete or incomplete transcripts will be issued free of charge to
students at qualification exit points, i.e. qualification withdrawal,
qualification transfer, graduation, expulsion, or when the maximum
prescribed qualification completion time has expired and studies have
been terminated.



Re-issuing of transcripts will incur administration costs.

- Please Note: At any point in time the latest policy will apply in any
  given situation.

SACAP Student Handbook 2022 94



Students will be required to pay for an (incomplete) transcript when one
is requested during the natural course of their studies prior to exit.

3.  Official Certificate An official certificate is issued by SACAP to
    acknowledge the learning a student has undertaken at the
    institution. 

An official hard copy Certificate will be issued to a student on
completion of their full qualification at the following graduation
ceremony.



An official encrypted, password protected digital copy of the
Certificate will be issued to a student on completion of their full
qualification.



Student information is taken from SACAP's student database. This
database has limited restricted access. Only relevant SACAP stakeholders
have access to this database.



The academic record of each student is checked once all final grades
have been verified, i.e. at least two weeks before graduation. Should a
student fail, the official certificate is not printed.



The documents with the official certificate design and student
information are safely kept by the Registrar's Office.



The official certificates are authorised by the Academic Dean for
printing two weeks prior to the graduation ceremony.

Graduation To graduate from a course of study is a milestone in any
person's life. It is an opportunity to gather with family, friends and
colleagues to celebrate the realisation of a goal and acknowledge the
commitment and dedication of all involved in the achievement of this
goal. Upon the successful completion of all components of any
qualification, the graduate (regardless of mode of delivery) is invited
to attend the College's Graduation Ceremony held in March/April of each
year. Students receive a College Credential and a College Transcript
that lists the title and grade for each module studied. A letter of
invitation to attend the Graduation Ceremony is forwarded to all
graduates prior to the ceremony. Students intending to graduate in any
given year must have completed all assessments and Work Integrated
Learning Placement requirements the previous year. No student will be
eligible to graduate unless all outstanding library or financial
liabilities due to the College have been settled in full. Students who
have successfully completed and passed all the required modules for a
qualification are asked to complete an Application to Graduate Form by
December of the preceding year to ensure their inclusion in the event.
SACAP reserves the right of admission to this event.
