PREFACE 

![][image3]

THE SYSTEM OF meditation known as Lamrim, stages of the path to enlightenment, was begun by the great eleventh-century saint-scholar Atisha and has been developed over successive generations by Tibetan meditators. It originated with Atisha’s eloquent work in verse appropriately titled *Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment*, in which he condensed the essence of the entire Buddhist training of the mind in the stages of mental development suitable to the trainees of initial, middling, and highest capacity. The great scholar and adept Tsongkhapa based his much admired text *Lamrim Chenmo* (Great Exposition on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment) on this classic work; it explores in great depth the subject matter of Atisha’s *Lamp*. 

As was the original intent of the authors, the beauty of Lamrim lies in its systematic approach to training the mind through meditative contemplation, taking into account the complexity of the human mind. With Lamrim practice, one embarks upon a fresh spiritual journey in uncovering the layers of mists that obscure the human personality. Its approach is simple, rational and yet profound and does not presuppose any knowledge or training on the part of the beginner. The example of many great meditators testifies to the efficacy of the Lamrim system. Beginning with elementary trainings, such as how to adopt a sound and right mental outlook and motivation in one’s life, it leads the practitioner to the profound discovery of the reality, emptiness, that underlies the entire expanse of phenomena. Such an insight brings into question the very basis and validity of many of our strongly held conventional beliefs which are at the root of all our fluctuating emotions, thus showing the discrepancy between the way things are and how we perceive them to be. This revelation, when developed with the bodhisattva motive of universal compassion to work for the benefit of all beings, comes into its perfection in a state beyond duality and conceptuality. It is the state of full enlightenment, where the individual is free of all limitations and has brought his or her human potential to its fullest development, so as to be of limitless service to his or her fellow beings. 

*The Complete Foundation: The Systematic Approach to Training the Mind*  
is a translation, based on an oral teaching of H.H. the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, of Panchen Lobsang Choekyi Gyaltsen’s Lamrim, titled *Path to Bliss Leading to Omniscience*. The teaching was given at the main temple in Dharamsala, India, in the spring of 1988 together with several other discourses. The translation was first done simultaneously at the teaching, and was then later corrected by comparing it to the Tibetan tapes. As the type of commentary given on the text at the discourse was experiential in nature, the tradition requires four repetitions of the main sections of the practices. These repetitions have been incorporated in this book into a single body, thus presenting the entire teaching in an easily readable, yet complete, written form. 

A brief note is owed to the reader on the editing of His Holiness’s original teaching. Being a commentary on the First Panchen Lama’s Lamrim, the original format of His Holiness’ teaching followed the structure of that text in which all the main Lamrim meditations were explained within the framework of the preliminary, main, and concluding practices. However, in this book the format has been altered a little to suit the needs of both readers and practitioners. The book is divided into three parts. Part One comprises a general introduction to the spiritual path of a Buddhist practitioner and the origins of the Lamrim instructions. Part Two deals with the elements of preliminary practices within the framework of the six stages of preparation. It ends with an instruction on activities during the between-session periods and a summary note explaining how to integrate the preliminaries with the main Lamrim meditations. In Part Three, all the main Lamrim meditations are explained by topic so that they can be either studied and practiced in conjunction with the preliminary practices found in the preceding chapters, or reflected upon independently. Since the practice of a bodhisattva’s way of life is a crucial element in the Lamrim path, the procedure of the ceremony through which a bodhisattva trainee commits himself/herself to follow such an ideal is included in Part Three. Other vital materials on the practices of a bodhisattva, such as the bodhisattva vows and precepts of thought transformation practice, are given in appendices. For readers who wish to cross-refer the sections of this book with the original Tibetan version of *The Complete Foundation*, the translation of the outline of the original text is provided in Appendix Three. In conforming to the spirit of His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s personal approach to teaching, a certain style of language has been adopted in this book. Every attempt has been made to keep the language as clear and succinct as possible to convey the spirit of His Holiness’ thoughts without compromising the accuracy of the translation. Notes and a glossary have been prepared to assist readers with the technical terms used in this  
book, and a brief bibliography has been provided for the texts cited in this work. 

We would like to express our deep thanks to Mrs. Joyce Murdoch, who undertook the difficult task of making the initial transcript of the translation from the tapes. Our grateful acknowledgment is also due to Glenn Mullin, who permitted us to quote several verses from his translation of the Lamrim preliminary rite in *Essence of Refined Gold* (Snow Lion, 1983). It is our sincere wish that our humble service in bringing out this book may be of benefit to many and that the noble aspirations of H.H. the Dalai Lama be fulfilled.

PART ONE 

![][image4]INTRODUCTION  
1\. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

![][image5]

ALL LIVING CREATURES possess an innate notion of self based upon the aggregates of body and mind, a self that naturally desires happiness and wishes to avoid suffering. This natural instinct knows no boundaries, and pervades all forms of life in this universe, regardless of the external differences in the physical appearances of these forms. It is this urge that makes all of us hold ourselves most dear and precious. Because this instinct is a just one, the individual has a natural right to work for the achievement of happiness and the overcoming of suffering. 

As mentioned in *Uttaratantra* (Unsurpassed Continuum), all beings further possess the potential to free themselves from the binding chains of suffering and anxiety. The presence of this potential strongly indicates the presence of the Buddha nature or the seed of full enlightenment inherent within all beings. 

The factor that distinguishes humans from other living species is the ability to utilize intelligence while retaining the human qualities of love, kindness, and honesty toward fellow beings. It is vital for people with an appreciation of a deeper dimension of human nature not to let themselves be enslaved by materialism. It is possible to work for one’s livelihood and yet not to stray from sincerity and honesty. Ironically, although the underlying aim of material development is the attainment of more happiness and peace, if one were to lead one’s life totally occupied with material development alone and were to disregard the needs of one’s spiritual life, the fulfillment of this basic aim probably would not be realized. 

It is very obvious to us that the experiences of the mind are far more acute and strong than those of the body. Therefore, if the continuity of the mind remains even after death, then it becomes most essential for us to ponder upon our after-death fate. It is important to probe whether or not it is possible, on the basis of this consciousness, for an individual to achieve a permanent state of peace and happiness. If it is, then it becomes a matter of great personal concern for us to take the initiative to make the necessary efforts to arrive at such a state.  
When we talk of consciousness superficially, it appears as though we were talking about a single entity. But if we analyze deeper we find that there are various types and levels of consciousness. Certain types of consciousness are undesirable in that when they arise they torment the individual’s mind, but there are others whose arisal ushers in calmness and peace. So our task now is to discriminate skillfully between these two categories of consciousness. Generally speaking, consciousness is in the nature of clarity and knowing; it is susceptible to change and transformation. Therefore, the essential nature of consciousness is pure and clear, which suggests that the delusions that pollute the mind have not penetrated into its nature. All the mental stains, such as ignorance and the other delusions that often torment us, are adventitious and hence not indivisible aspects of our minds. Because these delusions, dualistic conceptions and so forth are unstable and reside only temporarily within our consciousness, they can be alleviated and eventually rooted out when their actual opponent forces are applied properly. The achievement of such a feat marks the attainment of a permanent peace and happiness. 

As I often remark, in this world there are many different categories of people: those who adhere to some form of spiritual belief, those who are totally against it, and those who are just indifferent to religion. When people confront situations that defy rational explanation and that are adverse, they differ in their ability to cope with them. As long as those who do not believe in any spiritual system encounter situations that are within the scope of human understanding, they can cope with them. But any circumstances beyond their own understanding come as a shock, and their attempts to deal with them result in frustration and anxiety. A practitioner of *dharma* has a better understanding of life and therefore will not lose courage and hope, factors that are most vital for sustaining the force of life. Therefore, the importance of spiritual development in one’s life is obvious; and in this respect, I believe that the Buddhist doctrine has much to offer. 

There are many different ways of undertaking the practice of dharma; these vary from individual to individual. Some people can totally renounce the worldly way of life and choose the way of a hermit, devoting their entire time and energy to meditation. Others undertake their practice while maintaining a conventional life in the world. One should not have the wrong notion that the practice of dharma is to be put off for the future when one can set aside a specific time for it; rather, it should be integrated into one’s life right now. The essence is to live one’s life within the noble principles of the dharma and give a direction and purpose to one’s life. If one can adopt such an outlook, the dharma will not only be beneficial to oneself as an individual but will also contribute to the betterment of the community in which one lives.  
Generally speaking, altruism is the genuine source of benefit and happiness in this world. Thus if we were born in a realm of existence where the development of altruism was not possible, we would be in a rather hopeless situation, which is fortunately not the case. As human beings we have all the faculties appropriate for spiritual development, among them the most precious of all—the human brain. It is very important that we do not waste the great opportunity afforded by our being human, because time is a phenomenon that is momentary and does not wait. It is the nature of things that they go through a process of change and disintegration. Therefore, it is a matter of utmost importance that we make our human lives meaningful. 

As explained earlier, just as one has a natural right to work for one’s own happiness, so, in equal measure, do all sentient beings. What, then, is the difference between self and others? The only difference is that when one talks of one’s own affairs, no matter how important one might be, one is only concerned with a single person, whereas the affairs of others concern the welfare of numberless living beings. The difference between the two concerns lies in the quantity. 

Moreover, if one were totally unrelated to and independent of others, then one’s indifference toward their welfare would be understandable, but this is not the case. All living beings survive in dependence upon others; even one’s experiences of happiness and suffering come about in relation to one’s interaction with others. One’s dependence on others is not confined to day-to day survival alone; all one’s spiritual development depends upon others as well. It is only in relation to others that one can cultivate such human qualities as universal compassion, love, tolerance, generosity, etc. Even the Buddha’s noble activities come about because there are other sentient beings to work for. If one thinks in such terms, one will find that working for one’s own benefit, totally neglecting the welfare of others, is very selfish and hence unfair. When one compares the welfare of oneself with that of the numberless others, one finds that the welfare of others is far more important; and therefore giving up the benefits accruing to a single person for the sake of numberless others is a just and a righteous act. On the contrary, sacrificing the well-being of many for the benefit of one is not only a most unfair act but also a foolish one. 

At this juncture, when we possess the intelligence to judge between right and wrong and also can draw inspiration from the examples of great *bodhisattvas* of the past, we should make every attempt to reverse our normal self-centered outlook. Our attitudes toward our own welfare should be such that we open ourselves completely to the service of others—so much so, that  
on our part there is not even a slight sense of possessiveness toward our belongings or our being. We have this great opportunity now. We should rejoice in our fortune of having the precious chance, as humans, to practice altruism, a practice that I personally believe is the highest fulfillment of human value. I feel extremely fortunate to be able to speak on the importance and merits of a good heart and altruism. Should we persist in our normal self-centered tendencies and behavior in spite of our human birth, we would be wasting a great opportunity. Our tenure in this world should not be that of a troublemaker in the human community. Therefore, it is very important to realize the preciousness of the present opportunity and that such an opportunity comes about only through the aggregation of many favorable conditions. 

On our part, as practitioners of dharma, it is very important to put the noble principles of the Buddhist doctrine into proper practice within our lives, and thus to experience the real fruits of the dharma. Dharma practitioners should set good examples and demonstrate the true value of the dharma. Otherwise, if our dharma remains only conceptual and is not transformed into experience, its real value may not be realized. 

The essence of dharma practice is to bring about a discipline within the mind, a state of mind free of hatred, lust, and harmful intentions. Hence the entire message of the buddhadharma could be summed up in two succinct statements: “Help others,” and “If you cannot help them, at least do not harm others.” It is a grave error to think that apart from such a disciplining of the physical and mental faculties there is something else called “the practice of dharma.” Various, and in some cases divergent, methods to achieve such an inner discipline have been taught in the scriptures by the Buddha. 

This task of bringing about an inner discipline may look very complex and difficult at the outset, but if we really make the effort, we will see that it is not that complicated. We find ourselves caught in the confusion of all kinds of worldly conceptions and negative emotions and so forth, but if we are able to discover the right key through the practice of dharma, we will be able to unravel this knot of confusion. 

Practitioners of the dharma should have not only the ultimate aim of attaining full enlightenment, but also the goal of becoming righteous and kind-hearted persons within this life too. Let us say that there is a person attending this talk who is normally very short-tempered, but as a result of his listening to the teachings and practicing the instructions he changes; that really is the mark of having benefited from the dharma. The fundamental questions, such as whether there is rebirth or not, and whether or not full  
enlightenment is possible, are difficult to answer. But what is very obvious to us is that a positive state of mind and positive action lead to more happiness and peace, whereas their negative counterparts result in undesirable consequences. Therefore, if as a result of our dharma practice we are able to alleviate our sufferings and experience more happiness, that would in itself be a sufficient fruit to encourage us further in our spiritual pursuits. 

Even if we were not able to attain high spiritual realizations in this lifetime, but were able to develop the altruistic mind of *bodhicitta*—even to a very small degree—we would at least be able to perceive all beings as our closest friends. If, on the other hand, we were to cling to the self-cherishing attitude and the misconception that grasps at the inherent existence of things, there would be no possibility of a genuine and lasting mental peace and happiness, even if all the living beings around us were trying to be friendly toward us. We can observe the truth of this in our daily lives. The more altruism we develop in a day, the more peaceful we find ourselves. Similarly, the more self-centered we remain the more frustrations and trouble we encounter. All these reflections lead us to conclude that a good heart and an altruistic motivation are indeed true sources of happiness and are therefore genuine wish-granting jewels. 

Now we have reached the start of the twenty-first century, an era marked with revolution in many fields of human knowledge. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when revolutionary scientific discoveries were being made, religion and science became more and more separated. Many people felt that they were perhaps incompatible. But in this century, when human intelligence has been so enriched by new knowledge derived through important scientific discoveries, a new trend is fortunately emerging. People in the scientific disciplines are taking a fresh interest in spiritual and moral concepts and are prepared to reappraise their attitudes toward the relevance of spiritual development in order to achieve a more complete view of life and the world. In particular, there is a growing interest among the scientific community in Buddhist philosophical thought. I am optimistic that over the next few decades there will be a great change in our world view both from the material and the spiritual perspectives.  
2\. ORIGIN OF LAMRIM INSTRUCTIONS 

![][image6]

THIS TEACHING ON Lamrim (stages of the path) is one of eight great commentaries on Lamrim. This commentary explains the essential practices of Lamrim and also their preliminaries, in conjunction with the practice of *tantra*; specific parts of the meditations are associated with the tantric visualizations of nectar flowing within the body, and so forth. Among the eight commentaries, this text composed by Panchen Lama Choekyi Gyaltsen, called *Path to Bliss* (*Delam*),1 and also the commentary on it composed by Panchen Palden Yeshi and entitled *The Swift Path* (*Nyurlam*),2 are related to the practice of tantra, whereas the remaining six deal with Lamrim practices purely from a Perfection Vehicle standpoint. 

For the practice of Lamrim, there are two major lineages, both stemming from Buddha Shakyamuni: the lineage of the Profound View transmitted through Manjushri, and the lineage of Vast Practice coming through Maitreya. These two lineages emerged as a result of an elucidation of the dual aspects of the subject matter of the Wisdom Sutras taught by the Buddha himself: the doctrine of emptiness (the explicit subject matter) and the stages of clear realization (the hidden meaning). Manjushri expounded the first and Maitreya the second. 

Atisha integrated the two lineages, and from this integration there later arose the three lineages of the Kadam tradition. In Tibet, Atisha composed the text called *Jhangchup Lamgyi Dronme* (Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment), which served as the basis for many of the subsequent Lamrim treatises that emerged later in Tibet. 

The great Lama Tsongkhapa, having received the three Kadam lineages, composed *Lamrim Chenmo* (The Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path), as well as an intermediate length version of it that omitted much elaboration but devoted special attention to the Two Truths in the section on special insight. He also wrote a very short form, in verse, called *Lamrim Nyamgur* (Songs of Spiritual Experience).  
The Third Dalai Lama, Sonam Gyatso, composed a text called *Lamrim Sershunma* (Essence of Refined Gold), which is in fact a commentary on Lama Tsongkhapa’s shortest version of Lamrim. The Fifth Dalai Lama composed a Lamrim, a commentary on the Third Dalai Lama’s Lamrim, called *Jampel Shalung* (The Sacred Words of Manjushri), and Panchen Lama Choekyi Gyaltsen composed this Lamrim text, *Path to Bliss*. Panchen Palden Yeshi composed *The Swift Path* and then later Dagpo Ngawang Jamphel wrote a Lamrim in verse form. These eight are known as the eight great commentaries on the stages of the path. 

*Path to Bliss* encompasses all the essential points of the sutra and tantra paths and has the advantage of having all the visualizations arranged in a manner conducive to systematic meditation. I know many people who have memorized this entire text and who undertake their practice on the basis of it, thus modeling the whole structure of the path on it. 

I received the transmission of this Lamrim from the late Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche. Since the commentary being given is an experiential commentary, the tradition requires that I give the commentary four times,3 which means three repetitions today and one more tomorrow. 

Regarding the mode of teaching and studying such a text, it is important on the part of the teacher to have pure motivation, to have the altruistic intention to really benefit the disciples, and for the disciples on their part to always relate the teachings to their own minds, to have the altruistic intention to benefit all sentient beings, and to dedicate all the merit of the teaching for the benefit of others. 

On your part, as disciples, you should conduct the appropriate visualizations. These should also be done with the preliminary practices. The preliminaries are explained here in terms of six preparatory practices, *Jorwai Choedrug*, often abbreviated as *Jorchoe*. The six preparatory practices are: (1) cleaning the meditation environment and arranging the images, scriptures, stupas—representations of the body, speech, and mind of the Buddha—in their proper order; (2) beautifully setting up the offerings (which should be free from the taints of being procured through wrong means); (3) sitting on a comfortable meditation cushion in the seven-featured Vairocana posture, and, with the right state of mind, engaging in taking refuge and generating the altruistic motivation; (4) visualizing the merit field; (5) performing the seven limbed practice and mandala offering, an endeavor encompassing all the essentials of purifying negativities and accumulating merit; and (6) beseeching the gurus to infuse one’s mind with their inspirations. 

One could do the preliminaries also on the basis of the guru yoga practice  
of *Lama Choepa*,4 or a shorter version of the guru yoga practice known as *Gaden Lhagyama* (The Hundred Deities of the Joyous Land). It is not the ritual that is important—what is important is that one does the proper visualizations. The point is that you have to perform the visualizations that have been discussed by the teacher during the day. As the guru explains to you, your visualization should not be done in such a way that you have the notion that you are looking at something out there, but rather you should integrate the visualization with your own mind, trying to relate it to the state of your own mind, thus directly effecting some change and discipline within the mind. Undertaking a practice which combines contemplative and absorptive meditations on the basis of such a text and oral commentary constitutes receiving an experiential commentary. So the parts that the teacher covers daily should be visualized every day and the rest of the Lamrim practices could then be just reviewed. One could do that quite easily on the basis of some outlines, which is in fact much easier and also convenient. If you can, you should do that; if not, then there is nothing one can do about it. 

It is important, when you are engaged in these practices, to focus your mind on them and not to let your mind be distracted, even by the arisal of other virtuous thoughts. You should not let your mind be led astray, but should rather channel it on the specific practice in which you are engaging, be it contemplative or absorptive. Letting your mind be distracted by thoughts that are totally unrelated to the practice that you have set out to undertake may actually give you a bad habit of letting your mind stray. So, right at the beginning of the session develop a strong determination that you shall never let your mind deviate from the practice. Furthermore, it is important to stick with the particular meditation that you have set out to undertake. Doing the practice properly, even for a short period of time, is better than spending a long time with all sorts of distractions. The emphasis should be on quality rather than quantity. You should also figure out means to overcome mental sinking and mental excitement, which may also depend on external factors like climate and food. The reason that we have not been able to make any progress at all, even in spite of our being acquainted with dharma for so long, is that we have not been able to focus our minds properly and pay the attention that is needed in such a practice. Therefore, I see the concentration of the mind when doing a practice as very important; if it is done, then there is every possibility that you will be able to undergo changes for the better. 

Sometimes you might feel discouraged. Under such circumstances, it is important to compare your mind, your way of thinking and your actions of ten, fifteen, or twenty years ago with the state of mind you have now. This will enable you to gain encouragement by seeing that you have made some  
progress. You will be able to notice a certain change in your mind: your interest in dharma is stronger, your faith is more firmly rooted, and you lose your temper less often. These are signs of making progress. 

The full title of this text is *A Practical Guide to the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment: A Path to Bliss Leading to Omniscience*. The text is preceded by a salutation to one’s own spiritual master who is seen as inseparable from the Buddha Vajradhara. Buddha Shakyamuni, the master of the sutra vehicle, appears in the aspect of Buddha Vajradhara, the master of tantric teachings. This text deals with all the essential points of both sutra and tantra; the form of the salutation accords also with this fact, because the success of the path, especially that of the tantric path, depends entirely upon receiving initial inspiration from a spiritual master. 

It is very important, just as Lama Tsongkhapa pointed out in *Lamrim Chenmo*, to have proper reliance on a qualified spiritual master, because so much depends upon the master. For this reason, the practice of guru devotion is emphasized to a great degree at the beginning of this text. All the great traditions of Tibetan Buddhism emphasize the importance for serious meditators of having a very special guru devotion practice. When faith and conviction are taken as the basis for any of these practices—whether they be Mahamudra (Great Seal) or Lamrim—one will be able to make great spiritual progress. Many people have told me that they have experienced this for themselves. 

Lord Buddha himself has outlined specific qualifications that a spiritual teacher must possess in relation to the different types of practices, in various scriptures on *vinaya, prajnaparamita*, and tantra. Lama Tsongkhapa, in his *Lamrim Chenmo*, has extensively discussed the qualifications of an ideal spiritual mentor.5 Therefore, practitioners who are seeking a spiritual master have the information needed to judge whether or not the person in whom they are seeking spiritual guidance possesses the appropriate qualities. It is important to rely upon someone who will be able to show you the right path toward enlightenment. Once you have relied upon a master, it is important to maintain a proper reliance, in both thought and action. 

Since this text explains the mode of doing the visualization of the Lamrim in a rather condensed form, the outlines are slightly different from those of *Lamrim Chenmo*. The outline of *Lamrim Chenmo* has four major divisions. These four are: (1) the exceptional qualities of the author, in order to demonstrate the authenticity of the teachings; (2) the exceptional qualities of the teaching, in order to inspire respect for the instructions; (3) the way in which the text possessing the two exceptional qualities should be studied and  
taught; and (4) the stages of leading disciples with the actual instructions. In order for a dharma teaching or text to be considered authentic, its origins should be traceable to the original teachings of the Buddha himself. The instructions on Lamrim have their origin in the prajnaparamita sutras taught by the Buddha. 

The root text of the Lamrim is regarded as being Maitreya’s *Abhisamayalankara* (The Ornament of Clear Realizations), especially the section dealing with what is known as the “serial training” in the sixth chapter of the text. This work categorizes all the various stages of the spiritual journey to full enlightenment by a prospective bodhisattva into four trainings. These four are: (1) training in the complete aspects (*namzog jorwa*); (2) peak training (*tsemoi jorwa*); (3) serial training (*thargyi jorwa*); and (4) momentary training (*kechigmai jorwa*).6 Basically, the summary verses at the end of the *Abhisamayalankara*, where the entire text is summarized into three divisions —the three objects of meditation, the four trainings, and the resultant *kayas* of buddhahood—are taken as the source of Lamrim meditations. There are specific verses also in the fourth chapter of that text where conviction and faith in the spiritual master are emphasized along with conviction in the law of causality. That section also outlines the process of cultivating the altruistic attitude, bodhicitta, and then engaging in the actual deeds, the practices of the six perfections—thus the entire practice of Lamrim. 

There are actually various ways and means of undertaking a practice of dharma, suiting the diverse faculties, interests, and needs of trainees. To study a text, we should take into account the circumstances, the situation, the time, the society, and the community where a book was originally written or a teaching taught. For example, you will see a difference between the style and composition of commentaries and texts authored by the Indian masters and those authored by the Tibetan masters. We find that there are many variations in the styles and techniques adopted by different masters for leading disciples or trainees on the stages of the path. These diversities have a special significance. 

The style and the process of the path as explained in the Lamrim were first initiated by the Indian master Atisha. Although he was Indian, since his text on the stages of the path was composed in Tibet, he took into account the mentality and needs of the Tibetan people and wrote a text that would lead the practitioners through the comprehensive yet condensed practices of the three scopes. Therefore, Lama Tsongkhapa, when commenting on the exceptional qualities of the author at the beginning of his *Lamrim Chenmo*, wrote down the qualifications of Atisha, thus implying that he was the actual author of the  
text. For the Tibetans, Atisha’s kindness is indeed boundless. Since the Gelug tradition later came to be known as the new Kadam tradition, retrospectively Atisha’s tradition came to be known as the old Kadampa. The Kadam tradition that emerged from Atisha and his chief disciple Dromtonpa was really very impressive, very straightforward, practical, and pure in its doctrine. Lama Tsongkhapa’s various versions of Lamrim took Atisha’s *Lamp* as their basis and complemented the section on special insight by adding materials from the major treatises of Indian masters such as Nagarjuna. In these sections, he not only explains the methods of cultivating the two factors of the path—wisdom and method—in a systematic way, but also clarifies many points that were left obscure before his time. Then, as stated above, the First Panchen Lama composed this exceptional text on Lamrim. He was a great being with high realizations, and was totally non-sectarian, a person who was deeply admired by many great personalities of his time. As Lama Tsongkhapa mentioned in his *Lamrim Chenmo*, through the practice of Lamrim one could realize all the teachings of the Buddha as personal advice, see all his teachings as non-contradictory, and easily understand the ultimate intent of the Buddha. Thus, through such practice, the grave misdeed of abandoning the doctrine would be naturally prevented. Hence, one could say that the exceptional qualities of this text are: (1) an encompassing of the entire subject matter of Lamrim; (2) an easy applicability, as the text is composed in a style designed primarily for meditation; and (3) an endowment with the instructions of the two lineages. The text is quite condensed, yet very profound, consisting of all the essential points of Lamrim explained in conjunction with unique tantric visualizations. For an intensive meditation on Lamrim practices it is essential to engage in a preliminary stage of practice, preparing for one’s meditation not only a conducive external environment but also a receptive mind. This can best be undertaken within the framework of what are known as the six preparatory practices.  
PART TWO

PREPARATORY PRACTICES  
3\. CREATING A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT ![][image8]

FIRST, YOU SHOULD seek a proper environment and arrange a comfortable seat, slightly upraised at the rear so that when you do long meditation sessions you will not feel tired. Then, the position of your body should be maintained in the Vairocana posture: your legs crossed, if possible; your spine straight; your head slightly bent and the eyes downcast, looking in front of you; and the tip of the tongue touching the palate of the mouth. You should judge for yourself the best position for your eyes: some people find that doing the meditations with open eyes is much more powerful, whereas others find it very distracting. For them, slightly closing the eyes might prove more beneficial. Generally speaking, I think that visualizations of the deities and so forth, if conducted with the eyes open, will have a greater clarity. Sometimes it may also be beneficial to just sit down facing a wall directly, so that you don’t have any distraction. The point is that you should figure out a way that you find least distracting and that permits you greatest clarity. 

You may find the position uncomfortable. If so, at the beginning of your meditation—just as a symbol, a sign of auspiciousness—try to sit cross legged at least for a while and then later you can adopt leg postures more comfortable for you. 

Place the hands in the position of meditative equipoise, four finger-widths below your navel, the right palm on top of the left, the two thumbs touching each other, forming a triangle there. You should keep your elbows away from your body, slightly outstretched so that air can pass through. Keeping the upper tip of the tongue touching the palate of the mouth may prevent thirst; otherwise, if you just open your mouth, then—as a result of breathing meditations and so forth—you might feel thirsty. 

The most important thing is to have an object appropriate to your meditation. To help you have a better visualization, it is good to have a representation of the deity on whom you are meditating, such as the Buddha Shakyamuni, the master of the doctrine, and to look at it frequently. If you don’t have any representations, that is all right, but if you do have them, they  
should be arranged properly—statues, scriptures, and so forth. I always make the remark that inside Tibet, since the Chinese have meted out great destruction of religious monuments, making statues is quite important, because they can be used to point out to the younger generation that such is the Buddha, and such is Avalokiteshvara, the patron deity of Tibet and the embodiment of compassion, and such is Manjushri, the deity of wisdom, and so on. But here, representations—for a serious practitioner—are not indispensable. Many masters of the past, such as the great meditator Milarepa, achieved high realizations without depending on these external factors. It is important to be able to judge what are the most essential elements. 

Furthermore, I often mention that although there have been very great masters in Tibet who have had high realizations, at the same time there have been many shortcomings in Tibet as well. Even in religious practices worldly considerations have crept in, so it is very important for all practitioners to realize that the practice of dharma means bringing about a discipline within one’s mind—in other words, training the mind. 

Therefore, one should not view one’s dharma practice as being something decorative, regarding statues and images as material possessions or as furnishings for one’s house, or thinking that because there is an empty space on a wall one might as well put up a thangka for decoration. That kind of attitude should not be cultivated. When you arrange the statues or thangkas, you should do so out of a deep respect from the mind, moved by your faith and conviction. If you can arrange these physical representations—statues and so forth—out of deep respect and faith, that’s all right. On the other hand, the attitude that they are merely material possessions is dangerous and destructive. I think that some people who have a cupboard or the like in which they keep all their precious possessions may arrange an altar on it just for the sake of decoration. This is very wrong. 

It is also dangerous to arrange statues of very wrathful *dharmapalas*, or protectors, without also having a statue of Buddha Shakyamuni. One’s attitude in arranging such statues, if it is influenced by worldly considerations, such as thinking that if one propitiates such and such a protector one’s wealth will be increased and so forth, is unsafe. Sometimes I feel it is almost like entrusting these deities on the altar on top of the cupboard to protect the things that are inside the cupboard and perhaps increase them if possible\! Such an outlook is contradictory to the practice of dharma. If the great Kadampa masters such as Dromtonpa were to come in person and see such an arrangement made with such motivation, they would never admire or be  
pleased by it, but would denounce it. I can guarantee such a response. Having such motivations is not the proper way to become a Buddhist; the proper way to become a Buddhist is to bring about some positive change within the mind. Any practice that can give you more courage when you are undergoing a very difficult time and that can provide you with some kind of solace and calmness of mind is a true practice of the dharma. I thought that it would be more beneficial if I explained the disadvantages of arranging the altar in such a manner and with the wrong motivation, than if I explained the advantages of properly arranging an altar. If we were to spend all our energy and time simply on the arrangement of beautiful altars and so forth, totally neglecting the development of the mind, then that would be very bad. 

The environment where you are doing the meditation should be properly cleaned. While cleaning, you should cultivate the motivation that since you are engaged in the task of accumulating great stores of merit by inviting the hosts of buddhas and bodhisattvas to this environment, it is important to have a clean place. You should see that all the external dirt and dust around you is basically a manifestation of the faults and stains within your own mind. You should see that the most important aim is to purge these stains and faults from within your mind. Therefore, as you cleanse the environment, think that you are also purifying your mind. Develop the very strong thought that by cleaning this place you are inviting the host of buddhas and bodhisattvas who are the most supreme merit field, and that you will subsequently engage in a path that will enable you to purge your mind of the stains of delusions. 

Then, if you have a representation of the Buddha’s speech, such as a text on Lamrim, *The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Verses*, or any other texts, it would be good to arrange them properly. Offerings can also be arranged, if you have some—but if you do not have them, they can be done without. When you make offerings, it is important to see that the materials of the offerings have not been wrongly procured. There is nothing to be admired about elaborate offerings if the materials for the offerings are obtained in a wrong way, because the negativities accumulated in the process of procuring such materials will not be offset by the merits gained through offering them. So, such offerings are pointless and foolish. However, a great store of merit can be gained on the basis of making offerings properly.  
4\. PREPARING THE MIND 

![][image9]

ONE’S MOTIVATION AT the beginning is very important, because whether or not one’s practice becomes successful and effective depends upon the initial motive and attitude. For the development of the right attitude, the practice of refuge and the generation of bodhicitta are vital. Through the practice of the two one should be able to bring about some discipline and transformation within one’s mind. 

So, on a comfortable meditation seat you should adopt the right physical posture and then generate the appropriate motivation. After you are seated facing eastward (or imagining that you are facing eastward), reflect that you are very fortunate to have this opportunity to engage in the practice of dharma, and that you will make this session most worthwhile. Rejoice that you have this opportunity, and think that, at this juncture, when you have obtained most of the important conditions for making progress on the path, there is hope that you can embark on the right path and make some spiritual progress. 

It is almost like being at a critical crossroad and taking a new turn in your journey, embarking on a path leading to the achievement of the omniscient state—not for your own sake alone, but rather for the benefit of all living beings. 

Also reflect that you possess within yourself, as do all living beings, the potential or the seed of buddhahood, and also have access to the means by which this potential can be successfully activated. Think: I shall explore this potentiality to its fullest extent, and I shall make the most of the present opportunity. Furthermore, you should reflect upon the fact that you have been extremely fortunate to have received many teachings from the master and that you are equipped with the knowledge to undertake the practice properly. 

You should understand that the whole purpose of listening to teachings, taking teachings, and studying them is to put them into practice, just as after having learned how to prepare a certain dish, you utilize that knowledge to  
make the dish and derive full nutritional benefit from it. What you know should be put into practice immediately; you can thus derive the benefit of having some transformation within your mind. Even though it might be a very minor effort, a very small practice just leaving imprints within your mind, still you must think that it is worthwhile to do. Otherwise, your knowledge of dharma will be quite fruitless, and like merely playing something on a tape. 

At the initial stage it is important to have short sessions, as many of them as possible in a day. Generally speaking, the texts speak of four sessions, two in the morning and two in the afternoon, but you could make it into six. The length and the number of the sessions should be judged according to your own personal disposition. Your practice should be enduring, and you should undertake it with sustained effort. But because at the initial stage much depends upon your physical condition—the body’s influence on the mind is very powerful—you have to take the body’s condition into account. So it is very important to be careful. Some practitioners who put the body to a severe test in their practice of dharma may end up losing it, as such an act is very destructive. 

Once you have made good progress on the spiritual path, you will gradually gain control over your body and mind through meditative stabilization. Particularly when you have gained control over the subtle energies, you will be able to employ your body for any length of time without there being any danger of imbalances being caused by your spiritual practices. This stage is quite difficult to attain; therefore at the initial stage it is very important to be cautious and very skillful. 

I make this remark for the people who are undertaking the practice of dharma very seriously as solitary meditators in the mountains. For you, it is crucial right from the beginning to be skillful and cautious so that you can maintain a sustained effort. If you can undertake such a practice when you are young, you will be able to make great progress, whereas if you start when you are already too old, you may not be able to make much progress. 

You can do the sessions at the initial stage for about half an hour or maybe an hour, depending upon your own conditions, and after that you can end the session and do other practices or take a rest. 

For those of you who are not able to devote all your time to meditation, there is nevertheless the possibility of engaging in practice in a serious way. For example, the students at the monastic universities in South India can, with some effort, do meditations during the prayers. When you recite the prayers, you can mentally do the contemplation. The lifestyle and daily routine at these monasteries have been structured by the great masters of the past in a  
way that is most conducive to individual practice as well as to the flourishing of the dharma. 

If you find that your mind is in a very fluctuating emotional state— displaying anger, hatred, attachment, and so forth—then you should first try to calm down that state of strong emotion. This should be done by first transforming it into a neutral state of mind, because there is no way that one can switch directly from a negative state of mind to a positive one. Therefore, you should first reduce the force of these emotions and fluctuations and try to bring about some sort of calmness, using any means—such as taking a stroll or concentrating on the inhalation and exhalation of the breath—that will enable you to forget what you are immediately feeling. This will help you to reduce the force of strong emotion, thereby giving you the calmness necessary for the practice of dharma. Like a white piece of cloth which could be dyed any color that you desire, such a neutral state of mind could then be transformed into a virtuous state of mind. 

You could also engage in the preliminary practices of performing 100,000 prostrations, recitations of the Vajrasattva mantra, and so forth. When you undertake these practices, you should do them properly, not being only concerned about the number. Many great masters of the past of all traditions have emphasized the importance of these preliminary practices—they will enable you to have a very firm start. If through them you can acquire a fertile mind, then when the seed of meditation is planted, it will readily bear the fruits of realizations. 

Having successfully neutralized the emotional fluctuations within your mind and having restored a reasonable degree of calmness, you should then engage in the practice of taking refuge and generating the altruistic aspiration to attain full enlightenment. Taking refuge in the Three Jewels is the factor that distinguishes one’s practice from that of an erroneous path, and the generation of the altruistic mind makes it superior to the paths aiming at individual liberation. 

**TAKING THE PRELIMINARY REFUGE** 

First of all, visualize the objects of refuge. This should be done by visualizing, above and in front of you in space, your own spiritual master in the aspect of Buddha Shakyamuni. His hands are in the normal position, the left arm in a meditative posture, holding a bowl full of nectar symbolizing victory over death and all forms of obstruction, the right in the gesture of touching the ground, signifying his victory over the divine youth mara.1  
Visualizing one’s own root guru as the object of refuge allows one swiftly to obtain inspiration; visualizing him in the aspect of Buddha Shakyamuni makes such an inspiration more extensive and vast. Thus you should visualize the spiritual teacher in the form of Buddha Shakyamuni, possessing all the major and minor noble marks of the Buddha such as the crown protrusion, in the nature of light, crystal clear, very radiant. This clarity symbolizes the union of the illusory body and Clear Light.2 

The guru is seated in the *vajrasana* cross-legged position. This position of the legs symbolizes the Buddha’s having realized the completely enlightened state through the four vajrasanas (inseparable crossings): the *asanas* of the legs, the channels, the energy winds, and the vital drops. This position further symbolizes invulnerability to any form of obstacle. 

Your spiritual master in the form of Buddha Shakyamuni is seated in the center of a very vast and expansive throne, surrounded by four small thrones, on a variegated lotus and sun and moon disks. In front of him, on a small throne, is your own root guru who is kind to you in all three ways, the guru to whom you feel most close. You should visualize him in his normal appearance, excepting any physical defects he may have. Then visualize him being surrounded by all the gurus from whom you have taken teachings directly. 

I found that some commentaries state that even though your root guru may be a lay person, when you visualize him in the merit field you should see him in the aspect of an ordained bhikshu. 

On Shakyamuni’s left imagine Manjushri surrounded by the lineage masters of the Profound View, on his right Maitreya surrounded by the lineage masters of the Vast Practice, at the rear Vajradhara surrounded by the lineage masters of the Experiential Practice. These lineage masters form what is known as the “five groups of lamas.” 

All of them are surrounded by the meditational deities of the four classes of tantra, bodhisattvas, *arhats*, heroes, heroines, and protectors. There are different ways of visualizing the heroes and heroines: heroes on the right and heroines on the left, or, in some traditions, heroes and heroines in union. 

For us, what is of prime importance at the beginning is to develop a deep conviction in the Three Jewels in general, and in particular, the possibility of achieving dharma, Buddha, and *sangha* within ourselves. If we do not develop this conviction, we will not have a very firm and stable foundation. Without such a conviction, if we complement our practice with various visualizations of dharmapalas, heroes, heroines and so forth, instead of benefiting us, this diversity might actually harm and confuse.  
For this reason it is most important to have a very clear understanding of the Three Jewels. This in turn requires an understanding of the dharma, which requires an understanding of what is called the truth of cessation, which requires a good understanding of profound emptiness. 

So, first of all you should have the deep conviction that cessation of the sufferings and the delusions is possible, and also that it is possible within your mind. True cessation is a state where you have destroyed the delusions at their root so that there remains no potential for their re-emergence. Such a cessation can be realized only through the true paths that penetrate into the nature of reality. 

When you develop this conviction, you will also be able to develop faith in a being who has really mastered cessation, who is the Buddha—a person who has fully accomplished the realization of the dharma. If you contemplate along such lines, you will be able to develop a very deep faith and conviction in Buddha Shakyamuni and see him as an incomparable master. 

What distinguishes Buddhist practitioners from others is the factor of taking refuge. But merely seeking a refuge out of the fear of suffering is not unique to Buddhists; non-Buddhists could also have such a motivation. The unique practice of refuge that Buddhists should have is that of taking refuge in the Buddha out of a deep conviction in his exceptional qualities and realizations. If you think in such terms you will be able to understand Lama Tsongkhapa’s profound praise of Buddha Shakyamuni: “Those who are far from his doctrine always reinforce the illusion of self-existence that they have within themselves, whereas those who follow his guidance will be able to free themselves from such confusions.” 

The conviction that cessation of suffering is possible will furthermore enable you to develop deep faith and conviction in the sangha, the spiritual community that will provide you with companionship on your path. If you develop this proper understanding of the Three Jewels, you will have developed a good understanding of the general framework of the entire Buddhist path. Only then will you be able to understand the particular significance of various visualizations, such as those of meditational deities, heroes, heroines, protectors, bodhisattvas, arhats and so forth, because then you will see the importance of their differing appearances. 

Just as Sakya Pandita said in his *Domsum Rabye* (The Divisions of the Three Vows), unless one develops a good understanding of the Three Jewels, one will not understand the significance of the protectors and so forth. I have a German friend who is quite familiar with the Buddha’s teachings; when she visited monasteries in the Himalayan regions, some people pointed out to her  
that protectors and meditational deities are superior to Buddha Shakyamuni. My friend told me that she didn’t find that assertion to be very convincing. She is right, because if you do not have a proper understanding of the Three Jewels, then when you see all these different images, you will have the notion that they are totally different from, and unrelated to, each other, as though they were inherently existent, thus giving you a misunderstanding of their relationships to each other. 

Therefore, I think that if you base your knowledge of Buddhism on a proper understanding of the Three Jewels, which is a common foundation for Buddhist practice, then your understanding of the meditational deities will be good. Then you will also understand the importance of the different kayas, the various bodies of the Buddha,3 and the importance of the path that has the aspect of union of method and wisdom. Only at that point will you be able to understand the significance and importance of these meditational deities that are the physical manifestation of the union of method and wisdom. Without the proper understanding of the Three Jewels and the general framework of the Buddhist path, if you simply visualize a very impressive and wrathful looking deity, your practice, instead of being beneficial, may turn out to be quite harmful and may increase anger and emotion. 

If you find such complex visualizations quite difficult at the initial stage and disturbing to your main practice of taking refuge and generating the mind of enlightenment (bodhicitta), then a shorter version of visualizing the Three Jewels may be more suitable—that is, visualizing your spiritual master alone, but seeing him as the embodiment of the entire merit field. Visualize him in the aspect of Buddha Shakyamuni and perceive him as the embodiment of the Buddha, dharma, and sangha. This simpler practice is known as the Jewel Embodiment (*Kuntu Norbu Lug*). For some people, the visualization of many different figures in a merit field is more beneficial and effective, but for others the visualization of just a single figure alone, such as the Buddha Shakyamuni or your own spiritual master in the Buddha’s form, may prove more effective and powerful. 

Whether to undertake a very extensive visualization or to use a short and condensed visualization is a matter that you yourself should decide on the basis of your own mental attitude and disposition. The point is, whatever is more beneficial and effective for you should be adopted, since the purpose of all this visualization is to bring about some effect and change and progress within your mind. So, if you can achieve these with a condensed form of visualization, that’s fine, and if you think you need a more elaborate version, choose that.  
If you want to do the practice of taking refuge in a more elaborate way, then—just as you find described in the first chapter of *Abhisamayalankara*— begin by reflecting upon the ultimate nature of all phenomena that makes it possible for them to function on the conventional level. All these phenomena have dual aspects, the ultimate nature which is the empty nature, and then, on the conventional level, their individual appearances and various characteristics such as production, disintegration, and so forth. Reflect on these dual aspects, the Two Truths of phenomena, and then elaborate these Two Truths further and reflect upon the Four Noble Truths. Although all phenomena lack inherent existence, when they appear to us they appear as if they had an inherent nature and existed in and of themselves. It is ignorance that grasps at the belief in the true existence of phenomena and serves as the root cause of all subsequent delusions. Once we realize that ignorant mind states are deceptive and distorted, we will be able to see through their illusions and be able to free ourselves of ignorance, thus enabling us to achieve the state of cessation. 

Generally speaking, when we talk of refuge we are referring to different types of refuge: outer, the practice of refuge that is common to the lesser vehicle; inner, the unique refuge of Mahayana; and secret, the unique refuge of tantra.4 This latter refers to the practice of going for refuge to the meditational deities, heroes, heroines, et al., which also has its own division into outer, inner, and secret refuges. We find that the practice of refuge is very important as well as vast, and that it should conform to the kind of practice we are undertaking. 

Having visualized the objects of refuge, imagine in front of them the scriptures composed by great beings, in the aspects of texts and in their nature created of light. These scriptures should be imagined also as resounding with the sounds of the letters as though they were being read. 

All the objects of the merit field should be seen as looking pleasantly at you. Different commentaries explain the reason for the merit fields gazing at us with pleasure as follows: Although our own states of mind are very weak and inferior, and therefore there are no grounds for the merit fields to be delighted with us, since we are now embarking on a path that will lead us to a spiritual transformation, we imagine that in order to encourage us in our initiative the merit fields gaze at us with delight. This explanation is according to the tradition of the late Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche. Another tradition maintains that the significance of this visualization is that these noble beings display such a gesture in order to give us more courage and determination. On your part, you should cultivate deep respect for and faith in  
the members of the merit field by reflecting on their great qualities and kindness. 

After having visualized the merit fields, reflect upon the fact that you have experienced intense sufferings over infinite lifetimes, and that if you pursue your present state of mind and action, you will continue to torment yourself with sufferings in the cycle of existence. Therefore, right now determine that you shall engage in the practice that will bring about some change, and will undertake this practice of taking refuge in the Buddha, dharma, and sangha as well as in the guru. 

With such reflections, repeat the refuge formula: 

I go for refuge to the Guru. 

I go for refuge to the Buddha. 

I go for refuge to the Dharma. 

I go for refuge to the Sangha. 

While doing this recitation, visualize yourself surrounded by all the mother sentient beings in their human aspect. This is done because human beings possess the highest potential for making spiritual progress. Other masters explain that all these sentient beings, although visualized in the aspect of human beings, should be thought of in the nature of their individual forms of existence and actively undergoing the sufferings of their particular realms. 

When you recite the refuge formula, imagine that you do so in unison with all these sentient beings around you. Imagine that all of you possess the basic factors of fear of the sufferings in this cycle of existence and the conviction that the three objects of refuge have the power and capacity to help free you from this fear. Whether or not your practice of refuge is successful depends upon whether or not you have the right attitude, these basic factors. So, equipped with these two factors—fear of cyclic existence and deep conviction in the three objects of refuge—if you repeat the refuge formula as much as possible, your practice of refuge will be successful. On the other hand, if you are not equipped with the two basic factors, even though you might repeat the refuge formula many times, you won’t make much progress. 

You should also reflect upon the acute sufferings of all the sentient beings around you, the general sufferings of cyclic existence, and the specific sufferings of the individual states of existence. Sentient beings like yourself, human beings, although not actively undergoing the acute sufferings of hell realms and animal realms, are nevertheless in the process of aggregating conditions for such sufferings in the future because they are actively working  
for their own downfall. Therefore, it is only a matter of time until you actually experience such sufferings. By reflecting upon the sufferings of cyclic existence, you should develop fear of them; this should immediately be followed by a deep conviction that the Three Jewels have the power and capacity to relieve you from such sufferings. 

Among the Three Jewels, the actual refuge is the dharma, because it is only by bringing about the realization of dharma within yourself that you will be able to free yourself and relieve yourself from the sufferings of cyclic existence. Therefore, dharma is the actual refuge, and the Buddha is the master who shows you the path leading to realization, and the sangha is the spiritual community that provides you with companionship on your path. Thus, these Three Jewels have the potential and power to relieve you from the cycle of existence, but you should not have the attitude that those who entrust themselves to them are automatically relieved without the need for practical initiative on their own parts. 

So that your taking of refuge accords with your basic ideals as a practitioner of the bodhisattva path, you should complement your practice of refuge with the generation of a deep compassion toward all beings. You should think that not only yourself but all other sentient beings revolve in this cycle of existence fraught with misery and suffering; although they seek happiness and wish to avoid suffering, still they have to undergo this fate, against their wishes. 

So, equipped with these three factors—the fear of cyclic existence, the conviction that the Three Jewels have the power to relieve you, and a genuine sense of compassion for the sufferings of all other sentient beings—then, as a physical expression of your sense of the unbearableness of the sufferings of cyclic existence for yourself and other sentient beings, you should recite the refuge formula. The recitation is an expression of what you feel inside, one that is spontaneous and natural. It is only when you have very strong anxiety and emotion that your cry of anguish comes out spontaneously and naturally. 

It is important that the meaning of the verses should be integrated into your own mind. If you merely recite the verses with a distracted mind, you might accumulate certain virtues of reciting religious teachings, but you will not be able to derive much benefit. 

You should do the repetition with the hands folded, taking refuge in the guru as many times as possible. When you do the repetition, visualize the five groups of gurus, focusing upon them especially and thinking that all the negativities that are committed in relation to these gurus, and particularly the Three Jewels, are being purified. To do this, visualize nectars of five colors  
descending from the bodies of these gurus; the nectars enter your body and purify your mind of all the negativities committed in relation to the Three Jewels and particularly your own spiritual root guru. You receive the inspiration of body, speech, and mind of all the gurus, particularly your own spiritual master. Then imagine that you are now placed under the kind care of the spiritual master. These three visualizations—purifying the negativities, receiving the inspirations from the objects of refuge, and finally being placed under the kind care of these refuges—are vital. 

The three phases of visualization should be done when you take refuge in the Buddha, dharma, and sangha. Generally speaking, you should not have the notion that there is a separate guru from the Buddha. A qualified guru should be a buddha possessing all the great qualities of the Buddha. Therefore, there isn’t any being called *guru* apart from the Three Jewels, particularly in the context of Mahayana practice and especially that of the tantric path, because in all these practices all realizations depend upon receiving the right inspiration from the spiritual master. Particularly in the practice of tantra, one takes vows and pledges from the guru, seeing him as inseparable from the principal deity of a mandala. Therefore, receiving a transmission from a living person becomes an extremely important element in the practice of tantra. This point is demonstrated by the simple fact that although in the Perfection Vehicle practice the bodhicitta vow can be obtained from a representation of the refuge, such as a statue, tantric vows can be received only from a living person. 

Although you do not have the opportunity and fortune to have direct access to Buddha Vajradhara himself, you do have access to the inspiration that comes from him in an uninterrupted lineage. Because it is the guru who transmits this uninterrupted lineage to you, he is the link between you and Vajradhara. Therefore, he is regarded as the only entrance through which you receive the inspirations of the Buddha. Because of the extremely vital role that the guru plays in your spiritual development, a specific refuge is taken in the guru. 

Light rays emanate from the hearts of the spiritual masters of the five groups. Visualize these light rays in the form of straws of light that enter through the crown protrusions of yourself and all sentient beings. Through these flow streams of nectar; thus you purify the negativities that you have committed in relation to the Three Jewels and receive all their inspiration of body, speech, and mind. You should imagine, as a result, that you are placed under the kind care of the Three Jewels and particularly of the spiritual master. This practice of taking refuge should be followed by the generation of  
bodhicitta. 

**PRELIMINARY GENERATION OF BODHICITTA** 

The etymological meaning of the Tibetan term for bodhicitta, *sem kye*, is “to enhance one’s courage or mental attitude.” Therefore, bodhicitta is an altruistic state of mind that aspires to attain the completely enlightened state for the benefit of all other sentient beings. 

In order to generate such a powerful altruistic mind, it is important to focus upon all the sentient beings around you and realize the fact that, like yourself, they have the wish to achieve happiness and avoid suffering. You should think: I can help them fully only when I myself have achieved the completely enlightened state, the noble state that the objects of refuge in front of me have all realized, for the benefit of all sentient beings. 

The actual generation of the altruistic mind is done by reciting the following formula: 

I go for refuge until I am enlightened 

To the Buddha, the Dharma, and the highest Assembly. 

From the virtuous merit that I collect 

By practicing giving and other perfections, 

May I attain Buddhahood 

To be able to benefit all beings. 

Recite this verse three times, seven times, or as many times as possible. While reciting, do the visualization of generating bodhicitta as powerfully as possible, so as to lead you to the conviction that without achieving the completely enlightened state, you will not be able to help all other sentient beings. 

With such a genuine and strong attitude, you should imagine that, due to the force of such generation of the mind, Buddha Shakyamuni in front of you is pleased, and a replica of him emerges, comes to the crown of your head, and dissolves into you through your crown aperture. Your body, speech, and mind become inseparable from those of the Buddha. Then you dissolve into emptiness; at that point meditate on emptiness and from within it arise into Buddha Shakyamuni, sitting on a throne upraised by lions. Imagine that you have achieved the resultant state that you were aspiring to achieve. 

Alternatively, you may imagine replicas—in the form of light rays—of the Three Jewels, particularly your spiritual master, entering through your crown  
and dissolving into you, whereby you yourself dissolve into emptiness. From within emptiness, you arise in the aspect of the enlightened being that you have been seeking, that is, as the Buddha endowed with all his exceptional qualities. Imagine that you have turned yourself into such a being, and then emanate infinite light rays around you to all sentient beings, transforming them into Buddha Shakyamunis. Rejoice, thinking that you have been able to fulfill your aim of working for the benefit of all beings. 

This practice could also be done in conjunction with the visualizations of tantric deity yoga as well. Visualize that due to your intensive practice the gurus are delighted and the force of their appreciation causes them to dissolve into you through your crown aperture. The merging of your guru with you now causes you to gradually dissolve from above and below into the Clear Light of emptiness. This kind of visualization should be performed only by practitioners who have been initiated into tantra. 

At this point it is effective to reflect upon emptiness, thinking, Who is the being that has dissolved into me, and who am I? By contemplating on the five-point analysis5 as outlined in *Tsawa Sherab* (The Root Wisdom) by Nagarjuna, reflect upon the fact that “I” is a mere imputation on the basis of the physical and mental aggregates. There is no inherently existent guru apart from the self, that is a mere label imputed upon his physical and mental aggregates. Therefore, we will find that the spiritual master in whom we entrust ourselves and in whom we take refuge, himself lacks an inherently existent nature. 

Similarly, for we who take refuge in him, there is no inherently existent self in the sense of a self that is the master of the physical and mental aggregates and is totally distinct and separate from them. Thus, you will be able to understand the lack of inherent existence or, in other words, the emptiness of the self. This reflection on emptiness will enable you to dissolve yourself—in imagination—into emptiness, from which you arise into Buddha Shakyamuni as described above. The practice of complementing compassion and love with wisdom realizing emptiness is very effective, particularly the reflection upon the ultimate nature of your own mind and on the fact that the buddha-potential is inherent in all sentient beings—the essential nature of your own mind is pure and never polluted by delusions. Delusion has never penetrated into the core of the essential nature of the mind; therefore, delusions are adventitious. 

**THE FOUR IMMEASURABLES** 

Your generation of bodhicitta, the altruistic aspiration to attain enlightenment  
for the benefit of others, should then be complemented with the practice of the four immeasurables: love, compassion, joy, and equanimity. These are factors that will give great impetus to your realization of the altruistic mind and will also greatly enhance it. 

To do this practice, think that although you are very fortunate to be doing this visualization of turning into a buddha, you do so only in the imagination, and you yourself are still an ordinary being. Then you should try to discover what prevents you from truly becoming a buddha, and you will find that it is that your mind is under the influence of fluctuating emotions toward friends and enemies. In order to overcome these, you should practice love, equanimity, and so forth. 

With such reflections, recite the following three or seven times: 

As much as I wish that all beings be free of partiality such as emotional closeness and distance induced by attachment and hatred, may they abide in equanimity. I, myself, will endeavor to make this become a reality. O Guru-deity, empower me with your inspiring strength to fulfill this aspiration. 

As much as I wish that all beings be endowed with happiness and its causes, may they achieve them. I, myself, will endeavor to make this become a reality. O Guru-deity, empower me with your inspiring strength to fulfill this aspiration. 

As much as I wish that all beings be free of suffering and its causes, may they be relieved of them. I, myself, will endeavor to make this become a reality. O Guru-deity, empower me with your inspiring strength to fulfill this aspiration. 

As much as I wish that all beings never be separated from the excellent joy of favorable migrations and liberation from the cycle of existence, may they achieve this. I, myself, will endeavor to make this become a reality. O Guru-deity, empower me with your inspiring strength to fulfill this aspiration. 

**EXCEPTIONAL BODHICITTA** 

Next, you should generate what is called exceptional bodhicitta, a very strong and powerful form of bodhicitta that cannot be cultivated by practitioners of little courage. Therefore, the practitioners of this Lamrim should have in their generation of bodhicitta a strong sense of urgency, that of working to achieve the completely enlightened state within a short period of time—one lifetime.  
The text uses the phrase “quickly, quickly”; the first *quickly* refers to the achievement of the completely enlightened state within one lifetime, and the second refers to its achievement within three years. However, such a note of anxiety or urgency has its dangers, as it might actually lead to one’s disappointment and discouragement when one doesn’t find any realization as a result of practice, even after a long period of time. 

Say to yourself, “To achieve the completely enlightened state within the shortest time, I shall engage in the profound path of guru deity yoga.” You should develop the conviction that all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and meditational deities are various aspects and appearances of your own guru. You should be able to see your own spiritual master as the embodiment of all the Three Jewels: his mind as the Buddha, his speech as the dharma, and his body as the sangha. In short, you should undertake the practice of such a yoga on the basis of viewing your own mind inseparably from the guru, the Three Jewels, the meditational deity and so forth. So, here the preliminary practice of Lamrim is taken in conjunction with the guru yoga practice of tantra.  
5\. VISUALIZATION OF THE MERIT FIELD 

![][image10]

NOW VISUALIZE IN front of you, as explained during the practice of refuge, your spiritual master above in space in the aspect of Buddha Shakyamuni. In front of him is your master in his normal appearance, surrounded by the gurus from whom you have received teachings directly. On his right are the lineage masters of the Vast Practice, on his left those of the Profound View, and in the rear those of the Experiential Lineage.1 All of these groups are surrounded by meditational deities, buddhas, bodhisattvas, heroes, heroines, and so forth. 

Visualize the crown, throat, heart, navel, and secret regions of all the members of the merit field marked by the syllables OM, AH, HUM, SVA, and HA respectively. These syllables are the seeds of the five dhyani buddhas2 and represent the body, speech, mind, actions, and virtues of all the buddhas. 

Light rays emanate from the syllable HA at the heart of the Guru Buddha Shakyamuni, inviting wisdom beings3identical to the ones you have visualized; a complete set of the merit field invited wisdom beings dissolves into each and every individual figure of the merit field, so that you can perceive each figure of the merit field as an embodiment of the entire refuge. Doing this also enables you to see each of them as a manifestation of your own spiritual master. It is through his kindness and in order to tame us that he has manifested in all these various forms; seeing things this way will help you to develop more faith in your guru. Meditation on a merit field of such a scale has a great significance. 

For some people, however, the Jewel Embodiment practice, visualization of a single spiritual master, one’s own root guru, may be more effective. One could also do the visualization of the merit field as explained in *Lama Choepa* guru yoga practice,4 which is the visualization that one finds in the six preparatory practices. It is meant for practitioners who have received initiation and who undertake this practice in conjunction with highest yoga tantra. Those who have not received any tantric initiations should not do the visualization of the merit field as explained in *Jorchoe Kelsang Dringyen*,  
because in that text the figures of the merit field are generated from the wisdom of bliss and emptiness, and if you have not received any initiation at all and have not cultivated this wisdom within you-even in simulation—it is impossible to borrow that wisdom from the merit field. 

So, do the visualization of the merit field as suits your own mental disposition and then, focused upon it, engage in the practice of accumulating merit. This is done on the basis of the seven-limbed practice.  
6\. SEVEN\-LIMBED PRACTICE 

![][image11]

THE SEVEN PARTS of the practice are encompassed by two practices—the purification of negativities and the enhancing of the store of merit. When you engage in the practice, it is very important to understand that each and every one of the seven limbs1 has its individual purpose and significance, and only with such knowledge can you engage properly in the practice. The seven limbs are: prostration, offering, confession, rejoicing, requesting to turn the wheel of the dharma, entreating not to enter into nirvana, and dedication of merit. 

When you recite the verses of the seven-limbed practice, it is important to fold your palms to demonstrate the physical expression of the prostration. You should not feel embarrassed about folding the hands when reciting the prayers. A sense of shame and embarrassment should accompany only an indulgence in negative actions, when your conscience should be able to guard you well. On the contrary, people often demonstrate feelings of heroism and pleasure when indulging in such actions, which is very sad. 

**VERSES OF THE SEVEN\-LIMBED PRAYER** 

**1\. Prostration** 

To my lama, who embodies all Buddhas 

Who in nature is Vajradhara, and 

Who is the root of the Three Jewels, 

Ah, to my lama I bow down. 

To all-compassionate Buddha Vajradhara, 

To perfect seers Tilopa and Naropa, 

The glorious Dombipa and Atisha: 

To the tantric practice lineage I bow down.  
To Maitreya, Asanga, Vasubandhu, Vimuktisena, 

Paramasena, Vinitasena, Shrikirti, Singhabadra, 

Kusali the Second, and Dharmakirti of the Golden Isles: To the lineage of bodhimind’s vast action I bow down. 

To Manjushri, destroyer of grasping at “is” and “is not,” And to Nagarjuna, Chandrakirti, Vidyakokila the Great, Buddhapalita and the other exalted teachers: 

To the lineage of the profound teachings on emptiness I bow down. 

And I bow to the glorious Atisha, 

Who in the presence of Buddha was Bhadrapala, 

In Tibet was called Dipamkara Atisha 

And now, in Tushita Heaven, as Nam-kha Tri-ma-me, Like a magic jewel works the good of the world. 

And to the feet of the perfect friend and master, 

The Bodhisattva who performed the work of Buddha, A precious source fulfilling the two needs: 

To the feet of the spiritual friend Drom I bow. 

To Lama Tsongkhapa, crown jewel of Tibetan sages, Who was an incarnation of the three Bodhisattvas— Avalokiteshvara, treasure of unapprehendable compassion, Manjushri, lord of the stainless wisdom, 

And Vajrapani, destroyer of Mara’s armies: 

To Tsongkhapa, Lob-sang Drak-pa, I bow down. 

To the lineage Gurus past and present 

Who train us in the mystic lore, 

Teach us the sutras, tantras, commentaries, and oral traditions And bestow initiations and blessings, I bow down. 

Homage to the Guru, embodiment of the Three Jewels: The precious Buddha, a peerless teacher, 

The precious Dharma, a peerless savior, 

And the precious Sangha, a peerless guide.  
To Buddha Shakyamuni, Lord of the Shakyas, Who out of wise compassion was born a prince, Invincible one who crushed the force of evil: To he whose body is a golden mountain I bow down. 

O lions amongst men, 

Buddhas past, present, and future, 

To as many of you as exist in the ten directions, I bow down with body, speech, and mind. 

On waves of strength of this king 

Of praises of exalted, sublime ways, 

With bodies numerous as atoms of the world, I bow down to the Buddhas pervading space. 

On every atom is found a Buddha 

Sitting amidst countless Bodhisattvas. 

In this infinite sphere of mystic beings, 

I gaze with eyes of faith. 

With oceans of every possible sound 

In eulogy of the perfect Buddhas, 

I give voice to their excellent qualities: 

Hail to those passed to bliss. 

**2\. Offerings** 

Garlands of supreme flowers I offer them; And beautiful sounds, supreme parasols, Butter lamps and sacred incense, 

I offer to all Awakened Ones. 

Excellent food, supreme fragrance, 

And a mound of powders as high as Meru I arrange in mystic formation 

And offer to those who have conquered themselves. All these peerless offerings I hold up  
In admiration for those gone to bliss. 

In accord with exalted and sublime ways, 

I prostrate and make offerings to the Buddhas. 

For the practice of confession, which is the third of the seven limbs, it is very important to have the factor of regret; without this factor there is no possibility of purifying the negativities. A proper practice of purification requires four powers—the power of regret, the power of the basis, the actual application of the opponent forces, and the power of resolve. If you have the basic factor of regret, all the other powers will ensue naturally. On the other hand, if you lack the power of regret induced through a proper recognition of negative actions as destructive, then the completion of the other powers is not possible. One’s practice of purification will not be effective, since it will not be heartfelt. The great yogi Milarepa said: “When I examined whether or not confession could purify the negativities, I found that it is regret that cleanses them.” 

In order to generate regret, it is important to see the destructive nature of negative actions and also to understand the law of causality. Causes and effects have a relation between them; in particular, the experiences of suffering and happiness—although having external causes as well—mainly come about due to the state of mind that we have. Based on a disciplined mind, we experience happiness; based on an undisciplined, untamed mind, we undergo suffering. We should think that if we are not able to make any progress from our present state of mind, which always indulges in negative thoughts, there is not much hope for us. So, if we are able to think in such terms, we will be able to really see the destructive nature of negative actions, and also that the store of negative actions that we have is inexhaustible, like a rich person’s bank balance. Without the recognition of the destructive nature of the negative forces, we will never be able to develop the deep factor of regret from the depth of our hearts. 

If we do not engage in a proper practice of dharma, it seems that we may expend all our store of merit in mundane pleasures. It is very important to have this faculty of regret in our practice of purification and confession. 

**3\. Confession** 

Whatever ill deeds I have committed, 

Under the power of desire, anger, and ignorance, 

Through my body, speech, and mind, 

I confess and purify these individually.  
This practice should be followed by the cultivation of admiration and rejoicing in the accumulation of merit by oneself and others. 

**4\. Rejoicing** 

In the merits of all sentient beings, 

Solitary realizers, learners and those beyond learning, 

Buddhas in ten directions and their heirs, 

I rejoice in all their virtues. 

**5\. Requesting to turn the wheel of dhanna** 

O the light of all universes in ten directions, 

Who realized Buddhahood through the stages to enlightenment, I appeal to all of you protectors 

To turn the unsurpassed wheel. 

**6\. Entreating not to enter into Nirvana** 

With folded hands I entreat 

Those intending to enter nirvana 

To live for aeons equal to the atoms on earth, 

For the benefit and happiness of all beings. 

**7\. Dedication** 

Whatever little merit I have accumulated, 

Through prostrating, offering, confessing, 

Rejoicing, requesting, and entreating, 

I dedicate all toward attaining full enlightenment.  
7\. THE THREE ASPIRATIONS 

![][image12]

HAVING ENGAGED IN the preliminary practices of purifying negativities and accumulating merits within the framework of the seven limbs, at this point make a fervent prayer to the members of the merit field for the fulfillment of the three aspirations which encompass the essence of that which a practitioner seeks. The prayer is preceded by the offering of the mandala, signifying the offering of the entire universe to the objects of refuge. 

**MANDALA OFFERING** 

\[Then perform either the long or short versions of the mandala offering:\] 

OM VAJRA BHUMI AH HUM, I lay the powerful golden base; OM VAJRA REKHE AH HUM, circling outside, the iron fence; in the center, the King of Mountains; in the east, the continent Lu-pak po; in the south, Jam-bu-ling; in the west, Ba-lang-jo; in the north, Dra-min-yan; off the east continent are the islands Lu and Lu-pak; off the south are Nga-yab and Nga-yab-zhan; off the west are Yon-dan and Lam-chogdro; off the north are Dra-min 

yan and Dra-minyan-kyi-da. 

(Above this I place) the jewel mountain, the wish-yielding tree, the magical cow, the untouched harvest, the precious wheel, the precious jewel, the precious queen, the precious minister, the precious elephant, the precious horse, the precious general, the vase filled with a great treasure, and the goddesses of beauty, garlands, song, dance, flowers, incense, light, and perfume. And I place the sun, the moon, a jeweled umbrella, the banner symbolizing total victory, and at the center the best things of men and gods. 

All this I hold up and offer to all the holy teachers—my kind root guru and all the gurus of the lineage—and also to Lama  
Tsongkhapa, who is both Buddha Shakyamuni and Buddha Vajradhara, as well as to the myriads of deities and retinues. For the sake of living beings accept it with compassion and, having enjoyed it, bestow your transforming powers. 

Earth blessed with flowers, incense, and scented water 

And adorned with the King of Mountains, the four continents, and the sun and moon, 

I offer to this field of Awakened Beings. 

May all beings enjoy this pure sphere. 

The body, speech, and mind of both myself and others, 

Our possessions, and masses of goodness of the past, present, and future, 

And the precious mandala of the King of Mountains and so forth, Together with Samantabhadra’s peerless offerings, 

I mentally claim and offer as a mandala to the lamas, 

Yidams, and the Three Precious Jewels; 

Out of compassion please accept them 

And bestow upon me your transforming powers. 

IDAM GURU RATNA MANDALAKAM NIRYATA YAMI 

Generally speaking, in a practice of offering related to a tantric practice such as *Lama Choepa*, there are different types of offering: outer offerings, associated with the vase initiation; inner offerings, associated with the secret initiation; secret offerings, associated with the wisdom-knowledge initiation; and suchness offerings, associated with the word initiation. The same is true of the mandala offering—there are outer, inner, secret, and suchness mandala offerings. 

The internal mandala is the offering of your own physical body, visualizing specific parts of the body as specific parts of the universe. 

Perceiving all of them as manifestations of the union of bliss and emptiness, and also seeing them as the mere sport and manifestation of the subtle wind (energy) and mind is the suchness mandala offering. 

When you make the outer mandala offering, you can do the visualizations of the universe as described in the mandala formula. But that does not mean that you have to accept that the universe exists in such a manner, with Mount Meru, the four continents, and so forth. It is always important when studying  
a text to take into account the time, the community, and the mentality of the people when the particular text was written or taught. Ancient Buddhist treatises describe the universe in conformity with the popular theory of the universe current at that time. Consequently, the descriptions differ from those found in modern cosmology. 

The point is to offer the entire universe—your own possessions and also things that do not belong to you. Doing this signifies the overcoming of even a subtle form of possessiveness and attachment, but does not mean that we have to accept that the universe system exists as explained in the Abhidharma texts. After all, the basic approach of the Buddhist is to subject concepts to rigorous logical processes, and if anything contradicts direct observation and logic, it should not be accepted just because it is taught in the sutras or the texts. The earth of scientific experimentation and observation—its size and relative position in the solar system—is the earth that we live in, and its appearance is common to the beings living in this world. I think that the scientific observations on this matter are beyond dispute and have to be taken as the truth; otherwise, there is a danger of causing misunderstanding in others who, because of not understanding the profound philosophy of Buddhism, might despise it for certain of its views on cosmology. 

**PRAYER OF THE THREE ASPIRATIONS** 

Next, make a prayer that may you, not only in this lifetime but also always in future lifetimes, never be separated from the kind care of a spiritual master. Also, request—with the three great aspirations, as one finds in *Lamrim Chenmo*—the spiritual masters to help free you from all the obstacles that hinder you from achieving high realizations. The three great aspirations are: 

May all deluded views, ranging from not being respectful to the gurus to the subtle forms of duality, cease; 

May all the positive states of mind, ranging from being respectful to the gurus to the final achievement of union, be realized within; and 

May all external and internal obstacles to the realization of these two aspirations be overcome. 

These aspirations include and encompass all the aspirations of a spiritual practitioner: to be free of all the obstacles and to obtain all the factors necessary for the realizations. There is nothing more that a practitioner could seek.  
8\. INVOKING THE INSPIRING POWER OF THE LINEAGE ![][image13]

O eyes through whom the vast scriptures are seen, 

Supreme doors for the fortunate who would cross over to spiritual freedom, 

Illuminators whose wise means vibrate with compassion: 

To the entire line of mystic friends I pray. 

While reciting prayers to the lineage gurus of the Lamrim practice, visualize nectar descending from the individual figures, and imagine that you receive the inspiration of the particular masters which purifies any negativities committed in relation to them, thus enhancing your mind’s receptivity to the realization of the path. You should then visualize a duplicate of your spiritual master descending to your crown; request the buddhas and bodhisattvas to shower their blessings and inspiration on you because, induced by a genuine desire to practice Lamrim from within, you are now embarking upon a proper spiritual path. 

When you recite the verses making requests to these figures, repeat the last line of each verse. During the first recitation, visualize nectars flowing from the particular masters of the lineage, and during the second, visualize a replica of the individual figures dissolving into you. 

Then imagine that your mind is made receptive to the realization of the specific practices of the Lamrim—for example, proper reliance on a spiritual master, and the recognition of the importance of human birth. Think that you and all other sentient beings have actually achieved the realizations. At this point you could also perform the visualization of the protectors expelling obstacles and providing you with favorable conditions for your practice.  
9\. REVIEWING THE STAGES OF THE PATH ![][image14]

Following a kind master, foundation of all perfections, Is the very root and basis of the path. 

Empower me to see this clearly 

And to make every effort to follow him well. 

Precious human life gained but once 

Has great potential but is easily lost. 

Empower me to remember this constantly 

And to think day and night of taking its essence. 

I must remember that death is quick to strike, 

For spirit quivers in flesh like a bubble in water; And after death one’s good and evil deeds 

Trail after one like the shadow trails the body. 

Understanding that this most certainly is true, 

May I discard every level of wrong 

And generate an infinite mass of goodness; 

Empower me to be thus continually aware. 

Sensual gluttony is a gate to suffering 

And is not worthy of a lucid mind. 

Empower me to realize the shortcomings of samsara And to give birth to the great wish for blissful freedom. 

And empower me that with mindfulness and alertness Born from thoughts ultimately pure, 

I may live in accord with the holy dharma, 

The ways leading to personal liberation.  
Just as I myself have fallen into samsara’s waters 

So have all other sentient beings. 

Empower me to see this and really to practice 

Bodhimind, that carries the weight of freeing them. 

Yet without habituation to the three spiritual disciplines, Thought-training accomplishes no enlightenment. 

Empower me to know this deeply, and intensely to train In the various ways of the great bodhisattvas. 

And empower me to pacify distorted mental wanderings And to decipher the ultimate meaning in life, 

That I may give birth within my mindstream 

To the path combining concentration and vision. 

He who trains in these common Mahayana practices Becomes a vessel worthy of the Supreme Vehicle, Vajrayana. Empower me that I may quickly and easily 

Arrive at that portal of fortunate beings. 

The foundation of what then produces the two powers Is the guarding of the pledges and commitments of tantric initiation. Bless me so that I may have uncontrived knowledge of this And guard my disciplines as I do my very life. 

Bless me so that I may gain realization of the main practices Of the two stages of Vajrayana, essence of the tantric path; And, by sitting relentlessly in four daily sessions of yoga, Actualize just what the sages have taught. 

Empower me that the masters who have unfolded the sublime path within me 

And the spiritual friends who have inspired me may live long; And that the myriads of inner and outer interferences Be completely and utterly calmed forever. 

In all future lives may I never be parted  
From the perfect lamas or the pure ways of dharma. 

May I gain every experience of the paths and stages 

And quickly attain the stage of Holder of Diamond Knowledge. 

While reciting the above verses entitled *Yonten Shigyurma* (Foundation of All Perfections) mentally review all the stages of the spiritual path. At the end, make fervent aspirations that, should death seize you before you have achieved high realizations, you may be reborn as a human endowed with leisure and fortune so that you can continue the journey along the Lamrim path leading to complete enlightenment in future lives. Thus dedicate your merit to the fulfillment of this aim and that of being able to work for the benefit of all beings.  
10\. DISSOLUTION OF THE MERIT FIELD 

![][image15]

HAVING BESEECHED THE merit field for fulfillment of the three aspirations, you should start the process of the dissolution of the merit field, as the preparatory practices are now coming to their end. 

The process begins with an exclusive request to your root spiritual guru made in conjunction with the recitation of the following verse: 

O, my glorious and precious root guru, 

Reside at my crown on a lotus seat, 

And sustain me with great kindness, 

By bestowing the attainments of your body, speech, and mind. 

If you have visualized the elaborate version of the merit field, now imagine that light rays emanate from the heart of Shakyamuni Buddha and touch all the members of the merit field surrounding him. They melt into light and gradually dissolve into the lineage masters of the Vast Practice and the Profound View, which in turn dissolve respectively into Maitreya and Manjushri. Similarly, the masters of the Experiential Lineage dissolve into Vajradhara, and the host of gurus from whom you have received teachings in person dissolve into your personal root guru. At this point you should reaffirm your visualization of the five figures. After a while, visualize Maitreya and Manjushri dissolving into the central figure while their thrones and cushions dissolve into those of Buddha Shakyamuni. Eventually, your own root guru melts into light and dissolves into Buddha Shakyamuni’s heart. Vajradhara, progressively diminishing in size, enters through Buddha Shakyamuni’s crown and remains within his heart as a wisdom being. Cultivate a clear visualization at this point of Buddha Shakyamuni, who eventually dissolves into your personal root guru seated at your crown. Your root guru is in the aspect of Buddha Shakyamuni, possessing all the qualities of a completely enlightened being. 

Then, focusing upon your root guru at your crown, make a single-pointed  
request from the depths of your heart. Together with all the sentient beings around you, make request prayers to the spiritual master, seeing him from the depths of your heart as the embodiment of all the objects of refuge. Perceive the spiritual master as the embodiment of the dharmakaya, all the bodies of the Buddha, meditational deities, heroes, heroines, and so forth. Do this until you feel some effect within your mind; at that point it is effective to examine the nature of the mind which feels that experience. 

Say to the master that he alone is the embodiment of all refuges and that you entrust yourself completely to his care and request his inspiration. 

**Single-Pointed Prayer** 

I beseech you, Buddha Vajradhara, 

The exalted guru deity embodying the four kayas. 

I beseech you, Buddha Vajradhara, 

The exalted guru deity embodying the unobscured dharmakaya. I beseech you, Buddha Vajradhara,

While reciting these verses pray fervently and imagine that, because the guru is pleased with you, nectar descends from his body and enters through your crown. This purifies all the negativities that you have committed in connection with him, and the inspiration you receive empowers you to achieve all the high realizations on the path. With that, the practices preliminary to the practice of proper reliance on a spiritual master are over. 

Just as in a sadhana of tantric meditation there is a point where one does the meditations on subtle and coarse generation stage practices, similarly it is at this point that one undertakes the actual practices of Lamrim meditation.  
11\. ACTIVITIES OF THE BETWEEN\-SESSION PERIODS 

AT THE END of the session, take a little rest. Sometimes when you are resting, you may have inspiration all of a sudden, which helps you see things that you have never seen before. 

Although in the after-session periods you are not engaged in formal meditation, you should keep your mind deep down still focused on the practice so that the warmth of the session is not lost. Then, when you resume your second session you will be able to conduct it successfully, thus enabling you to build on the progress you have made in the first session. Otherwise, if you let yourself stray and be idle during the between-session periods, whatever progress you may have made in the first session will be totally lost, and then in the second session you will have to start right from the beginning. The state is analogous to a hearth in which you do not extinguish the fire totally, so that when you rekindle the fire you will be able to do so quite easily and quickly. It is also helpful to read texts related to your practice. 

When you wake up in the morning, you should bless your speech with certain mantras and develop a strong determination that you will use the twenty-four hours of the day for a worthy purpose and shall not waste even a single moment of the day. With such determination and motivation at the beginning, do any practices that you undertake, such as guru yoga, and then engage in the practice of Lamrim. 

If you live your life in such a manner you will be able to make progress, whereas if you just give up right from the beginning and feel discouraged, then there is not much you can hope for. Therefore, it is very important to have courage and determination. The same is true for lay people: Although you have to be concerned about your profession, livelihood, and so forth, nevertheless, at the beginning of the day wheh you first wake up, it is important to develop the firm determination that you shall live the day properly, in a righteous manner, and not deceive others, tell lies, and so forth. Tibetans, for example, should make the determination that during the day, if they are not able to make any contribution to the Tibetan cause, at least they  
will not degrade the Tibetan name or be a disgrace to it. Those Tibetans who hold me dear should determine that at least they will think about the Dalai Lama, and not be deceptive to him. 

Therefore, monks, lay people, and all of you, it is possible to live a life properly within the dharma, right from the beginning of the day adopting the right attitude and determination, putting all that you know about dharma into practice, with a plan that the things you are not able to practice right now, you will practice next year or in the future. In such a manner you will be able to make progress. 

At the end of the day when you go to bed, before going to sleep you should check on the nature of the activities in which you engaged during the day. If you find that any negative actions have been performed, you should generate regret and resolve that you will never indulge in them in the future. If you find that you have engaged in some positive actions, you should rejoice. 

Also, when going to bed, it is important that you do so with a virtuous thought, because sometimes it is possible for a practitioner to have certain practices in dreams, too; this will be particularly important for the morning, when you are waking up, because in the morning you have a very clear, fresh mind and therefore, when you engage in a practice at that time, it will be more powerful and clear. 

Those meditators who are up in caves should be careful not to meet just anybody, because such a meeting may hinder their progress. Even the mere indication of a stranger coming may hinder your practices; therefore, be cautious. 

This is how you should meditate and undertake the practice of dharma. If you are able to undertake the practice in such a manner, irrespective of whether you recite many texts or not, you will be able to make real progress. Then there is a hope that you will be able to achieve enlightenment in this lifetime, or, if not, in the intermediate state, or in a future lifetime.  
12\. SUMMARY 

ALL THE STAGES of the preliminary practices as explained in the last two chapters within the framework of what are called the six preparatory practices are common to all the topics of Lamrim meditation and therefore precede every meditative session. These stages prepare not only the physical environment where the meditation is undertaken but most importantly the practitioner’s mind, making it receptive to the spiritual change that he or she is likely to go through in the meditative process. As you can notice, the preliminary practices discussed here are based on the standard preliminary rite text *Jorchoe* (Six Preparatory Practices), and the visualizations involved are explained rather extensively. However, as you progress along the path of meditation, and depending upon the length of time you have, you could spend less time with the preliminary practices. Such a shorter session could be undertaken based on just a single verse on each of the important elements of the practice, for example, seven limbs, refuge, generation of the altruistic motive, mandala offering, request to the lineage masters, dedication, etc. 

Having prepared yourself through such a preliminary process you should then engage in the main meditation. In the case of every meditation topic of Lamrim—for example, the proper reliance on a spiritual teacher—the actual meditation is done right after the dissolution of the merit field. At that point all the members of the merit field are already dissolved into the principal figure of the merit field, which is your own root guru in the form of Buddha Shakyamuni. Your root guru also goes through a progressive diminution in size, eventually becoming the size of a thumb. He then descends to your crown where he is visualized as being seated facing the same direction as you are. While focusing single-pointedly on your guru at your crown, make fervent requests to him. Meditatively imagine that, by the force of your prayer request, nectars and light rays flow from your guru’s body, fill your entire body and cleanse the physical and mental stains that obstruct you from attaining the realization of a proper reliance on a spiritual teacher. Imagine that your mind is made receptive to such an experience. You can now begin  
your meditation on the actual chosen topic. 

In conclusion, again visualize that light rays and nectars descend from the guru’s body and fill your body, thus infusing your entire being with his inspiring power. Your meditative session should then be ended with a dedication of all the positive energy that you have accumulated from this particular session toward the happiness of all living beings. The between session practices recommended in the case of guru devotion meditation are appropriate for all the subsequent meditations as well.  
PART THREE 

MAIN LAMRIM MEDITATIONS  
13\. RELIANCE ON A SPIRITUAL TEACHER 

YOU SHOULD THINK now that the reason that you and all other sentient beings revolve in the cycle of existence and undergo all these undesirable sufferings and so forth, is that you and they lack realization of the proper relation to a spiritual master. Therefore, request the spiritual masters to give the inspiration to make you overcome obstacles that hinder you from realizing this path. 

The actual practice of proper reliance on a spiritual teacher is divided into two: reliance through thought and reliance through action. 

**RELIANCE THROUGH THOUGHT** 

*Cultivating Faith and Conviction* 

First, you should visualize your spiritual master at your crown. The spiritual master is the embodiment of all the buddhas. From his heart light rays emanate and in front of him are all the gurus from whom you have received teachings directly. 

Visualize all of them in their normal appearance, with all their physical and personality defects, if they have any. To visualize them with all their seeming faults and defects is important at this point, since you are now engaged in a specific meditation on guru devotion which involves—to a great extent—the means to overcome your perception of faults in them. 

Then, reflect upon the great benefits of proper reliance on a spiritual master —the eight benefits1 as outlined in the Lamrim, such as getting closer to the achievement of buddhahood. By referring to authentic scriptural sources, by employing all sorts of reasonings most suitable to your mind, by considering examples from the lives of the past masters—that is, by employing any means at your disposal—you should be able to see the great benefits of relying on a spiritual master. It is a very profitable venture\! 

Therefore, develop the conviction that you should properly rely on him or  
her. Rejoice in the fact that you have such an opportunity. You should not have the notion that “spiritual master” only refers to high lamas who give teachings from high thrones; rather, the reference is to the spiritual master to whom you relate daily, who leads you on the spiritual path step by step. The kindness of such a guru is the greatest. 

Your faith should be reasoned faith, not just blind faith, based on proper intelligence so that when people question and attempt to refute your belief and practice, you will be able to withstand their arguments. Therefore, your faith should be properly based on a firm foundation. If you have this faculty of intelligence, you will be invulnerable to arguments. Otherwise, as the Kadampa masters say, “Faith alone is like a blind person, and it can be led anywhere by anyone if it lacks the complementary factor of wisdom.” So the faith that is supported by the factor of wisdom, and likewise the compassion that is supported by wisdom, is indispensable in a Buddhist practice, whereas faith and compassion alone are common features of all major religions. Therefore, if you cultivate a faith based on a proper foundation, it will be rational and therefore very stable. 

The second step is to think about the disadvantages of not relating to a spiritual master and then, weighing the disadvantages and advantages of relating and not relating to a master, decide that you shall relate to a master. As Lama Tsongkhapa advised in *Lamrim Chenmo*, first it is important to apply all sorts of contemplations; as a conclusion you should develop a deep conviction and make the determination that you must now definitely rely on a spiritual teacher. 

Furthermore, seeing that through such a reliance you stand to gain, and that without it you stand to lose, pray that you may have an opportunity for such a reliance in all future lives as well. Think: I wish never to lack the guidance of a qualified master in my future lives; therefore, I decide today to rely on a spiritual master right here and now. That is the decision you have to make. 

Reflect now, as a third step, upon the disadvantages and harm of having a breach in your guru devotion practice.2 You will have all sorts of adverse circumstances within this lifetime, and the damage they will cause for your future lives will be great. Therefore, after seeing the harm and disadvantages of having such a breach, you should decide that you will never permit it to occur. Regarding this, it might be helpful to reflect upon stories of the great masters, such as those describing how Naropa in India related to his master Tilopa and how Milarepa in Tibet underwent hardships in fulfilling the wishes of his spiritual teachers and never had any breach in his practice. Having decided that you will rely on a spiritual master, you should determine never to  
make a breach in your relationship. 

The actual process of relying on the guru through thought includes, first, cultivating faith in the spiritual master. For this, while focusing on the spiritual masters in front of you, think that the reason that all the spiritual masters appear to you as though they were ordinary beings is that you have an inferior state of mind and are not able to see them in their own nature as true buddhas. 

There are scriptural sources in which Buddha Vajradhara himself says that in future times he will take the form of spiritual masters. Think that it is because of his great kindness that Buddha Vajradhara has assumed the forms of ordinary beings as spiritual masters, in order to suit the practitioners like yourself who have no faculty to see the buddhas directly in their natural aspect. 

A Tibetan master said: “If you understand, not just in mere words, the way in which buddhas and bodhisattvas of the past help the beings of the present age, you will see it comes down to the qualified gurus.” Therefore, the kindest spiritual master is the one who gives you teachings, because he is the one who leads you to the achievement of enlightenment. If the buddhas are working for the benefit of us at all, it is only through the gurus. So, if you think along such lines, you will be able to generate deep faith in the spiritual master. 

Approaching the topic from a different angle, you should reflect that although the spiritual masters are, in fact, true buddhas, their not appearing to us as such is due to our own ignorance. At this point, it is helpful to reflect that Asanga saw his master Maitreya in the form of a dog, and that Maitripa saw his guru Savaripa as an ordinary hunter, and that Legpa Karma saw the Buddha as having all sorts of faults. Think that it is because of your ignorant mind that you are not able to see spiritual masters as true buddhas. Perceptions in general are deceptive. You can conclude that since your own perception is unreliable, you will never generate even a single thought of perceiving fault in the master. 

Reflect that there must be manifestations of the Buddha who are actively working for your benefit; if there are such beings, they are probably your spiritual masters. But then the thought might arise that you see all sorts of faults in them. Analyze whether this perception is illusory or not: if they are true buddhas, how can they have faults? It is only your own perception that is unreliable. 

As the Panchen Lama says here, the appearance of these faults is not because your spiritual masters have faults, but rather because they are using skillful means by portraying such faults in order to show themselves as  
ordinary beings so that you can relate to them more easily. 

How can we ordinary beings, whose minds are always under the influence of ignorance, determine what is true and what is false with great certainty? Our judgments, even concerning ordinary things, are frequently clouded by our emotions. For example, we often see the actions of our loved ones—even if they are harmful—as wonderful, whereas we judge even the positive actions of a person we dislike as pretentious and false. We cannot rely upon our own perceptions; it is a fact that we misapprehend many situations. If this is a general fact, how can we still stubbornly maintain that our perceptions about our own spiritual masters must be true? 

Sometimes it is effective to take as the central figure of the merit field the spiritual master to whom you feel most distant and in whom you feel you see faults. You can also visualize this master, in whom you find it most difficult to develop faith, as the wisdom being at the heart of Buddha Shakyamuni. Then reflect upon his qualities—his body, personality, and so forth. This practice will actually help you to overcome perceptions of faults in all spiritual masters. It is very difficult to perceive all spiritual masters as true buddhas, but it is possible to overcome perceptions of faults. If you were to suspend your practices until you could see all the masters as buddhas, it would be a long wait until you could commence your practices. Overcoming the perception of faults lays a good foundation within your mind for other practices such as refuge, renunciation, and so forth, and the progress you make in these practices will increase your faith in spiritual masters. So, the point that is most indispensable at the initial stage is the overcoming of misconceptions about faults in the spiritual master. 

Without your masters’ proper guidance, how can you have the knowledge of the paths, let alone embark upon the right one? That you have the knowledge to embark upon a spiritual path and to discriminate between right and wrong is due to the Buddha’s kindness in appearing in an ordinary form to teach you. Therefore, you all should reflect that the little understanding that you have about the stages of the path, and the little practice that you can do with the hope of planting some seed in your minds, is due to the kindness of the spiritual master. Without the guidance of the gurus you might be able to read some texts, but integrating the teachings with your own minds through proper instruction is possible only by following the advice of a teacher. It is only through his kindness that you will be able to accomplish such a feat. 

By thinking in such terms, you will find that the kindness of a spiritual master is great, and greater still is his appearing in the present form so that you can have direct access to him. For example, if a person who has very high  
rank comes with his guards displaying all the grandeur of his position to help someone who is very sick and bereaved, it may not be very helpful; on the other hand, if he comes as an ordinary person, without any servants and so forth, he can be more helpful to the troubled person and may deeply touch the patient’s mind. Similarly, the appearance of the buddhas in their *sambhogakaya* (enjoyment body) form may not be as beneficial to you as their appearance in the form of spiritual masters. The buddhas in their sambhogakaya form are accessible only to bodhisattvas on high levels. 

So you should realize that through the great kindness of the spiritual master, at this time of degeneration still the buddhas are able to portray themselves to you in a physical form and help you according to your own disposition. It is almost like they are protecting those who are abandoned by all other refuges. When you think in such terms, you will really begin to appreciate the great kindness of the spiritual masters, which surpasses the kindness of all others. Such forms of reflection will enable you to actually see the perception of faults in the guru as helpful for increasing faith in his skillful means. Thinking in such terms will increase faith and respect in the guru. So that is how you cultivate faith and conviction in the spiritual master. 

Without faith, even though you might have a very clear visualization and image of the spiritual master, it will not be very effective—it is almost like having a clear image of a good painting. So, develop single-pointed faith and respect for the spiritual master. Such a faith in the guru, firmly based on the realization of him as a true Buddha, can come about only when you have first developed a general understanding of the entire framework of the Buddhist path. For a person who possesses such knowledge, the recitation of even a short guru yoga text can become a profound guru devotion practice. It is for this reason that I always emphasize the importance of study for Buddhist practitioners. It is very difficult to explain the importance of guru devotion to someone not familiar with Buddhist doctrines because if such a person is doubtful of the possibility of buddhahood in the first place, there is not much point in repeating that Vajradhara has said that the spiritual masters are manifestations of the buddhas. 

Therefore, first of all it is very important to have some understanding of emptiness and the law of interdependence and how they are complementary. This will enable you to develop deep conviction in the law of causality, which in turn will enable you to develop conviction in things that are beyond the perception of ordinary beings, thus helping you to have conviction in the Three Jewels. 

You can reason that if the spiritual master Buddha Shakyamuni has proved  
truthful and reliable on very profound matters—like emptiness and impermanence—then his statement that the spiritual master is the manifestation of the Buddha can also be relied upon. Approaching the topic in such a manner will enable you to develop a deep faith and conviction in the Buddha’s doctrine; following the stages of the path found in Lamrim will then be very fruitful. Without such a basis, the practice of guru devotion may not be so beneficial and appealing at the beginning. 

*Cultivating Respect* 

It is through recollecting the great kindness of the spiritual master that one cultivates respect. Now, again focusing upon the master that you have visualized in front of you, reflect that the understanding you develop of the entire path is due to his kindness. Because of the force of this contemplation, nectar descends and so forth. 

The guru’s kindness includes the kindness of giving you teachings and taming your mind and so forth. You should mentally review the great kindness of the individual spiritual masters, beginning with those who taught you the alphabet and how to read, and including those who gave teachings on the treatises; monastic, bodhisattva, and tantric vows; commentaries on generation and completion stages of tantra; transmissions and so forth; and even advice as to the way you lead your life. So the entire way of life and outlook are taught by the spiritual masters. 

When you think in such terms, you will truly be able to see the great kindness of the spiritual master; his kindness surpasses that of Buddha Shakyamuni. From the point of view of qualifications, all the buddhas are equal, but from the point of view of kindness, the spiritual master’s kindness far exceeds that of the buddhas. 

Having perceived the master as the Buddha, cultivate strong faith, and, reflecting upon his kindness, develop deep respect for him. That is how to relate to a spiritual master through thought. 

**RELIANCE THROUGH ACTION** 

This practice is done by following the teachings that the spiritual master has given, living according to his advice, and making offerings to him and serving him. 

Although living according to his advice is the real offering to a master, if  
you find that any part of the master’s advice contradicts the general mode of approach of the Buddhist doctrine, you should examine it and then explain to the spiritual master why you cannot fulfill that advice. As Ashvagosha said in his *Guru Panchashika* (Fifty Verses on the Guru), “Regarding the directions that are unfit, explain their unsuitability in words.” Also, Gunaprabha in his *Vinayasutra* (The Condensed Essence of Ethics) said, “Reverse the directions if they are unwholesome.” In the same vein, a Mahayana sutra reads, “Comply well with the advice that accords with the positive ideals, and act contrary to that which is against the principles.” There are some exceptions where the spiritual master sees very special benefits for a certain individual; then, although the advice may not directly accord with the general approach of Buddhist doctrine, it is nevertheless given. I am telling you all this from my own experience; not everything I say should be accepted by you. If what the Dalai Lama says accords with the general mode of approach of the Buddha’s doctrine and seems sensible, then you should follow it; if you find that anything that the Dalai Lama says contradicts the general approach of the Buddha’s doctrine, you should just leave it. This is an important point. 

If you do not apply this caution, there is a danger that a person who claims to be a spiritual master but who is ignorant of the Buddha’s doctrine may give some advice that could prove harmful. Then, both the disciples and the master will harm themselves. 

Therefore, it is very important to judge whether or not the direction given accords with the framework of the Buddhist doctrine encompassed in the *Tripitaka* (Three Scriptural Collections).3 Many people in the West mistakenly term Tibetan Buddhism *Lamaism*;4 so, there is also a danger, if you are not very careful, of really making it Lamaism in the true sense of that word. This point has been greatly emphasized by Lama Tsongkhapa in his *Lamrim Chenmo*. 

**CONCLUDING ACTIVITIES** 

While meditating on the practice of reliance, make requests to the spiritual masters in front of you. In a *sadhana*, when one feels exhausted by the meditation, at the end one can do the repetition of mantras; in the same manner here, after you do the specific meditations on Lamrim, you should follow with the rest of the recitation and repetition of the guru’s name mantra or praise verses. Invoke your master’s inspiration, and dedicate all the merit that you have gained through such a practice to the benefit of all beings. You can again visualize nectar descending from the spiritual master at your crown,  
and passing down through your body, or you could do the visualization of the guru himself descending through your crown and entering into your heart, remaining there inseparably. This is a very powerful practice, which will make you invulnerable to negative actions, because you will always feel that the guru is there to witness all your actions. 

Although the practice of proper reliance on a spiritual master is contemplative in nature, at the end of the contemplation you should do absorptive meditations as well, dwelling on the conclusion. This combined practice of contemplation and absorption is necessary. 

You should end each session of Lamrim practice before you become exhausted; otherwise, if you try to make sessions very long, you may feel so tired that you will not want to repeat them. Therefore, initially it is very important to end the session when you are not yet tired, so that your practice of dharma will be steady like a stream, not momentary like water gushing out of a broken tank, emptying the tank in a few minutes.  
14\. RECOGNIZING THE HUMAN POTENTIAL 

THE FIRST OF the practices based on a proper reliance on a spiritual master is the persuading of oneself to take the essence of having obtained a human life of leisure and opportunity. 

First it is important to recognize the human form as rare and precious. It is not enough just to obtain this precious human form which has great potential; rather, you should use that potential to its fullest extent by taking its essence. For example, if a person’s ascent to high office is not followed by good work for the community and people, it is not very beneficial and worthwhile. If, on the basis of full use of the potential, one is able to accomplish great feats, that would truly be a great success. Therefore, it is important initially to recognize all the significance and great potential of this human existence. 

What is the meaning of human existence endowed with leisure1 and fortune? *Leisure* refers to having time, just as the word is ordinarily used when one asks whether or not people have the time to do such and such. Therefore, this term refers to a human existence that has the time to undertake the practice. 

Other forms of existence, such as animals, do not have the chance to think about dharma because they are under the strong influence of ignorance. Compared to them, we human beings are amply endowed with the leisure and capacity to practice dharma. 

So, just as the masters said, if you were to take rebirth right now in the lower realms, then the doctrine of the buddhas and the teachings of tantra, although they might exist in this world, would not be of much benefit to you. Although you might take favorable forms of existence in *deva* realms and so forth, since the practice of dharma has to be undertaken on the basis of enhancing one’s mind, and since in such realms one’s mind is under strong influences, you would not have the opportunity that you have right now. But this is not the case with you. 

Furthermore, you have not taken rebirth at a time when the Buddha’s  
doctrine has totally lived out its duration of benefit. Rather, it is still active and very much relevant. But even though you have taken rebirth at such a time, if you were born in a country where dharma was totally inaccessible, then you would not benefit from your human existence. This is not the case with you either. 

Even though you have taken rebirth in a country or community where dharma is available, if you were to lack physical and mental capabilities, you would not be able to benefit from its availability. This is not the case, nor is it the case that you are under the influence of wrong views, such as the total negation of the possibility of rebirth or the authenticity of dharma. Whether or not you have cultivated a deep conviction derived from valid cognition, you do have a certain understanding of dharma that is powerful enough to persuade you to take an interest in it. 

Therefore, at this juncture, if you probe you will find that you are free of most of the obvious adverse conditions for the practice of dharma and that you are equipped with favorable conditions. You are free from lack of leisure, and on top of that you possess what are called the ten endowments,2 personal and circumstantial. You have been born at a time when, although the Buddha is not still alive, his doctrine is still alive and you can meet a living spiritual master. Also, you can emulate certain exemplary personalities who have gained high realizations by engaging in such a practice. So, if you think in such terms, you will be really able to admire and rejoice in the present opportunity. 

After you reflect along these lines, it is very important that you finally make a conclusion and decide on the basis of this human existence to explore its potential to its fullest extent by engaging in a serious practice of dharma. So, request the spiritual master at your crown to grant you the inspiration to overcome the obstacles to your realizations. On the basis of this precious human form, you will be able to accomplish great feats—not only the assurance of well-being in future lifetimes, but also the fulfillment of the final aspiration. 

Chandrakirti, in his *Guide to the Middle Way*, chapter two, said: 

If one doesn’t restrain oneself (from one’s downfalls) 

When one is free and lives agreeably, 

How can one raise oneself in the future, 

When one falls into an abyss and is at others’ mercy?  
**RARITY OF HUMAN EXISTENCE** 

Having reflected upon the great significance and potential of human existence, you should reflect upon its rarity. Although something might be rare, if it does not have any potential to bring about great benefit, it is not very precious. Present human existence is not like that. Not only is it rare to find, it also has great potential; on its basis one will not only be able to attain a higher rebirth, but can also obtain the omniscient state. 

Since the beginning of life on this planet, for more than five billion years, many forms of life have existed and have gone through a process of evolution. Of all these forms, one finds that the human form is the most sophisticated, in terms of having not only a positive capacity but also a destructive one. Humans possess a very sophisticated brain, which has great power and capability, and are endowed with a faculty that enables them to plan things and judge between right and wrong. So, among all the forms of life, one finds no history that can compare with that of human beings. 

Besides the category of phenomena that are obvious to one, phenomena that are hidden to one at present, such as the momentary nature of things, the emptiness of inherent existence, and so forth, can also eventually be understood on the basis of a human body employing the human faculties. Furthermore, on this basis one will be able to cultivate the very strong force of the altruistic attitude as well as receive very profound vows—tantric, bodhicitta, or monastic—with which one will be able to accumulate great stores of merit. Therefore, from all these points of view—those of ultimate and temporary aims—the human body is equipped with a great capacity. 

You should rejoice that you have obtained such a body and should decide never to waste its potential. If the effort is made on your part, you will be able to attain great achievements. Many masters of the past, Indian and Tibetan masters of all the great traditions, achieved their high realizations on the basis of the human form. Regarded as a basis, the human body that you possess, and the bodies of the great beings, have no difference between them. Think that, like the great masters who achieved high realizations on the basis of this precious human body and achieved the completely enlightened state, you also will work for the achievement of the omniscient state on the basis of this present human existence. You have obtained this great opportunity; if you do not take the initiative right now, when will you? It is now or never. That is how you should reflect. 

By emulating the examples of great personalities of the past, by pondering upon scriptural quotations and anecdotes taught by teachers, by employing all sorts of means, you should be able to develop a deep conviction that this  
present human body has great potential and that you shall never waste even a single minute of its use. On the other hand, not taking any essence of this precious human existence, but just wasting it, is almost like taking poison while being fully aware of the consequences of doing so. It is very wrong for people to feel deeply sad when they lose some money, while when they waste the precious moments of their lives they do not have the slightest feeling of regret. Such an indifference comes as a result of not realizing the value and rarity of the precious human existence. Therefore, you should determine that on the basis of this precious human existence you have the capability and capacity to undertake the practice of dharma. 

**DIFFICULTY OF ATTAINING HUMAN EXISTENCE** 

In the next phase, you should reflect upon the difficulty of obtaining a human existence in the future. You should reflect upon the rarity of obtaining a human form from the point of view of its causes: how only through the aggregation of many factors can one achieve it. Compared to other forms of existence and life, human existence and life are very rare and difficult to find. 

When you reflect upon the rarity of the precious human form, you might have the feeling that although this human existence has great potential, since you are already quite old it might be better to hope to obtain a better human existence in a future life and embark then upon the path when you are much younger. But it is very difficult to say whether or not you will succeed in obtaining a precious human existence in the future. Such an attitude is almost like that of a person who, when having money with him, spends it without any consideration and purpose, just hoping that he will get more in the future and be able to do business with it. Such a person is stupid. By comparison, a person who, even though he might have a very small amount of money, preserves it and builds on it and does whatever business he wants to with it is a more intelligent person. Similarly, you should use the present potential of the human body already at hand, rather than hope for the future. 

Unlike other forms of life, such as elephants, however old we might be we are able to recite at least a mantra and are able to ponder upon questions of karma and its results and our future lives and so forth. There is still potential within us to make progress. 

Now, how do we reflect on the rarity of attaining a human existence? First of all, I think it is very important to have some understanding of the Buddhist view of dependent origination. How do we determine whether or not something exists? This is done on the basis of whether or not a phenomenon  
is established by a certifying consciousness, a valid cognizer. Within the category of existent phenomena, there are some that exist occasionally. The occasional nature of their existence is a sign that they depend upon other factors, causes, and conditions for their arisal; therefore, they are other powered. The other type is that of permanent phenomena which do not depend on causes and conditions for their existence. 

The first category of phenomena consists of dependent phenomena, and within this category there are external phenomena like matter, and others that are only in the nature of clarity and knowing, which are known as consciousnesses. Then there are others such as time, which are abstract phenomena—although they exist, they are not tangible like material phenomena. So, we find that there are three categories of dependent phenomena. 

Since we are concerned with the phenomena that directly relate to our experience of pain and pleasure, we are here concerned with the phenomena that are related to consciousness. One can never talk about pain and pleasure as isolated from consciousness. Here it is important to reflect on the causality of phenomena that are related to our inner faculty, mind and consciousness. It is very obvious to us that the body, which is the basis for our experience of pain and pleasure, is in the nature of suffering and is dependent upon causes and conditions. Then, we possess the faculty called consciousness; it exists, it is the agent through which we experience pain and pleasure, but it does not possess any form, color, or anything. Yet this mysterious force is there. 

Just as the external body has causes and conditions, the inner faculty, consciousness, also has causes and conditions. When we reflect in such terms, we will be able to see that within the causes there are two types: substantial causes that eventually turn into their fruits, and cooperative causes that contribute to the production of particular fruits. Phenomena possess certain essential qualities—for example, the wetness of water and the heat of fire— 

which are their natural defining characteristics. These characteristics cannot be said to be produced by a specific cause. I do not know if the karmic forces of sentient beings can affect these natural characteristics. 

We find that within phenomena there are certain laws: natural laws, the laws of dependence, functional laws, and the laws of logical evidence. The first one, the law of nature, is very important as a basis; first of all, it is very important to recognize the basic nature of a phenomenon. For example, the basic nature of a consciousness is clarity and knowing. After having perceived the basic nature of a consciousness on the basis of such knowledge, one will be able to understand it better. Understanding that the basic element  
of matter is atoms will be likewise helpful. 

I think that there are some parallels between the disciplines of modern science—physics, chemistry, etc.—and some of the Buddhist concepts. Matter possesses certain natural characteristics, and consciousness possesses certain characteristics as well. The *Kalachakra Tantra* speaks of space particles as the source of all matter, from which later evolves this entire universe; eventually, all matter will be dissolved back into the space particles. I do not know whether or not one can posit a beginning or an end to these subtle particles. But in *Chatu-shataka Shastra* (The Four Hundred Verses), Aryadeva does say that although lacking a beginning, matter does possess an end. So, if we trace the matter that we see on this earth to its source, we will find that it is originally in the form of potential in these space particles. 

When we reflect in such terms, we will be able to see a basic law of inter dependence within all these phenomena. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to speak fully about all the subtle aspects of these laws. Buddhist philosophy speaks of the extremely subtle aspect of karmic law, the law of causality, as an object of knowledge only for the omniscient mind, and perceptible only by the wisdom of a fully enlightened being. 

All the phenomena that are directly related to our experience of pain and pleasure—of the body, environment, and so forth—due to their causal conditions increase and decrease and go through the process of change. Among these phenomena there are certain ones that go through the process of change naturally, and others, such as the experiences of happiness and suffering, that go through certain changes when the being interacts with external conditions. 

In order to achieve a human existence in the future with a precious body, the causes and conditions that bring about such a result should also be precious, because there should be a concordance between causes and their effects. Just as the result is very rare, similarly the causes themselves are very rare. So the appropriate cause for obtaining a human existence in the future, as the text here discusses, is to have a very proper foundation of a practice of morality—at minimum an abstaining from the ten negative actions.3In addition to this basis, the practice of generosity, patience, and so on are also required, which will contribute to the positive qualities of human existence such as having a better intelligence, and so forth. These complementing factors should themselves be complemented by aspirational prayers dedicated to the obtaining of such a human form conducive to the practice of dharma. So, you need these three factors: the foundation, the complementing practices, and a strong force of aspiration to obtain such a body.  
If we were to examine whether or not we possess within us these causes that have the potential and power to bring about a human existence in the future, we would find that achieving such an existence is very difficult, very rare, for us. Most of us are so habituated to negative actions and emotions that virtuous thoughts come about only accidentally or through great effort. We are not as accustomed to them as we are to negative actions, which flow like a stream of water running downhill. Because of the habit of our minds, the arisal of negative emotions is effortless for us, whereas the arisal of virtuous thoughts is very difficult—we really have to work to generate them, as though we were driving a donkey up hill. If we consider matters in such terms, we will find that our own minds are always tormented by negative thoughts and that these impulses lead us to negative actions. If this is what happens when we are born as human beings and are equipped with the knowledge to discriminate between right and wrong, what would it be like if we were born in the lower realms, as animals for example, and were not equipped with such knowledge or intelligence? 

If we think in such terms, we will be able to infer that we must have accumulated great stores of non-virtues and negativities in past lives. If we were to recollect our own past actions even in this lifetime, we would find that we have indulged in more negative actions than positive. If such is the case with this present life, there is no need to say what kind of actions we must have committed in past lives. 

Furthermore, the negative actions in which we have indulged are really very complete from all points of view. For example, when we kill a mosquito or a bug, we have the intention to kill it, we use the most severe means to kill it, and then at the end we rejoice that we have killed it. So, even one negative action has a very strong motivation, an action, and also a sense of satisfaction at the end. This is not the case with positive actions. Besides, negative actions have the potential to increase, whereas positive actions can be destroyed by many adverse circumstances. For example, although we may have accumulated great stores of merit by making prostrations and so forth, if we generate strong anger, this anger—even though it might be momentary—will just blow away a large part of the merit that we might have accumulated yesterday. We will then have to start all over again. 

We find that it is very rare that we engage in positive actions. Even those that are accumulated are very weak and also very vulnerable to the effects of negative actions. In view of this, it is important to study the texts that speak of the great advantage of reflecting upon emptiness; even a slight understanding of emptiness, be it just a wavering thought, can destroy great stores of  
negative karma. This is very true, and reflection on it will give us encouragement to accumulate merit. 

Judge whether or not you possess these causes within you for obtaining a precious human life in the future. If you develop a certainty that you possess these factors within you, then there is no need to request or seek others’ help, because you possess all the necessary conditions within you. But if you lack these basic factors, then, even though you might invoke the power and inspiration of other forces, it is very doubtful that you will be helped. 

When you do the meditation, reflect upon the rarity of the precious human existence first by using all kinds of analogies (though it is very difficult to find an analogy that can totally illustrate the great potential of human existence), and then by considering it in terms of its own nature, and finally by thinking about the rarity of its causes. This order of reflection on the rarity of the precious human existence of leisure and fortune is said to have great significance and has been recommended by many great masters of the past. 

If you think in such terms, you will be able to convince yourself that you should make the effort and take the initiative right now when you have obtained a human life. So, make whatever effort you can, now that you have a human body. Make the decision to undertake dharma practice right now in this very life. With that, the reflection on the great significance and rarity of human life is over, and you should affirm this by again visualizing nectar descending and so forth. 

These reflections help persuade us from within to engage in the practice of dharma, and thus are preliminary factors. Next follows the actual path. This is divided into three: training the mind in the stages of the path common to the practitioners of initial capacity, training the mind in the stages of the path common to the middling capacity, and training the mind in the stages of the path of the great capacity.  
15\. DEATH AND IMPERMANENCE 

THE ESSENCE OF the reflection on death and impermanence can be condensed into a verse from the *Chatu-shataka Shastra:* 

Unwholesome deeds should be reversed first, 

And then in the middle, the “self.” 

Later eliminate all erroneous views. 

He who knows such a sequence is wise. 

You should develop the conviction that awareness of death and impermanence is an important element of the Buddha’s teaching, and that this is why the Buddha taught impermanence at the beginning of all his teachings when he first taught the Four Noble Truths. 

The first phase of the practice is to restrain the negative actions that could propel you to lower realms of existence. The cause of your body is contaminated actions and delusions, and as long as you are under their influence there is no place for happiness. In a similar way there is no possibility of happiness and peace while someone is under the leadership of a very negative person. Therefore, reflect upon the fact that you are under the rule of ignorance; ignorance is like the despotic king, and anger and attachment are like his ministers. We live under the tyranny and influence of ignorance, the self-grasping attitude, and also the self-cherishing attitude— factors that all the buddhas and bodhisattvas treat as real enemies. The worst thing is to be under the influence and grip of these negative factors; therefore in the second chapter of *Pramanavartika* (A Thorough Explanation of Valid Cognitions), Dharmakirti says that from the reflection on impermanence one will be able to lead oneself on to the realization of the suffering nature. 

The second phase is to engage in the method of rooting out the delusions that are the root of these negative actions. This is done by applying their opponent force, the wisdom realizing emptiness, which eliminates the grasping at self-existence. Eliminating these delusions, together with their
