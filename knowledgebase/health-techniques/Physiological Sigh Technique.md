How to reduce stress in 10 seconds (backed by science). Physiological
Sigh Technique:

Dr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist and professor at Stanford. In a
recent podcast, he shared the most immediate way to lower stress levels
(ﬁrst discovered in the 30s)! It's called the "physiological sigh."
(You'll notice dogs do this naturally when they're falling asleep.) The
best part? It only takes 10 seconds...

Step 1: Inhale fully through your nose. Pause. Inhale one more sip of
air.

Step 2: Exhale slowly through the mouth until your lungs feel empty.
Repeat 1-2 times.

---Why it works--- 1) A double inhale reinﬂates all the sacks of oxygen
in your lungs. A long exhale discards a large amount of carbon dioxide
(which is responsible for signaling the stress response). 2) When your
exhales are longer than your inhales, your heart rate slows. And it
activates neural circuits for calming.

So, the next time your heart is pounding (before walking out on stage,
starting a high-stakes meeting, or giving an important pitch)... Inhale
twice. Long exhale. This combo is like a "natural tranquilizer" for your
stress response.

Try it out. Let me know how it goes! If you enjoyed reading this, follow
