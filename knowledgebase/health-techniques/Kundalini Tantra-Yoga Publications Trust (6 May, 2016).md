:::

::: {.class177 lang="en-us"}
I have been travelling the world for the last three decades in order to
pass on the message of yoga, and I find that yoga has influenced the
course of human thinking tremendously. Initially of course, there was
some doubt about it as many people thought that yoga was a type of
religion, witchcraft or mysticism. This particularly happened because
man believed matter was the ultimate point in the evolution of nature.
The materialistic world did not understand yoga for some time, but as
scientists dived deep into the mysteries of matter, they came to
understand and realize that matter was not the ultimate in the evolution
of nature.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[If that is so for one form of matter, it applies to every form of
matter. This external experience, the perception you have through your
senses, is a product of matter. Even your thoughts, feelings, emotions
and cognitions are products of matter. Therefore, they cannot be
absolute and final. This means there must be another realm of
experience, and if there is another realm of experience, it must be
possible to transcend the present limitations of the mind.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The mind is also matter; it is definitely not spirit. Therefore, the
mind can also be transformed and made to evolve. Many people have begun
to realize and experience this fact in the last few decades. In my
opinion, this marks the end of one era and the beginning of another. For
those who have some knowledge of science and the nature of]{.class-0}
[]{#part0007.xhtml_page_2 .class-0} [matter, it is not difficult to
understand exactly what inner experience is.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[An inner experience is the manifestation of a deeper level of oneself.
Dream, of course, is an experience. Your dreams may be schizophrenic,
but that is an expression of your own self. Thought is also a concept or
expression of your own self. A piece of music is an expression of your
self, whether you compose it or just admire it. A painting or sculpture
is a concept of your self whether you create it or just admire it. That
means the external world is a manifestation of your inner experience,
and you can improve this experience to any extent. You can also bring
about deterioration of this experience. When everything is hopeless
outside, that is your experience of yourself, and if everything is
beautiful outside, that is also your experience of yourself.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In the last few decades, yoga has helped millions of people to improve
their self-concept. Yoga realizes that man is not only the mind, but the
body as well. Therefore, one does not experience happiness only through
the mind. The body is also real and it is a part of one's personality.
Just improving the condition of the body, however, will not necessarily
enable the mind to experience happiness either. This is because man is
not only the body and mind, but emotion and desire as well. He is
something beyond the mind or psyche. Therefore, yoga has been designed
in such a way that it can complete the process of evolution of the
personality in every possible direction. That is why yoga has so many
branches -- hatha yoga, karma yoga, bhakti yoga, raja yoga, jnana yoga,
kundalini yoga, and so on.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[A combined, integrated practice of yoga in one's life will definitely
ensure a better quality of experience within you and without. Every
seeker and practitioner on the path of yoga must remember that the
various paths of yoga are to improve the quality of head, heart and
hands. However, yoga does not end with the development of the
personality. One level of the personality is dependent on this mind,
this body and these emotions, but there is another deeper part of
the]{.class-0} []{#part0007.xhtml_page_3 .class-0} [personality which
you have to develop with another kind of mind and emotion. This requires
a special process, and that process is known as kundalini
yoga.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Objective experience is not the ultimate
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Kundalini yoga is a part of the tantric tradition. Although you may have
already been introduced to yoga, it is also necessary for you to know
something about tantra. Since ancient times, the wise have realized that
the mind can be expanded and that experiences do not necessarily depend
on an object. This means that if somebody is playing music, I can hear
it, and if somebody has painted a picture, I can see it, but I can also
see if there is no picture, and I can hear if there is no music. This is
also a quality of the personality which has been ignored in the last one
hundred and fifty to two hundred years.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Tantra says that the range of mental experience can be broadened. With
the help of the senses, your mind can have an experience based on an
object. There can be an experience within the framework of time, space
and object, but there can also be an experience beyond the framework of
time, space and object. The second form of experience can happen when
the present mind expands beyond its given definitions and borders, and
when this experience occurs, energy is released from
yourself.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[For hundreds of years, people have been talking about an experience
called nirvana, moksha, emancipation, self-realization, salvation or
liberation, without understanding it properly. Yogis call this
experience samadhi. Although many people think that in samadhi or
nirvana everything is completely finished, it is definitely not a
process of quitting the world. Nothing finishes, only one level of
experience ends, but then another begins.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Since the dawn of creation, the tantrics and yogis have realized that
in this physical body there is a potential force. It is not
psychological, philosophical or transcendental; it is a dynamic
potential force in the material body, and it is]{.class-0}
[]{#part0007.xhtml_page_4 .class-0} [called kundalini. This kundalini is
the greatest discovery of tantra and yoga. Scientists have begun to look
into this, and a summary of some of the latest scientific experiments is
included in this book. We can see from this research that science is not
actually going to discover anything new in this field. It is only
rediscovering and substantiating what yogis discovered many, many
centuries ago.]{.class-0}

A universal event
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The seat of kundalini is a small gland at the base of the spinal cord.
With the evolution of the natural forces in man, this gland has now come
to a point where man can explode it. Those people who have awakened this
supernatural force have been called rishis, prophets, yogis, siddhas and
various other names according to the time, tradition and culture. In
India the entire cultural set-up was once organized to facilitate this
explosion, but today things are a little different because materialism
is a very powerful force, and for the moment it has even stupefied the
Indian mind.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[For the awakening of kundalini, not only the practices of yoga are
required. If this awakening is to become a universal event, then the
entire social structure has to be reorganized and millions of people all
over the world have to be told the purpose of their existence. The whole
of life from the time of conception to the moment when you leave the
body, each and everything has to be reoriented. You will see in this
book how even the instinctive and emotional interaction between men and
women must be revised and refined, so that it can lead us not away from,
but towards this ultimate awakening. This reorientation has to be
undertaken with the purpose of expanding the mind and opening new doors
of experience.]{.class-0}

[Today we are living in a world where everyone is more or less
satisfied. We have all the comforts and everything we need and do not

[E]{.class220-kfx-dropcap} verybody should know something about
kundalini as it represents the coming consciousness of mankind.
Kundalini is the name of a sleeping dormant potential force in the human
organism and it is situated at the root of the spinal column. In the
masculine body it is in the perineum, between the urinary and excretory
organs. In the female body its location is at the root of the uterus, in
the cervix. This centre is known as mooladhara chakra and it is actually
a physical structure. It is a small gland which you can even take out
and press. However, kundalini is a dormant energy, and even if you press
it, it will not explode like a bomb.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[To awaken kundalini you must prepare yourself through yogic techniques.
You must practise asanas, pranayama, kriya yoga and meditation. Then,
when you are able to direct your prana into the seat of kundalini, the
energy wakes up and makes its way through sushumna nadi, in the central
nervous canal, to the brain. As kundalini ascends, it passes through
each of the chakras which are interconnected with the different silent
areas of the brain. With the awakening of kundalini there is an
explosion in the brain as the dormant or sleeping areas start blossoming
like flowers. Therefore, kundalini can be equated with the awakening of
the silent areas of the brain.]{.class-0}

How kundalini was discovered
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Right from the beginning of creation, man witnessed many transcendental
happenings. Sometimes he was able to read the thoughts of others, he
witnessed somebody else's predictions coming true, or he may even have
seen his own dreams manifesting into realities. He pondered over the
fact that some people could write inspiring poems or compose beautiful
music whereas others could not; one person could fight on the
battlefield for days together and another person could not even get out
of bed. So he wanted to discover why everybody seemed to be different.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[During the course of his investigations, man came to understand that
within every individual there is a special form of energy. He saw that
in some people this energy was dormant, in others it was evolving and in
a very small minority it was actually awakened. Originally, man named
this energy after the gods, goddesses, angels or divinities. Then he
discovered prana and called it prana shakti. In tantra they called it
kundalini.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
What the various names for kundalini mean
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In Sanskrit, [kundal]{.class5827-0} means a coil, and so kundalini has
been described as that which is coiled. This is the traditional
[]{#part0010.xhtml_page_15} belief, but it has been incorrectly
understood. The word [kundalini]{.class5827-0} actually comes from the
word [kunda]{.class5827-0} , meaning a deeper place, pit or cavity. The
fire used in the ceremony of initiation is kindled in a pit called a
kunda. Similarly, the place where a dead body is burned is a kunda. If
you dig a ditch or a hole, it is called a kunda. Kunda refers to the
concave cavity in which the brain, resembling a coiled and sleeping
serpent, nestles. (If you have the opportunity of examining a dissection
of the human brain you will see that it is in the form of a coil or
snake curled up upon itself.) This is the true meaning of kundalini. The
word kundalini refers to the shakti or power when it is in its dormant
potential state, but when it is manifesting, you can call it Devi, Kali,
Durga, Saraswati, Lakshmi or any other name according to the
manifestation it is exhibiting before you.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In the Christian tradition, the terms 'the Path of the Initiates' and
'the Stairway to Heaven' used in the Bible, refer to kundalini's ascent
through sushumna nadi. The ascent of kundalini and, ultimately, the
descent of spiritual grace, are symbolized by the cross. This is why
Christians make the sign of the cross at ajna, anahata and vishuddhi
chakras, for ajna is the centre where the ascending consciousness is
transcended and anahata is where the descending grace is made manifest
to the world.]{.class-0}

[Whatever happens in spiritual life, it is related to the awakening of

Kundalini, Kali and Durga
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
When kundalini has just awakened and you are not able to handle it, it
is called Kali. When you can handle it and are able to use it for
beneficial purposes and you become powerful on account of it, it is
called Durga.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Kali is a female deity, naked, black or smoky in colour, wearing a mala
of one hundred and eight human skulls,]{.class-0}
[]{#part0010.xhtml_page_16 .class-0} [representing the memories of
different births. Kali's lolling tongue of a blood red colour signifies
the rajo guna whose circular movement gives impetus to all creative
activities. By this specific gesture, she is exhorting sadhakas to
control their rajo guna. The sacrificial sword and the severed head held
by the left hand are the symbols of dissolution. Darkness and death are
by no means the mere absence of light and life, rather they are their
origin. The sadhaka worships the cosmic power in its female form, for
she represents the kinetic aspect, the masculine being the static aspect
which is activated only through her power.]{.class-0}

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In Hindu mythology, the awakening of Kali has been described in great
detail. When Kali rises in red anger, all the gods and demons are
stunned and everybody keeps quiet. They do not know what she is going to
do. They ask Lord Shiva to pacify her, but Kali roars ferociously,
throwing him down and standing on his chest with her mouth wide open,
thirsty for flesh and blood. When the devas hold prayers to pacify Kali,
she becomes calm and quiet.]{.class-0}

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Then there is the emergence of Durga, the higher, more refined and
benign symbols of the unconscious. Durga is a beautiful goddess seated

fifty-two letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, which are the outer
manifestations of Shabda Brahma or Brahma in the form of sound. Durga is

Symbolic representation of kundalini
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In the tantric texts, kundalini is conceived of as the primal power or
energy. In terms of modern psychology, it can be called the unconscious
in man. As we have just discussed, in Hindu mythology, kundalini
corresponds to the concept of Kali. In the philosophy of Shaivism, the
concept of kundalini is represented by the shivalingam, the oval-shaped
stone or pillar with a snake coiled around it.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[However, most commonly, kundalini is illustrated as a sleeping serpent
coiled three and a half times. Of course, there is no serpent residing
in mooladhara, sahasrara or any other chakra, but the serpent has always
been a symbol for efficient consciousness. In all the oldest mystic
cults of the world you will find the serpent, and if you have seen any
pictures of images of Lord Shiva, you will have noticed serpents
girdling his waist, neck and arms. Kali is also adorned with serpents
and Lord Vishnu eternally reposes on a large coiled serpent. This
serpent power symbolizes the unconscious in man.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In Scandinavian, European, Latin American and Middle Eastern countries
and many different civilizations of the world, the concept of the
serpent power is represented in monuments and ancient artefacts. This
means that kundalini was known to people from all parts of the world in
the past. However, we can conceive of kundalini in any manner we like
because actually, prana has no form or dimension, it is
infinite.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In the traditional descriptions of kundalini awakening, it is said that
kundalini resides in mooladhara in the form of a coiled snake and when
the snake awakens it uncoils and shoots up through sushumna (the psychic
passage in the centre of the spinal cord), opening the other chakras as
it goes. (See Sir John Woodroffe's]{.class-0} [The Serpent
Power]{.class5827-1} [.)]{.class-0} []{#part0010.xhtml_page_18 .class-0}
[Brahmachari Swami Vyasdev, in his book]{.class-0} [Science of the
Soul]{.class5827-1} [, describes the awakening of kundalini in the
following way: "Sadhakas have seen the sushumna in the form of a
luminous rod or pillar, a golden yellow snake, or sometimes as a shining
black snake about ten inches long with blood red eyes like smouldering
charcoal, the front part of the tongue vibrating and shining like
lightning, ascending the spinal column."]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The meaning of the three coils of the serpent is as follows: the three
coils represent the three matras of Om, which relate to past, present
and future; to the three gunas: tamas, rajas and sattwa; to the three
states of consciousness: waking, sleeping and dreaming; and to the three
types of experience: subjective experience, sensual experience and
absence of experience. The half coil represents the state of
transcendence, where there is neither waking, sleeping nor dreaming. So,
the three and a half coils signify the total experience of the universe

more to do with the quality of our experiences and perceptions. When
kundalini wakes up, your mind changes and your priorities and
attachments also change. All your karmas undergo a process of
integration. It is very simple to understand. When you were a child you
loved toys, but why don't you love them now? Because your mind has
changed and consequently, your attachments have also changed. So with
the awakening of kundalini, a metamorphosis takes place. There is even
the possibility of restructuring the entire physical body.

[When kundalini awakens, the physical body actually undergoes many
changes. Generally they are positive, but if your guru is not cautious,
they can be negative also. When the shakti wakes up, the cells in the

The voice changes, the smell of the body changes and the hormonal
secretions also change. In fact, the transformation of cells in the body

The chakras
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The literal meaning of the word [chakra]{.class5827-0} is 'wheel' or
'circle', but in the yogic context a better translation of the Sanskrit
word is 'vortex' or 'whirlpool'. The chakras are vortices of psychic
energy and they are visualized and experienced as circular movements of
energy at particular rates of vibration.

[In each person there are myriads of chakras, but in the practices of
tantra and yoga, only a few principal ones are utilized. These chakras

subtle.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The chakras relate to physiological as well as psychic centres whose
structures correspond more or less with the traditional descriptions.
These nerve centres are not situated inside the spinal cord itself, but
lie like junctions on the interior walls of the spinal column. If you
cut the spinal cord transversely at different levels, you can see that
the grey matter in the cross section resembles the lotus shape and the
ascending and descending tracts of nerve fibres correspond to the nadis.
These communicating nerve fibres control the different physiological
functions of that portion of the body. Many books state that the chakras
are reservoirs of power, but this is not true.]{.class-0}

This arrangement is the same for each one of the chakras. The nadis
which emerge from each chakra carry prana in both directions. There is a
forward and backward pranic motion in the nadis, which is analogous to
the flow of alternating current in electrical wires. The outgoing

Nadis
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Nadis are not nerves but rather channels for the flow of consciousness.
The literal meaning of [nadi]{.class5827-0} is flow. Just as the
negative and positive forces of electricity flow through complex
circuits, in the same way, [prana shakti]{.class5827-0} (vital force)
and [manas shakti]{.class5827-0} (mental force) flow through every part
of our body via these nadis. According to the tantras there are 72,000
or more such channels or networks through which the stimuli flow like an
electric current from one point to another. These 72,000 nadis cover the
whole body and through them the inherent rhythms of activity in the
different organs of the body are maintained. Within this network of
nadis, there are ten main channels, and of these ten, three are most
important for they control the flow of prana and consciousness within
all the other nadis of the body. These three nadis are called ida,
pingala and sushumna. [Ida nadi]{.class5827-0} controls all the mental
processes, while [pingala nadi]{.class5827-0} controls all the vital
processes. Ida is known as the moon, and pingala as the sun. A third
nadi, [sushumna]{.class5827-0} , is the channel for the awakening of
spiritual consciousness. You may consider these three nadis as pranic
force, mental force and spiritual force.

[As sushumna flows inside the central canal of the spinal cord, ida and
pingala simultaneously flow on the outer surface of the spinal cord,
still within the bony vertebral column. Ida, pingala and sushumna nadis
begin in mooladhara in the pelvic floor. From there, sushumna flows
directly upwards within the central canal, while ida passes to the left
and pingala to the right. At swadhisthana chakra, or the sacral plexus,
the three nadis come together again and ida and pingala cross over one
another. Ida passes up to the right, pingala to the left, and sushumna
continues to flow directly upwards in the central canal. The three nadis
come together again at manipura chakra, the solar plexus, and so on.
Finally, ida, pingala and sushumna meet in the ajna chakra.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {#part0012.xhtml_page_27 .class179 lang="en-us"}
[Ida and pingala function in the body alternately and not
simultaneously. If you observe your nostrils, you will find that
generally one is flowing freely and the other is blocked. When the left
nostril is open, it is the lunar energy or ida nadi which is flowing.

flowing.]{.class-0}

[In ordinary life this does not happen because the simultaneous
awakening and functioning of life force and consciousness can take place

The importance of awakening sushumna

Sushumna nadi is regarded as a hollow tube in which there are three more
concentric tubes, each being progressively more subtle than the previous
one. The tubes or nadis are as follows: [sushumna]{.class5827-0} --
signifying tamas, [vajrini]{.class5827-0} -- signifying rajas,
[chitrini]{.class5827-0} -- signifying sattwa, and
[brahma]{.class5827-0} -- signifying consciousness. The higher
consciousness created by kundalini passes through brahma nadi.

[Mooladhara chakra is just like a powerful generator. In order to start
this generator, you need some sort of pranic energy. This pranic energy
is generated through pranayama. When you practise pranayama you generate

starts the generator in mooladhara chakra. Then this generated energy is
pushed upward by a negative pressure and forced up to ajna
chakra.]{.class-0}

[Therefore, awakening of sushumna is just as important as awakening of
kundalini. Supposing you have started your generator but you have not

the generated energy can pass through the cable to the different areas
of your house.]{.class-0}

[When only ida and pingala are active and not sushumna, it is like

go down. Energy flows through ida and pingala all the time, but its
effulgence is very low. When there is current flowing in ida, pingala

understand the awakening of kundalini, the awakening of sushumna and the
union of the three in ajna chakra.]{.class-0}

The mystical tree

In the fifteenth chapter of the [Bhagavad Gita]{.class5827-0} there is a
description of the imperishable tree which has its roots at the top and
its trunk and branches below, growing downwards. One who knows this tree
knows the truth. This tree exists in the structure and function of the
human body and nervous system. One must know and climb this paradoxical
tree to arrive at the truth. It can be understood in this way: the
thoughts, the emotions, the distractions and so on are only the leaves
of this tree whose roots are the brain itself and whose trunk is the
spinal column. One has to climb this tree from the top to the bottom if
one wishes to cut the roots.

is paradoxical and irrational to the faculty of intellect. This same
tree is known as the 'Tree of Life' in the Kabbalah and as the 'Tree of
Knowledge' in the Bible. Its understanding forms the basis of both the

[T]{.class220-kfx-dropcap} he awakening of kundalini and its union with
Shiva is immediately and intimately connected with the whole brain. To
explain it simply, we can say the brain has ten compartments, and of
these, nine are dormant and one is active. Whatever you know, whatever
you think or do is coming from one-tenth of the brain. The other
nine-tenths, which are in the frontal portion of the brain, are known as
the inactive or sleeping brain.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Why are these compartments inactive? Because there is no energy. The
active portion of the brain functions on the energies of ida and
pingala, but the other nine-tenths have only pingala. Pingala is life
and ida is consciousness. If a person is living but is unable to think,
we say he has prana shakti but not manas shakti. Similarly, the silent
parts of the brain have prana, not consciousness.]{.class-0}

[Therefore, a very difficult question arises, which is how to awaken the
sleeping compartments of the brain? We know how to awaken fear, anxiety

awaken these dormant areas of the brain. In order to arouse the silent
areas of the brain, we must charge the frontal brain with sufficient
prana, with sufficient vital energy and consciousness, and we must
awaken sushumna nadi. For both these purposes we must practise pranayama
regularly and consistently over a long period of time.]{.class-0}

Lighting up the brain
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In kundalini yoga it was discovered that the different parts of the
brain are connected with the chakras. Certain areas are connected with
mooladhara chakra, others with swadhisthana, manipura, and so on. When
you want to turn on an electric lamp, you do not have to touch the lamp
itself, you operate it by means of the switch on the wall. Likewise,
when you want to awaken the brain, you cannot deal with it directly, you
have to flick the switches which are located in the chakras.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Modern science divides the dormant area of the brain into ten parts,
whereas in kundalini yoga we divide it into six. The qualities or
manifestations of the brain are also sixfold, for example, the psychic
powers. These manifest in different individuals according to the degree
of awakening in the corresponding areas of the brain. Not everybody is
clairvoyant or telepathic; some people are talented musicians. Anybody
can sing, but there is a centre in the brain where transcendental music
expresses itself.]{.class-0}

A genius is one who has awakened one or more of the dormant areas of the

momentary awakening in certain circuits of the brain. It is not total
awakening. When the total brain wakes up, you become a junior god, an
incarnation or embodiment of divinity. There are various types of
geniuses: child prodigies, inspired poets, musicians, inventors,
prophets, etc., in whom a partial awakening has occurred.

Sahasrara is the actual seat of kundalini
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Although the classical descriptions place heavy emphasis on the
awakening of kundalini in mooladhara chakra, there is a widespread
misconception that kundalini must be awakened there and made to travel
through and awaken all the chakras in turn. In fact, the seat of
kundalini is actually sahasrara. Mooladhara is only a manipulating
centre or switch, like the []{#part0013.xhtml_page_33} other chakras,
but it happens to be easier for most people to operate this switch.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Each of the chakras is independent; they are not connected with each
other. This means that if kundalini shakti awakens in mooladhara, it
goes directly to sahasrara, to a particular centre in the brain.
Similarly, from swadhisthana the shakti passes directly to sahasrara,
from manipura it goes straight to sahasrara and so on. Kundalini can be
awakened in an individual chakra or it can awaken throughout the whole
network of chakras collectively. From each chakra, the awakening shock
moves up to the top of sahasrara. However, the awakening is not
sustained and those centres in the brain return to dormancy. This is
what is meant by the return of kundalini to mooladhara.]{.class-0}

[If kundalini awakens in an individual chakra, the experiences which are
characteristic of that chakra will be brought into consciousness. This
may also occur when one does the practices for an individual chakra. For
example, swadhisthana practices will raise joy; manipura practices will
increase self-assertion; anahata stimulation will expand the love;
vishuddhi practices will awaken discrimination and wisdom, and ajna
practices will increase the flow of intuition, knowledge and perhaps

Kundalini -- energy or nerve messages?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
There are a number of schools of thought as to what kundalini really is.
Many yogis say that kundalini is a flow of pranic energy along an
esoteric pathway (sushumna) associated with the spinal axis. They
consider that it is part of the flow of prana within the meshwork of the
pranic body and that there is no anatomical counterpart. Other yogis
relate their perceptions of kundalini to the flow of messages along the
nerve fibres. These arise in the networks of the autonomic plexuses and
ascend along tracts in the spinal cord to definite anatomical centres in
the brain.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[These schools of thought use different descriptions to convey the
experience of kundalini, but they all agree that the experience of
kundalini is a total psychophysiological event which centres around the
spinal cord. Within the spinal cord there is a very important fluid, the
cerebrospinal fluid. When, through practices such as pranayama,
awakening occurs in mooladhara chakra, this fluid gets excited. We
cannot really say what happens to it because even the scientists are not
exactly sure, but by studying the experiences of kundalini awakening,
one thing is apparent. When the cerebrospinal fluid moves through the
vertebral column, it alters the phases of consciousness and this is a
very important process as far as evolution is concerned.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[It is the chitta or consciousness which undergoes evolution in man.
Chitta does not have a location point in the body, it is psychological
in nature, but it is controlled by the information supplied by
the]{.class-0} [indriyas]{.class5827-1} [or senses. While chitta is
being constantly supplied with information, its evolution is blocked,
but if you prevent the passage of information from the indriyas, chitta
will evolve very quickly. That is to say, if you isolate chitta from the
information being relayed through the eyes, nose, ears, skin and tongue,
chitta is then compelled to experience independence. When the
cerebrospinal fluid is affected during pranayama, the senses become dull
and their messages are relayed to chitta very slowly. Sometimes, when
the cerebrospinal fluid is highly stimulated, all sensory impulses are
suspended and experiences take place within the chitta. Sometimes these
experiences are fantastic, you might see light, feel the whole earth
trembling or experience your body as if it were as light as a piece of
cotton. These and others are the experiences of chitta as a consequence
of the cerebrospinal fluid's reactions.]{.class-0}

Mantra
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The second method of awakening kundalini is through steady regular
practice of mantra. This is a very powerful, smooth and risk-free
method, but of course it is a sadhana which requires time and a lot of
patience. First you need to obtain a suitable mantra from a guru who
knows yoga and tantra, and who can guide you through your sadhana. When
you practise the mantra incessantly, it develops in you the vision of a
higher force and enables you to live amidst the sensualities of life
with indifference to them.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When you throw a pebble into a still lake, it produces circular
ripples. In the same way, when you repeat a mantra over and over again,
the sound force gathers momentum and creates vibrations in the ocean of
the mind. When you repeat the mantra millions and billions of times, it
permeates every part of your brain and purifies your whole physical,
mental and emotional body.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The mantra must be chanted loudly, softly, on the mental plane and on
the psychic plane. By practising it at these four levels, kundalini
awakens methodically and systematically. You can also use the mantra by
repeating it mentally in coordination with the breath, or you can sing
it aloud in the form of kirtan. This creates a great potential in
mooladhara and awakening takes place.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Closely related to mantra yoga is awakening through sound or music --
nada yoga. Here the sounds are the beeja mantras and the music consists
of particular melodies corresponding to particular chakras. This is a
most tender and absorbing way of awakening.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Tapasya
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The third method of awakening is [tapasya]{.class5827-0} , which means
the performance of austerities. Tapasya is a means of purification, a
burning or setting on fire so that a process []{#part0014.xhtml_page_40}
of elimination is created, not in the physical body, but in the mental
and emotional bodies. Through this process the mind, the emotions and
the whole personality are cleansed of all the dirt, complexes and the
patterns of behaviour that cause pain and suffering. Tapasya is an act
of purification. It should not be misunderstood to involve standing
naked in cold water or snow, or observing foolish and meaningless
austerities.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When you want to eliminate a bad habit, the more you try, the more
powerful it becomes. When you abandon it in the waking state, it appears
in dreams, and when you stop those dreams, it expresses itself in your
behaviour or manifests in disease. This particular habit must be
destroyed at its psychic root, not only at the conscious level. The
samskaras and vasanas must be eliminated by some form of
tapasya.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Tapasya is a psychological or psycho-emotional process through which
the aspirant tries to set in motion a process of metabolism that will
eradicate the habits that create weakness and obstruct the awakening of
willpower. "I must do this but I can't." Why does this difference
between resolution and implementation arise in the mind of the aspirant?
Why is it so great? It is due to a deficiency of will, and that
weakness, that distance or barrier between resolution and execution can
be removed through regular and repeated practice of tapasya. Then the
willpower makes a decision once and the matter is finished. This
strength of will is the fruit of tapasya.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The psychology of austerity plays a very important part in the
awakening of man's latent power. It is not well understood by modern man
who has unfortunately accepted that man lives for the pleasure
principle, as propounded by Freud and his disciples. The psychology of
austerity is very sound and certainly not abnormal. When the senses are
satisfied by the objective pleasures, by the comforts and luxuries, the
brain and nervous system become weak and the consciousness and energy
undergo a process of regression. It is in this situation that the method
of austerity is one of the most powerful and sometimes explosive methods
of awakening.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {#part0014.xhtml_page_41 .class179 lang="en-us"}
[Here the manifestations are tremendous and the aspirant has to face his
lower instincts in the beginning. He confronts a lot of temptations and
the assaults of the satanic and tamasic forces. All the evil or negative
samskaras or karmas of many, many incarnations rise to the surface.
Sometimes fear manifests very powerfully or attachment to the world
comes with a great force. In some people, sexual fantasies haunt the
mind for days together, while others become lean and thin, or even sick.
At this juncture, siddhis can appear. One develops extrasensory
perceptions, one can read the minds of others, and can suppress others
by a thought, or one's own thoughts materialize. In the beginning, black
forces manifest and all these siddhis are negative or of a lower
quality. Tapasya is a very, very powerful method of awakening which not
everybody can handle.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Awakening through herbs
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The fourth method of awakening is through the use of specific herbs. In
Sanskrit this is called [aushadhi]{.class5827-0} , and it should not be
interpreted as meaning drugs like marijuana, LSD, and so on. Aushadhi is
the most powerful and rapid method of awakening, but it is not for all
and very few people know about it. There are herbs which can transform
the nature of the body and its elements and bring about either partial
or full awakening, but they should never be used without a guru or
qualified guide. This is because certain herbs selectively awaken ida or
pingala and others can suppress both these nadis and quickly lead one to
the mental asylum. For this reason, aushadhi is a very risky and
unreliable method for awakening.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In the ancient vedic texts of India, there are references to a
substance called soma. Soma was a juice extracted from a creeper which
was picked on special days of the dark lunar fortnight. It was placed in
an earthen pitcher and buried underground until the full moon. Then it
was removed and the juice was extracted and taken. This induced visions,
experiences and an awakening of higher consciousness.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {#part0014.xhtml_page_42 .class179 lang="en-us"}
[The Persians knew of another drink, homa, which may have been the same
as soma. In Brazil and some of the African countries, people used
hallucinogenic mushrooms and in the Himalayan regions marijuana or
hashish were taken with the thought that they might provide a shortcut
in arousing spiritual awakening. From time to time, in different parts
of the world, other things were also discovered and used, some being
very mild in effect and others being very concentrated.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[With the help of the correct herbs, purified aspirants were able to
visualize divine beings, holy rivers, mountains, sacred places, holy
people and so on. When the effects of the herbs were more concentrated,
they could separate the self from the body and travel astrally. Of
course, it was often illusory, but sometimes it was a real experience as
well. People were able to enter a state of samadhi and awaken their
kundalini. In this particular field of awakening, the sexual instinct
was completely eliminated. Therefore, many aspirants preferred this
method and have been trying to discover the appropriate herbs for many
centuries.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[With aushadhi awakening, the body becomes still and quiet, the
metabolism slows and the temperature drops. As a result of this, the
nerve reflexes function differently and in most cases the aushadhi
method of awakening is no longer practised because it was misused by
ordinary people who were neither prepared, competent nor qualified. As a
result, knowledge of the herbs was withdrawn and today it is a closely
guarded secret.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Everyone is craving kundalini awakening, but few people have the
discipline and mental, emotional, physical and nervous preparation
required to avoid damage to the brain and tissues. So, although no one
is teaching the aushadhi method of awakening today, its knowledge has
been transmitted from generation to generation through the guru-disciple
tradition. Perhaps some day, when the nature of man changes and we find
better intellectual, physical and mental responses, the science may
again be revealed.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {#part0014.xhtml_page_43 .class185 lang="en-us"}
Raja yoga
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The fifth method of inducing awakening is through raja yoga and the
development of an equipoised mind. This is the total merging of
individual consciousness with superconsciousness. It occurs by a
sequential process of concentration, meditation and communion;
experience of union with the absolute or supreme.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[All the practices of raja yoga, preceded by hatha yoga, bring about
very mild and durable experiences, but they can lead to a state of
complete depression, in which you do not feel like doing anything. The
raja yoga method is very difficult for the majority of people as it
requires time, patience, discipline and perseverance. Concentration of
mind is one of the most difficult things for people of today to achieve.
It cannot be undertaken before the mind has been stabilized, the karmas
deactivated and the emotions purified through the practices of karma
yoga and bhakti yoga. It is the nature of the mind to remain active all
the time, and this constitutes a very real danger for people of our
time, because when we try to concentrate the mind we create a split.
Therefore, the majority of us should only practise concentration up to a
certain point.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Following awakening through raja yoga, changes take place in the
aspirant. One may transcend hunger and all addictions or habits. The
sensualities of life are no longer appealing, hunger and the sexual urge
diminish and detachment develops spontaneously. Raja yoga brings about a
slow transformation of consciousness.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Pranayama
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The sixth method of awakening kundalini is through pranayama. When a
sufficiently prepared aspirant practises intense pranayama in a calm,
cool and quiet environment, preferably at a high altitude, with a diet
only sufficient to maintain life, the awakening of kundalini takes place
like an explosion. In fact, the awakening is so rapid that kundalini
ascends to sahasrara immediately.
:::

::: {#part0014.xhtml_page_44 .class179 lang="en-us"}
[Pranayama is not only a breathing exercise or a means to increase prana
in the body; it is a powerful method of creating yogic fire to heat the
kundalini and awaken it. However, if it is practised without sufficient
preparation, this will not occur because the generated heat will not be
directed to the proper centres. Therefore, jalandhara, uddiyana and
moola bandhas are practised to lock the prana in and force it up to the
frontal brain.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When pranayama is practised correctly, the mind is automatically
conquered. However, the effects of pranayama are not that simple to
manage. It creates extra heat in the body, it awakens some of the
centres in the brain and it can hinder the production of sperm and
testosterone. Pranayama may also lower the temperature of the inner body
and even bring down the rate of respiration and alter the brain waves.
Unless you have practised the shatkarmas first and purified the body to
a degree, when these changes take place, you may not be able to handle
them.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[There are two important ways of awakening kundalini -- the direct
method and the indirect. Pranayama is the direct method. The experiences
it brings about are explosive and results are attained very quickly.
Expansion is rapid and the mind attains quick metamorphosis. However,
this form of kundalini awakening is always accompanied by certain
experiences, and for one who is not sufficiently prepared mentally,
philosophically, physically and emotionally, these experiences can be
terrifying. Therefore, although the path of pranayama is a jetset
method, it is drastic and is considered to be a very difficult one that
everybody cannot manage.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Kriya yoga
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The seventh method of inducing awakening is kriya yoga. It is the most
simple and practical way for the modern day individual as it does not
require confrontation with the mind. Sattwic people may be able to
awaken kundalini through raja yoga, but those who have a tumultuous,
noisy, rajasic mind will not succeed this way. They will only develop
[]{#part0014.xhtml_page_45} more tensions, guilt and complexes, and may
even become schizophrenic. For such people kriya yoga is by far the best
and most effective system.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When you practise kriya yoga, kundalini does not wake up with force,
nor does it awaken like a satellite or as a vision or experience. It
wakes up like a noble queen. Before getting up she will open her eyes,
then close them again for a while. Then she will open her eyes again,
look here and there, turn to the right and left, then pull the sheet up
over her head and doze. After some time she will again stretch her body
and open her eyes, then doze for a while. Each time she stretches and
looks around she says, "Hmmm." This is what happens in kriya yoga
awakening.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Sometimes you feel very grand and sometimes you do not feel quite
right. Sometimes you pay too much attention to the things of life and
sometimes you think everything is useless. Sometimes you eat
extravagantly and sometimes you do not eat for days together. Sometimes
you have sleepless nights and at other times you do nothing but sleep
and sleep. All these signs of awakening and reversion, awakening and
reversion keep coming every now and then. Kriya yoga does not create an
explosive awakening. However, it can bring visions and other very mild
and controllable experiences.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Tantric initiation
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
This eighth method of awakening kundalini through tantric initiation is
a very secret topic. Only those people who have transcended passions,
and who understand the two principles of nature, Shiva and Shakti, are
entitled to this initiation. It is not meant for those who have urges
lurking within them or for those who have a need for physical contact.
With the guidance of a guru, this is the quickest possible way to awaken
kundalini.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[There are no extraordinary experiences or feelings and there is no
neurosis; everything seems quite normal, but at the same time, without
your knowledge, awakening is]{.class-0} []{#part0014.xhtml_page_46

expands, but you do not know it. In this particular system, awakening
and arriving at sahasrara are the same event. It takes just three
seconds. However, who is qualified for this path? Few people in this
world have completely transcended the sexual urge and overcome their
passions.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Shaktipat
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The ninth method of awakening is performed by the guru. It is called
shaktipat. The awakening is instant, but it is only a glimpse, not a
permanent event. When the guru creates this awakening you experience
samadhi. You can practise all forms of pranayama and all asanas, mudras
and bandhas without having learned them or prepared for them. All the
mantras are revealed to you and you know the scriptures from within.
Changes take place in the physical body in an instant. The skin becomes
very soft, the eyes glow and the body emits a particular aroma which is
neither agreeable nor disagreeable.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[This shaktipat can be conducted in the physical presence or from a
distance. It can be transmitted by touch, by a handkerchief, a mala, a
flower, a fruit or anything edible, depending on the system the guru has
mastered. It can even be transmitted by letter, telegram or
telephone.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[It is very difficult to say who is qualified for this awakening. You
may have lived the life of a renunciate for fifty years, but still you
may not get it. You may be just an ordinary person, living a
non-spiritual life, eating all kinds of junk foods, but the guru may
give you shaktipat. Your eligibility for shaktipat does not depend on
your social or immediate conduct, but on the point of evolution you have
reached. There is a point in evolution beyond which shaktipat becomes
effective, but this evolution is not intellectual, emotional, social or
religious. It is a spiritual evolution which has nothing to do with the
way we live, eat, behave or think, because generally we do these things
not because of our evolvement, but according to the way we have been
brought up and educated.]{.class-0}

Self-surrender
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
We have discussed the nine established methods of awakening kundalini,
but there is a tenth way -- do not aspire for awakening. Let it happen
if it happens: "I am not responsible for the awakening, nature is
accomplishing everything. I accept what comes to me." This is known as
the path of self-surrender, and in this path, if you have a strong
enough belief that your kundalini will indeed awaken, twenty thousand
years can pass in the twinkling of an eye and kundalini will awaken
instantly.
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Effects of the different methods of awakening
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
When the awakening of kundalini takes place, scientific observations
have revealed different effects. Those who have awakened kundalini from
birth do not register any emotional changes. They are like blocks of
wood. Those who have awakened kundalini through pranayama have a great
quantum of electrical charges in the spinal column and throughout the
body, and momentarily they could manifest schizophrenically in an
individual.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Karma yoga and bhakti yoga are considered comparatively safe and mild
methods of awakening, but the tantric methods are more scientific than
the non-tantric methods, because in tantra there is no scope for
suppression or dispersion of energy. In non-tantric methods there is
antagonism; one part of the mind wants it and another part of the same
mind is saying no. You suppress your thoughts, you want to enjoy, but at
the same time you think, "No, it is bad."]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class202 lang="en-us"}
[I am not criticizing non-tantric methods. They are the mild methods
which do not bring you any trouble. They are just like beer, you drink a
little bit and nothing happens. If you drink four to ten glasses not
much will happen. But tantric methods are like LSD, you have a little
and it takes you right out. If something is wrong, it is wrong; if
something is right, it is right.]{.class-0}

evolve a more intimate attitude, as if your relationship was based on
love, not merely devotion and worship. When you serve your mother you do

most important point. Man is aware of his awareness and he does not only

not necessarily to awaken kundalini. First of all, we have to decide
whether kundalini is already awakened. It may already be on the way and
you are opening the garage and there is no car because it is already on
the highway. When you go to satsang, do some kirtan or lead a yogic
lifestyle, you begin to have experiences and you realize something is
happening to you. Then, when you discuss kundalini and the chakras with
a guru you start to understand.

no real use. If you are practising, it is because you are forced to, and
if you are not practising, it is because you are forced not to. During
the period of transition of kundalini the practices are not useless, but
your efforts to practise them are of no use. However, if there is no
awakening, if kundalini is in mooladhara or swadhisthana or in between
the two, then that is the time for the practices which are enjoined in
the books.]{.class-0}

Awakening before preparation
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
If experiences commence before you are properly prepared, you should
immediately start to prepare yourself. The first thing to do is start
fasting or switch to a light diet. You should also live quietly and
avoid social interactions, reading books and magazines. Of course,
during this period you []{#part0015.xhtml_page_53} must not take any
drugs or medicines and you must guard against introducing any chemicals
into the body.

normal life. You should then start searching for someone who can give
you further guidance.]{.class-0}

Proceed to an ashram
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
When you know that kundalini is arousing, as soon as you can, you should
retire to a congenial place. As far as I know, the only congenial place
is an ashram, where you can be with a guru and like-minded people. An
ashram is a community where the inmates have plenty of work, no
attachments, no hatred or prejudices, a simple life, little to eat, no
comforts or luxuries, only the bare essentials. There are no social
expectations and pressures in an ashram, no fashion, no show, no useless
conversations, no interference and gossip.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[If you live in an ashram, the awakening of kundalini can be streamlined
and if a mental crisis occurs, you are free to experience whatever
happens. If you do not want to eat, it is okay; if you cannot sleep and
you just want to sit, it is all right; if you have emotional problems or
no emotions at all, people will understand and leave you
alone.]{.class-0}

[If you stay with your family during the crisis period, they may send
you off to a mental hospital. If you do not feel like eating, they will
say, "Not eating today?" When they see you have not eaten for a few
days, they will say, "Something is wrong with her," and they will try to
get you to see a doctor or psychiatrist. Or if you are married, when
your behaviour seems a little strange, your partner might be ready to
divorce you. So it is much better to get away from such places. That is
why there are so many monasteries and ashrams all over the world
today.]{.class-0}

:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In the ashram you should practise purification of the physical body
through the shatkarmas to balance the []{#part0015.xhtml_page_54} acid,
wind and mucus in the body. Physical and mental purification will also
take place on account of the pure and simple ashram diet. The physical
body must be kept very, very light and made sattwic and entirely free of
toxins.

[If you are a bhakta by temperament, spend your time in prayer, singing
kirtan or bhajan. If you are an intellectual, then read books, talk
minimally, practise hatha yoga and fast from time to time. If you are a
very active person, work hard and dedicate yourself to karma
yoga.]{.class-0}

[Some people think they should practise a lot of meditation or pranayama
when kundalini is ascending so it will go straight to sushumna. However,
I do not think meditation is necessary anymore, because when kundalini
is in the process of transition, you can do nothing with your mind. If
your mind is agitated, you can do nothing about it because that is the
effect of the awakening of kundalini. It is not the effect of your
practice.]{.class-0}

exhausted, awareness must be extended to every level, dedication or

possible without doing karma yoga.]{.class-0}

Some people who have awakened kundalini look quite abnormal, and they
behave in a peculiar way. They are very disorganized, unsystematic and
totally confused, and you cannot understand what they are doing.
Therefore, in yoga you are advised to discipline yourself right from the
beginning, so that when kundalini wakes up you remain disciplined.
Otherwise you might go out to the street and just lie down there in a

If the awakening of kundalini takes place through birth, pranayama,

or wrong; you are helpless. But when awakening takes place through the
other methods, there are certain steps to take.

[Often when kundalini awakens the person develops some sort of power.
Some aspirants can materialize things, see clairvoyantly, hear
clairaudiently or read the minds of others. When you are amongst many
people, it becomes a great temptation to exercise these powers. This can
be dangerous. Whereas some people will not care if you can read their
mind, others will feel it is a great impingement on their privacy and
may even want to shoot you. People get scared at the exhibition of

to control them by force.]{.class-0}

Awakening by mantra and the need for seclusion
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
When awakening takes place by mantra, you will have to adjust your diet
and retire from sexual obligations, not permanently, but for a while.
From time to time it is also beneficial if you enter total seclusion.
Twice a year is sufficient. In the beginning, start with one complete
day, then increase to three days, and when you are used to it, extend to
a maximum period of nine days. It is preferable if you practise
seclusion when it is neither too hot nor too cold.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[During your first day of seclusion, observe silence and eat very light
food and very little. Do not meditate or try to concentrate. From
morning until evening, with a few breaks here and there, only practise
your mantra on a mala. Do not do it with exertion or strain, and if you
become introverted, stop it. Maintain your mental concept with the
external experiences; do not aspire for an introverted meditative state.
If introversion forces itself, keep your eyes open. Practise this for
twelve hours, but not in one stretch. For the last hour you must sit in
meditation.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Next time you go into seclusion, do so for three to nine days. During
this period devote as much time as possible to the repetition,
resolution and reflection of the mantra. On the last day, at the end of
the process, sit quietly for one hour of meditation.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Seclusion is actually recommended for all who are undergoing awakening
of kundalini. At that time it is best to retire from active life and
family environments for at least forty-five days. Unless you are in

having strange experiences and hallucinations, you may have peculiar
doubts, fears, anger and strong passions.]{.class-0}

it is important to have the correct diet, as food influences the mind
and your nature. At the time of awakening, certain physiological changes
occur in the body, particularly in the digestive system, and the
digestive process is frequently disturbed, or hunger vanishes
completely. Therefore, a kundalini aspirant has to be very careful about
his diet.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Scientific observations have shown that the awakening of kundalini is
generally accompanied by a state of nervous depression. The inner body
temperature undergoes erratic changes and drops so much that it becomes
much lower than the outer body temperature. Metabolism slows down and
sometimes it even stops completely. Consumption of oxygen also falls.
Therefore, when you are experiencing kundalini awakening your diet must
be very light and easy to assimilate.]{.class-0}

Dietary misconceptions
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
A great misunderstanding has taken place in the last twenty to thirty
years, which is that a yogi should only take milk, fruit and raw
vegetables. On the basis of personal observation, trial and error, I
cannot accept that this is correct. There are certain foods which are
not meant for the human body at all.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[If you analyze your digestive and salivary secretions and the
durability of the mucous membranes in the alimentary canal, you will
find that they are not really meant for digesting meat and uncooked
foods. Whereas carnivorous animals have short intestines so that their
food can be expelled quickly, before fermentation takes place, we have
very long intestines (thirty-six feet in length) and our food should
take eighteen hours to pass through the body. As well cooked vegetarian
food is less likely to ferment, and we can keep it in our intestines for
a full eighteen hours, it is the best for the human digestive
tract.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Of course, this is not to say that people who have a non-vegetarian
diet cannot awaken their kundalini, as history indicates otherwise.
There have been many Christian, Tibetan and Sufi saints who awakened
their kundalini although they had a meat diet, and we cannot say what
Christ, Moses, Mohammed and Buddha ate. However, from scientific
observations made in the event of kundalini awakening, we know what is
likely to occur in our body. At certain periods we may not be able to
digest raw foods and there may be days when the body cannot even accept
water. Therefore, during the period of kundalini awakening, please have
a diet which can be easily assimilated and eat the bare minimum for
existence. Do not live to eat, but eat to live.]{.class-0}

The essence of food
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The food we eat is not merely to satisfy our taste. Every food item has
an essence in it, and in yoga we call this sattwa. Sattwa means the
ultimate essence of food, but please do not mistake this for vitamins or
minerals. Sattwa is the more subtle form of food. When you eat for the
sake of taste or enjoyment, instead of extracting the sattwa you only
get the gross things. This is why the yogis and saints of all traditions
have always lived on the minimum possible amount of food during periods
of sadhana.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When we overeat we create a burden for the digestive system, and when
the digestive system is overburdened we are unable to extract the sattwa
from the food. Sattwa is a substance which nourishes the thoughts and
nervous system. When the thoughts are fed with sattwa they are more
refined and pure, and one is able to live in higher consciousness.
Therefore, it is beneficial for a sadhaka to fast from time to time.
When the body is kept light and pure, it is far more capable of
extracting the sattwa from food.]{.class-0}

The use of condiments
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In the diet for kundalini aspirants, condiments have a very important
role to play. Condiments such as coriander, cumin seeds, turmeric,
aniseed, black pepper, green pepper, cayenne, cloves, mustard seed,
cardamom, cinnamon and so on are also called digestives, as they aid
digestion. These substances are not spices for taste; they are
condiments which have the same properties as the enzymes in the body,
and by helping to break down the food for digestion, they conserve vital
energy and help to maintain the body's internal temperature.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When we talk about diet, let us not do so in puritanical terms. We must
remember only one point in this case, to be sure the body is capable of
digesting all the food. Having made a thorough study of natural foods
and having tried them on myself, I have come to the conclusion that a
combination of natural and macrobiotic foods is best. I have]{.class-0}
[]{#part0016.xhtml_page_62 .class-0} [also discovered that instead of
cooking the food in your stomach, it is best to cook it properly in the
pan. Five or six condiments should be added during cooking to liberate
the enzymes and chemicals which enhance digestion. The combination of
heat, condiments and enzymes breaks down the food into smaller and more
basic components, making it easier to digest.]{.class-0}

Yoga and diet are independent sciences
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Although diet is an independent science, it is definitely related to
every system of yoga. Of course, the ideal diet varies from yoga to
yoga. A hatha yogi who has been practising shankhaprakshalana will not
be able to eat lots of red peppers and black peppers or he will die. The
diet regime for a karma yoga, a bhakta yogi, raja yogi, hatha yogi and
kriya yogi will not be the same.

[A bhakta yogi can eat all types of sweets and confectionery, consume
cheese, butter, milk, etc. and he can eat and eat because his metabolism
is very fast. Similarly, a karma yogi can take cheese, coffee, raw food
or cooked food, and even a little bit of champagne, because he is
working hard physically and his metabolism is also very fast. But in
raja yoga and kundalini awakening, the metabolism becomes slow and you
have to be very careful about your diet and how much you
consume.]{.class-0}

have evolved two wonderful foods which suit everybody. One is for those
who like rice and the other is for those who prefer wheat. You either
cook the rice with dal (pulses such as lentils), vegetables and a few
condiments, or you pound the wheat, add all the same ingredients to that

than you will encounter on the path of kundalini. Every time you walk
across the street or travel by car or plane, you take a risk. In the

every day without thinking twice about it. Yet they allow the relatively
minor risk of kundalini to deter them from pursuing the supreme goal of
higher consciousness.

about in []{#part0017.xhtml_page_67} mooladhara and all the instincts of
that chakra will develop. You will become a high class animal for a

pranic nadi, pingala, it could set the whole brain into turmoil.

In the course of your practices there may be isolated awakenings in ajna
chakra, in which the awareness enters the realms of the unconscious mind
and you see figures, symbols and even monsters or benevolent beings. You
may hear or experience many inexplicable things, but they are all simply
products of your own unconscious mind and should be regarded as nothing
more. With the awakening of psychic consciousness, the symbols belonging
to your own personality come out. When this happens you may have a
problem understanding it, but just remember that these kinds of
expressions are simply parts of your being which have been lying in

yourself in the calibre of chela or disciple. A disciple remains a

that person will destroy himself, and possibly many others in the

spoke the truth without fear of society. Joan of Arc and the witches of
Salem were burned at the stake, as were many others. All have been
persecuted and harassed by the mundane populace for their vision, which
arose as a result of inner work. Due to this lack of understanding, many
of the esoteric doctrines were hidden from the majority of people.

are 'better'. Yet, by what criteria are they judged insane? How do we
know the difference between insanity and the ecstasy of enlightenment?
Is it by the superficial external appearances that we sense with our
limited sensory apparatus, or is it by some deeper inner fear that we
are motivated to judge others insane because they do not behave like the
majority? Some of the people in the west who are locked up as insane

Spiritual experiences in the East and West
:::

Knowledge of spiritual experience has been lost in the West. During the
last few centuries, many unfortunate people whose kundalini had awakened
were sent to mental hospitals and given drugs, electric shocks and other
inappropriate treatments. The scientists and doctors believed that the
[]{#part0018.xhtml_page_74} awakening was an abnormal kind of behaviour,
and no one was able to accept or handle it, not even the person's
immediate family or closest friends. That is why in the last two hundred
years, there have been so few great personalities in the west; they have
all been committed to mental hospitals or they have remained quiet to
avoid that fate.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In India, the situation is quite different. There, when an individual
expresses some abnormal symptoms, makes some very peculiar gestures or
speaks of extraordinary dreams, it is understood that he is experiencing
events beyond the mind. The Hindu belief is that the consciousness is
not the finished product of nature, but is subject to evolution, and
between one state of being and the next, there is a crisis. When strange
symptoms occur in someone, it is believed that his consciousness is
undergoing evolution. If a child's total personality is devoted to God
and he can experience things beyond the mind, then his whole family is
purified and such a child is universally respected.]{.class-0}

develop. Fantasies can take form and one's own psychological volition

[A mad person does not have a constant and consistent flow of experience
and his awareness is very dissipated. He is both disorganized externally

person who is awakened is constant and consistent. Whereas a person with
an awakened consciousness can make accurate decisions and judgements, a
crazy person cannot. Madness and spiritual awakening may both be
characterized by a certain lack of control, but the spiritually awakened
person is guided by a higher consciousness while the mad person is
not.]{.class-0}

[When some supra-sensual experience is taking place, it is important to
consult an experienced person who has knowledge of illumination and also
knows about madness. A guru can make the correct judgement and determine
whether the brain has begun a process of regression or is actually
progressing along transcendental lines. If there is some organic damage
in the brain, it can be treated, but if the symptoms are spiritual, the
person is initiated and given something to practise so his behaviour is
streamlined. He or she will not be forced into married life or any other
of the social roles which are unsuitable. Instead, he will be exposed to
saintly personalities and teachings.]{.class-0}

Step 1: Disciplining ida and pingala
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Ida and pingala nadis are responsible for the mundane existence. Pingala
conducts the life that is in your body and ida conducts the
consciousness. These two nadis respectively feed the two hemispheres of
the brain, which in turn control every activity of the body. It is not
awakening of these nadis we aim towards, but discipline. As you know,
ida and pingala function alternately and directly influence the
temperature of the body, digestive and hormonal secretions, the brain
waves and all the bodily systems.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Ida and pingala function according to a natural cycle, but on account
of poor eating habits and inharmonious lifestyles, the natural cycle is
often disturbed. Sometimes one nadi predominates and the other is
suppressed, which leads to mental and physical imbalances and generally
results in disease. Therefore, ida and pingala must be disciplined or
made to function according to the laws of nature. Only when there is
harmony between these two nadis can sushumna be awakened.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[So, through the practices of hatha yoga, pranayama and raja yoga, the
nadis should be purified and disciplined. The best practice for this is
nadi shodhana pranayama, the nadi purifying pranayama.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Step 2: Awakening the chakras
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
From incarnation to incarnation the yoga we have been practising may
have already awakened the lower chakras. []{#part0019.xhtml_page_78}
Although most of us try to awaken mooladhara, swadhisthana etc. it may
not be necessary to awaken them because we may have evolved even beyond
manipura on account of our efforts in a previous life. It is even
possible that kundalini may have ascended through the chakras, but we do
not know it because we have not noticed any symptoms. However, in any
case, it is essential that all the chakras must be awakened before we
make an attempt to awaken sushumna.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[If the chakras are not purified, then purification of the nadis will
not serve any purpose. If the electrical junctions are not connected or
properly organized, even if you have the best wiring available, how will
the electrical energy be distributed? The chakras are the junctions from
which the nadis, like cables, transmit the energy to different parts of
the body.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Every point, speck or fibre of the body is directly related to one of
the chakras. If you experience pain in any part of the body, the
sensation will go to the chakras related to that particular area. This
means your whole body is connected to the chakras. For example, the
urinary, excretory and reproductive systems are fed by swadhisthana
chakra. Besides this, the sexual organs are connected to mooladhara
chakra. The digestive system, small intestine, large intestine,
appendix, pancreas, duodenum, stomach and liver are all connected to
manipura chakra. The heart and lungs are fed by anahata
chakra.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[However, in most people, the chakras beyond manipura are dormant.
Because mooladhara chakra is the highest chakra in animal evolution, it
is already functioning in most people. That is why everybody has a very
acute sexual awareness and sex has become one of the most important
events in man's life. Therefore, most of our social traditions are based
upon this particular human requirement. The mere fact that today's
society is utilizing the five tattwas of tantra (meat, fish, wine, grain
and sexual interaction) in everyday life means that in most people,
kundalini is somewhere between mooladhara and swadhisthana.
Once]{.class-0} []{#part0019.xhtml_page_79 .class-0} [kundalini leaves
swadhisthana and ascends to manipura and anahata, you no longer need the
five tattwas.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[If you are stuck in mooladhara or swadhisthana chakra, you will need to
purify the higher chakras and bring them into operation. There are many
ways of doing it. For those who are strong in mind, there are some
higher practices. By concentration on bhrumadhya you can awaken one
chakra, by the practice of uddiyana bandha you can awaken another, by
practising mantra, your mantra or any beeja mantra, you can awaken
almost all the chakras one by one, and as a result of this awakening,
you can have very good psychic experiences which you can easily handle.
In my opinion, it is safer to awaken the chakras by the mild
methods.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The asanas are intended to create mild awakening in the chakras. For
example, sarvangasana will awaken vishuddhi, matsyasana will awaken
anahata, and bhujangasana will awaken swadhisthana. By awakening the
chakras mildly, you will not have any jolting experiences. Sometimes,
when a chakra awakens suddenly, you can have the experience of lower
lives. This means you can be assailed by fear, anxiety, greed, passion,
depression, and so on.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Each chakra is symbolized by a certain animal, indicating a type of
animal consciousness, and if sudden awakening of a chakra takes place,
you may exhibit some of the animal emotions in either a mild or very
strong way. For instance, fear is not a human emotion, nor is
infatuation or violence. Of course, man is trying to expel the animal
from himself, but at the same time he is maintaining it. Therefore, care
must be taken not to give an explosive manifestation to the awakening of
the chakras.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Step 3: Awakening sushumna
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In order to purify and awaken sushumna, a lot of work has to be done and
you must be ready to cope with experiences that are more intense than
those associated with chakra awakening. These experiences are beyond
logic. They are not even real and they cannot be explained or properly
[]{#part0019.xhtml_page_80} understood. If the chakras are awakened, ida
and pingala are balanced and the other nadis are also purified, but
there is an obstruction in sushumna, then the awakening of kundalini
will not fulfil its purpose.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Actually, I do not believe that ida and pingala nadis are inferior to
sushumna. Awakening of pingala nadi will awaken one portion of the brain
and awakening of ida will awaken another portion. However, when
kundalini enters sushumna, it affects the whole brain.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In the ancient texts of tantra it has been clearly indicated that it
does not matter if kundalini enters another passageway. If there is an
awakening in pingala, one becomes a healer or a siddha, one who has
control over nature, matter and the mind. When there is awakening in
ida, one can predict things; one becomes a prophet. But when sushumna
awakens, kundalini ascends straight to sahasrara and one becomes a
jivanmukta, a liberated soul.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class202 lang="en-us"}
[So, hatha yoga and pranayama are prescribed for the awakening of
sushumna. There are also other ways, but kriya yoga is the best,
particularly the practices of maha mudra and maha bheda mudra. For
awakening of sushumna, ida and pingala have to be suppressed. Thus you
can see the importance of practising kumbhaka, breath retention. When
both nadis are suppressed in kumbhaka, immediately after you will find
that both nadis are flowing simultaneously. It is at this time that
kundalini should awaken.]{.class-0}

When Shiva and Shakti unite in sahasrara, one experiences samadhi,
illumination occurs in the brain and the silent areas begin to function.
Shiva and Shakti remain merged together for some time, during which
there is a total loss of consciousness pertaining to each other. At that
time a bindu evolves. Bindu means a point, a drop, and that bindu is the
substratum of the whole cosmos. Within that bindu is the seat of human
intelligence and the seat of the total creation. Then the bindu splits
into two and Shiva and Shakti manifest again in duality. When ascension
took place it was only the ascent of Shakti, but when descent takes
place, Shiva and Shakti both descend to the gross plane and there is

When one attains the highest pinnacles of samadhi, purusha and prakriti,

experience, exists. At this time, when there is no subject/object plus
distinction, it is very difficult for one to differentiate. He may look
like an idiot and not know it, or he may appear to be a great scholar
and not be aware of that. He does not know whether he is talking to a
man or a woman, he sees no difference between them. He may even be
associating with spiritual or divine people without being aware of that,
because at this point of time his consciousness is reduced to a level of
innocence just like that of a baby.

How is your child? Is he sick? Are you giving him medicine? Why do you

mahatmas talk about charity, compassion, love, and so on. However, there
is a period when they do not understand these things and they do not
care what happens to the world. They do not even know what is going on,
who is happy and who is suffering. Finally, however, there is a great
transformation. Shakti rules matter and Shiva rules consciousness, and

[T]{.class220-kfx-dropcap} he awakening of kundalini is like a great
explosion which transports a person into another plane of being. No
matter which spiritual path you follow, you must eventually reach this
domain. Ordinary consciousness and transcendental consciousness cannot
be maintained at the same time; it is necessary to pass through an
intermediate zone of change, where perceptions, feelings and experiences
undergo a transformation. The adventure is always the same; it is a
journey through the border region between the known and the unknown.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[At this time it is very important to recognize that this explosion
signals a profound alteration in consciousness. The complete process of
awakening is comprised of several stages, as the kundalini rises and
passes through the various chakras. It takes quite some time to become
fully stabilized, but if one has a good understanding, the transition
process can be managed without any serious difficulties.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The preliminary awakening of kundalini is followed by the experience of
light in bhrumadhya. Usually this develops in a very mild way over an
extended period of time and, therefore, does not precipitate any sudden
agitation or disturbance. After some time, the appetite for food and
sleep gradually decreases and the mind becomes quieter.]{.class-0}

An onslaught of experiences
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
When the actual awakening occurs there is an explosion in the realm of
experience and there are symptoms which are sometimes very difficult to
understand. The most unique and common experience is the release of
energy like an electric shock from the bottom of the spinal cord, as if
it were connected to an electrical power point. This may be accompanied
by a burning sensation in mooladhara chakra and energy passing up and
down through sushumna. Sometimes you hear drums, flutes, bells, birds,
celestial music, or you may even think you can hear peacocks singing.
You may have a very momentary sensation of sitting outside in the middle
of a monsoon shower, and there can also be the sensation of dark clouds
in continual movement overhead and the sound of thunder.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[At times your body feels so light and you may even visualize your
spinal cord as fluorescent light. It is common to feel illumination from
within, as if hundreds of little lights were burning inside your body.

suppressions come out. Sometimes you are so filled with fear that you
cannot sleep, sometimes for days together you have nothing in your mind

these symptoms pass within a few days or weeks.]{.class-0}

There is a detachment from the normal emotions of life; for days you may
live a life of utter dispassion. Nothing is interesting in life and
everything and everybody seems as dry as a desert. But at the same time,
the mind becomes very dynamic and appears to be formless. Various
sensations, poetic emotions and artistic perceptions also occur, such as
visions of angels and divinities. All kinds of things can emerge from

Headaches and insomnia

Some aspirants experience terrible headaches when kundalini is
awakening, however, this does not mean that all headaches are related to
kundalini, and not everybody will have headaches. Generally, those who
have had a married life do not have this experience. It is usually only
those who have not had any kind of sexual interactions who experience
headaches with the advent of kundalini awakening.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[There is also another explanation about headaches. One-tenth of the
brain is active and nine-tenths are not. In some cases, when the silent
areas of the brain begin to wake up, the first symptom is headache.
People have equated this experience with labour pain. Just as a woman
experiences labour pain when she is about to give birth to a child, when
the silent areas of the brain are about to become active and you are
giving birth to spiritual consciousness, there is also pain. Therefore,
one has to bear with this pain for some]{.class-0}

settle down. Of course, you can reduce the pain by adjusting your diet
and lifestyle, but under no circumstances should you use sedatives,
aspirins or pain relieving pills.]{.class-0}

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[It is also likely that an aspirant will experience insomnia. However,
yogis do not call it insomnia. They say, "Why should I sleep?" If you
love a person very much and he stays with you and does not allow you to
sleep, will you call that insomnia? So, not all those who do not sleep
are yogis. There are yogis who do not sleep and are happy about it
because yogis have an entirely different attitude. They say one-third of
life is wasted in sleeping.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[So, when kundalini awakens in a yogi and consciousness is constant and
consistent, and there is no waking, sleeping and dreaming, they are very
happy about it. Therefore, insomnia does not usually bother a person who
has awakened kundalini. However, if you are disturbed by your inability
to sleep, you should never resort to sleeping pills or tranquillizers.
It is also not necessary that you practise yoga to induce sleep. Just
accept your sleeplessness and enjoy it. You can do japa or meditation or
just do some spiritual reflection. If this is not possible, just lie
down and let it happen as it will.]{.class-0}

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Experiencing the threefold awakenings
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Each of the three forms of awakening -- nadis, chakras and sushumna is
accompanied by its own set of experiences. Many aspirants have psychic
experiences and think that these indicate the awakening of kundalini,
but this is not so.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When the chakras are awakening, the experiences one has are not so
frightening and critical. They are usually of a fantastic nature, very
pleasant, hallucinatory and comfortable. Even if you have an experience
of fear or terror, it does not shake your mind. When you have
experiences of your ishta devata or guru, or you have some experience in
meditation or during kirtan, and it feels very nice, that represents
chakra awakening and not kundalini awakening.]{.class-0}
[]{#part0021.xhtml_page_90 .class-0} [When you experience a chakra
awakening it is rather beautiful and leaves a comfortable or blissful
feeling. That is to encourage you to go further.]{.class-0}

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When awakening takes place in sushumna, you may feel or see a rod of
light, or your spinal cord may seem to be fully illumined from within.
Such experiences are described by saints of different religions in their
poems, songs and stories, which are unfortunately understood by very few
people today.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The awakening of sushumna can also bring some mind exploding
experiences which are sometimes very confusing. You can smell pleasant
and unpleasant odours, you will hear shrieks and screams as if ghosts
are crying, and there is a feeling of heat, creeping sensations and pain
in different parts of the body. You may get a high fever or manifest the
symptoms of some common disease or some baffling illness which medical
experts find difficult to analyze.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[At the time of sushumna awakening, the quality and experience of the
mind begin to change. One has the experience of depression, anorexia and
loneliness. You begin to realize the inner essence. Matter appears to be
nothing, and even your body feels as if it were only made up of air. Or
you may feel that you are not part of this physical body, you are
someone else. When you look at people, animals and the objects of nature
-- the flowers, trees, rivers and mountains, and so on, you feel a
communication with them.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[At this time, you also experience prophetic vision, but your visions or
forewarnings may not be clear and you only foresee the bad things --
imminent perils, accidents, disasters and catastrophes. Throughout the
awakening one generally has an aversion to work and cannot really apply
oneself to anything. It is actually best if an aspirant is near his guru
at this time of awakening so he can explain what is happening. The
sadhaka is not merely making a transition from one state of mind to
another, he is actually jumping from one state to another. It is also
very difficult for even an expert guru to handle these matters unless
the disciple has totally accepted him as his guru.]{.class-0}

Differentiating the experiences
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
You must remember that when you have certain visions and fantastic
experiences, they do not necessarily represent the awakening of
kundalini or even sushumna nadi. They may indicate chakra awakening or
they may just be the expression of your archetypes or samskaras. Because
of your sadhana, concentration or one-pointedness, you may be allowing
an outlet for your deep-rooted samskaras to express themselves.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[These experiences and those that accompany chakra awakening do not mean
anything when you try to assess them. I will give you an example. Many
years ago, I was meditating on the bank of the Ganga in Rishikesh and
suddenly I had a very vivid experience. I saw the whole earth split into
two. It was a very clear vision, and I remember it even today, but this
vision had nothing to do with reality; I just had it. This was an
experience of chakra awakening.]{.class-0}

[When the actual awakening of kundalini takes place, it is a great
event. Every experience has a tangible proof, whether it is awakening of
extrasensory perceptions or the awakening of a particular kind of
genius. It may be in the form of a philosophy you are able to deliver to
people, a transformation in the physical elements of the body that you
are able to materialize, or a magnetic influence that you can cast over
the masses of people as a politician, musician or saint.]{.class-0}

There is a natural process of transition in which a person's
consciousness evolves over the course of millions of years. It takes
place in the same way that a baby develops into a child, a child into a
young person, a young person into a middle-aged person, a middle-aged
person into an old person. Suppose a child of five suddenly transformed
into an old person and found he was tall, grey haired and speaking like
an old person. It would be very difficult for him to handle the
situation and to connect both the areas of his life. This is what
generally happens with those who awaken kundalini.

would start to think you were crazy! These are just a few of the bizarre
experiences you could be confronted with. However, with the awakening of

practices, for even without confronting, controlling or trying to
balance the mind, you can still evolve.

The tamasic mind has traces of rajo guna, and as it evolves, it retains
traces of tamas, but it is now predominantly rajasic. It also develops
traces of sattwa. As it evolves further, it becomes more rajasic and may
or may not have traces of tamas and sattwa. Next, it becomes
predominantly sattwic, with traces of rajo and tamo gunas here and
there. Then in its fifth stage of evolution, the mind becomes totally
sattwic, manifesting rajo and tamo gunas very rarely.

The practices
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
There are many kriya yoga practices, but a combination of twenty is
considered very important and powerful. These twenty practices are
divided into two groups. One group, comprised of the first nine
practices, is to be done with the eyes open, and the other group,
comprised of eleven practices, is to be done with the eyes closed. For
the first group of practices, the central instruction is, "Do not close
[]{#part0022.xhtml_page_98} your eyes." Even though you feel very
relaxed and have a tendency to go within, you must not close your eyes.
You can blink, you can rest, you can stop the practices for a minute,
but each practice must be done with the eyes open. This is a very
important instruction for kriya yoga practise.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The first practice in kriya yoga is called vipareeta karani mudra.
Vipareeta means reverse and karani means action, therefore, vipareeta
karani mudra is a method for creating a reverse action. In]{.class-0}
[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]{.class5827-1} [and in the tantric texts, there is
a wonderful statement regarding this reverse action: "From the moon the
nectar emanates. When the sun consumes the nectar, the yogi becomes old.
His body decays and he dies. Therefore, by constant practice, the yogi
should try to reverse the process. The nectar which is flowing from the
moon (bindu) towards the sun (manipura chakra) should be reversed and
sent back to the higher centres." What will happen then?]{.class-0}
[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]{.class5827-1} [continues: "When you are able to
reverse the flow of amrit or nectar, it will not be consumed by the sun.
It will be assimilated by your pure body."]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When your body has been purified by hatha yoga, pranayama and a pure
diet, this nectar is assimilated by the body and, as a result, you
experience a high mental state. When the nectar returns to its source in
the higher centres of the brain, and is not consumed by the sun, you
begin to feel a sort of calmness and quietness. Even if your mind was
distracted, confused, wandering and vacillating a few moments before,
suddenly all these activities come to an end and you feel total
brightness. Your eyes are open, you can hear sounds and see everything
around you, but the mind does not move. It appears as if time, space and
object have ceased and the whole universe has stopped
functioning.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The main hypothesis or contention here is that you can influence the
structures of the body; you can create a change in the energy forces. By
creating a change in the physical secretions, by altering the chemical
and energy proportions in the body, you can create an effect on the mind
which you]{.class-0} []{#part0022.xhtml_page_99 .class-0} [may call
shanti, dharana, dhyana or samadhi. This means that even when your mind
is totally undisciplined and you cannot handle it for a second, if you
are able to create the correct proportion of secretions in the different
areas of the body/mind, then the higher state can be
achieved.]{.class-0}

[You know what happens if you take a dose of ganja (marijuana)? Take a
few puffs and see what happens to your mind. It slows down and the brain
waves change from theta to beta, from alpha to delta. Suddenly you feel
calm and quiet. What happened to your mind? You did not fight with it. I
am not advocating the use of ganja, I am just giving you a very gross
example of how kriya yoga works on your mind. By infusing ganja or some
hallucinogenic drug, the chemical properties of the gross body change.
The heart slows down, the breathing rate changes, the brain waves alter
and the mind becomes calm and still. Is it not possible to arrive at the
same point through kriya yoga? Yes, this is exactly what is accomplished
through kriya yoga.]{.class-0}

[The various practices of kriya yoga, particularly vipareeta karani
mudra, amrit pan, khechari mudra, moola bandha, maha mudra, maha bheda
mudra, etc. regulate the nervous system. They harmonize the pranic
forces in the body and equalize the quantity and effects of the positive
and negative ions. More than that, they help you to attain a state of
peace and tranquillity without beating, kicking and abusing the mind.
All this is a result of having induced the flow of certain unused and
natural chemicals of the body. Amrit is one of those chemicals and
through a practice known as khechari mudra, it can be made to
flow.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Khechari mudra
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Khechari mudra is a simple but very important technique which is
utilized in most of the kriya yoga practices. It involves folding the
tongue back and placing it against the upper palate. In the course of
time the tongue becomes elongated and can be inserted into the nasal
orifice. Then certain glands which are connected with the cranial
passage []{#part0022.xhtml_page_100} and bindu are stimulated and, as a
result, amrit or nectar begins to flow. When amrit is released you
experience a special type of 'high' or intoxication.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[It might take you a few years to perfect khechari mudra and to
stimulate the flow of amrit, but it is well worth the effort. When you
sit for meditation the mind is perfectly still, it cannot move and you
cannot think. There is shoonyata, an experience of total nothingness. If
you are practising mantra, you feel that somebody else is practising and
you are only witnessing it. This is considered a very important
experience because it puts you in touch with the external and internal
experiences at the same time and you are completely aware of yourself.
You attain a state where you are simultaneously aware of the world of
mind, senses and objects, and the world of inner peace, tranquillity and
relaxation. When there is perfect harmony in the nervous system,
coronary behaviour is in inertia, body temperature is low and alpha
waves are predominant in the brain, how can the mind move? This is the
philosophy of kriya yoga.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Readiness for kriya yoga
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
If through the yoga practices you have been doing, you have reached a
point where you find that although concentration has been achieved,
inner peace has been experienced and you can maintain total quietness of
body, mind and spirit for a prolonged period, but still you feel there
is something more to achieve, you are definitely ready for kriya yoga.

[Peace of mind, relaxation and proper understanding, which are the
fruits of spiritual life, are not an end in themselves. The ultimate
purpose of yoga is to change the quality of experience and to change the
quality of the mind and its perception. What man has aimed at achieving
through yoga is expansion of mind and liberation of energy and, in
essence, that is tantra, and that is the ultimate goal of kriya

[S]{.class220-kfx-dropcap} exual life has always been a problem for
mankind. From the beginning of history, the primal energy has been
misunderstood. Religious teachers and moralists have denounced it, but
still sexual life has continued, not because man respects it, but
because he needs it. He may want to give it up, but he cannot remove it
from his mind, for this is one of his most powerful urges.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In the context of yoga and tantra the common definition of sexual life
has no relevance. It is absolutely unscientific and incorrect. This
definition has created a society of hypocrites. It has led thousands of
young people into mental asylums. When you want something which you
think is bad, all kinds of guilt complexes arise. This is the beginning
of schizophrenia, and all of us are schizophrenic to some
extent.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Therefore, the yogis have tried to give a correct direction to the
sexual urge. Yoga does not interfere with sexual life. Normal sexual
life is neither spiritual nor aspiritual, but if you practise yoga and
master certain techniques, then sexual life becomes spiritual. Of
course, if you lead a celibate life, that is spiritual too.]{.class-0}

Left hand tantra
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The science of tantra has two main branches, which are known as vama
marga and dakshina marga. Vama marga is the left path which combines
sexual life with yoga practices []{#part0023.xhtml_page_102} in order to
explode the dormant energy centres. Dakshina marga is the right path of
yoga practices without sexual enactment. Previously, due to the barriers
in sexual life, the path most widely followed was dakshina marga. Today,
however, these barriers are rapidly being broken, and the path most
sought after by people everywhere is vama marga, which utilizes sexual
life for spiritual development.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[According to tantra, sexual life has a threefold purpose. Some practise
it for procreation, others for pleasure, but the tantric yogi practises
it for samadhi. He does not hold any negative views about it, he does it
as a part of his sadhana, but, at the same time, he realizes that for
spiritual purposes, the experience must be maintained. Ordinarily this
experience is lost before one is able to deepen it. By mastering certain
techniques, however, this experience can become continuous even
throughout daily life. Then the silent centres of the brain are awakened
and start to function all the time.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
The energy principle
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The contention of vama marga is that the awakening of kundalini is
possible through the sexual interaction between man and woman. The
concept behind this follows the same lines as the process of fission and
fusion described in modern physics. Man and woman represent positive and
negative energy. On a mental level they represent time and space.
Ordinarily, these two forces stand at opposite poles. During sexual
interaction, however, they move out of their position of polarity,
towards the centre. When they come together at the nucleus or central
point, an explosion occurs and matter becomes manifest. This is the
basic theme of tantric initiation.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The natural event that takes place between a man and woman is
considered as the explosion of the energy centre. In every speck of
life, the union between the positive and negative poles is responsible
for creation. At the same time, union between the positive and negative
poles is also responsible for enlightenment. The experience which takes
place at the time of union is a glimpse of the higher
experience.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {#part0023.xhtml_page_103 .class179 lang="en-us"}
[This subject has been thoroughly discussed in all the old scriptures of
tantra. Actually, more important than the energy waves that are created
during the mutual union, is the process of directing that energy to the
higher centres. Everybody knows how this energy is to be created, but
nobody knows how to direct it to the higher centres. In fact, very few
people have a full and positive understanding of this natural event
which almost everybody in the world experiences. If the conjugal
experience, which is generally very transitory, could be extended for a
period of time, then the experience of enlightenment would take
place.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The elements that are brought together in this process of union are
known as Shiva and Shakti. Shiva represents purusha or consciousness and
Shakti represents prakriti or energy. Shakti, in different forms, is
present in all creation. Both material and spiritual energy are known as
Shakti. When the energy moves outwardly it is material energy and when
it is directed upwards it is spiritual energy. Therefore, when the union
between man and woman is practised in the correct way, it has a very
positive influence on the development of spiritual awareness.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Retaining the bindu
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Bindu means a point or a drop. In tantra, bindu is considered to be the
nucleus, or the abode of matter, the point from which all creation
becomes manifest. The source of bindu is actually in the higher centres
of the brain, but due to the development of emotions and passions, bindu
falls down to the lower region where it is transformed into sperm and
ova. At the higher level bindu is a point. At the lower level it is a
drop of liquid, which drips from the male and female orgasm.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[According to tantra, the preservation of the bindu is absolutely
necessary for two reasons. Firstly, the process of regeneration can only
be carried out with the help of bindu. Secondly, all the spiritual
experiences take place when there is an explosion of bindu. This
explosion can result in the creation of a thought or of anything.
Therefore, in tantra,]{.class-0} []{#part0023.xhtml_page_104 .class-0}
[certain practices are recommended by which the male partner can stop
ejaculation and retain the bindu.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[According to tantra, ejaculation should not take place. One should
learn how to stop it. For this purpose, the male partner should perfect
the practices of vajroli mudra as well as moola bandha and uddiyana
bandha. When these three kriyas are perfected, one is able to stop
ejaculation completely at any point of the experience.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The sexual act culminates in a particular experience which is reached
only at the point of explosion of energy. Unless the energy explodes,
the experience cannot take place. However, this experience has to be
maintained so that the energy level remains high. When the energy level
falls, ejaculation takes place. Therefore, ejaculation is avoided, not
so much to preserve the semen, but because it causes a depression in the
level of energy.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[To make this energy travel upwards through the spine, certain hatha
yoga kriyas have to be mastered. The experience which is concomitant of
energy has to be raised to the higher centres. It is only possible to do
this if you are able to prolong and maintain that experience. As long as
the experience continues, you can direct it to the higher centres, but
as soon as the energy level undergoes depression, ejaculation will
inevitably take place.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Ejaculation brings down the temperature of the body and, at the same
time, the nervous system undergoes depression. When the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems undergo depression, the brain is
affected, which is why many people have mental problems. When you are
able to retain the semen without ejaculating at all, the energy in the
nervous system and the temperature in the whole body are maintained. At
the same time, you are free from the sense of loss, depression,
frustration and guilt. Retention of the semen will also help to increase
the sexual frequency, and that is better for both partners. The sexual
act does not have to create weakness or dissipate the energy, on the
contrary, it can become a means of exploding the energy.]{.class-0}
[]{#part0023.xhtml_page_105 .class-0} [Therefore, the value of retaining
the bindu should not be underestimated.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In hatha yoga there are certain practices which must be perfected for
this purpose. You should begin with asanas such as paschimottanasana,
shalabhasana, vajrasana, supta vajrasana and siddhasana. These are
beneficial as they place an automatic contraction on the lower centres.
Sirshasana is also important because it ventilates the brain so that all
of one's experiences will be healthy. When these postures have been
mastered, shambhavi mudra is perfected in order to hold the
concentration steadily at bhrumadhya. Then vajroli mudra has to be
practised together with moola bandha and uddiyana bandha with kumbhaka.
Practise of kumbhaka is necessary while the ejaculation is being held.
Retention of the breath and the bindu go hand in hand. Loss of kumbhaka
is loss of bindu, and loss of bindu is loss of kumbhaka.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[During kumbhaka, when you are maintaining the experience, you should be
able to direct it to the higher centres. If you are able to create an
archetype of this experience, perhaps in the form of a serpent or a
luminous continuity, then the result will be fantastic. So, in spiritual
life bindu must be preserved at all costs.]{.class-0}

The female experience
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In the female body, the point of concentration is at mooladhara chakra,
which is situated at the cervix, just behind the opening of the uterus.
This is the point where space and time unite and explode in the form of
an experience. In ordinary language that experience is known as orgasm,
but in the language of tantra it is called an awakening. In order to
maintain the continuity of that experience, it is necessary for a build
up of energy to take place at that particular bindu or point. Usually
this does not happen because the explosion of energy dissipates
throughout the body through the sexual orgasm. In order to avoid this
happening, the woman must be able to hold her mind in absolute
concentration on that particular point. The practice for this is known
as sahajoli. []{#part0023.xhtml_page_106} Sahajoli is actually
concentration on the bindu, but this is very difficult. Therefore, the
practice of sahajoli, which is the contraction of the vaginal as well as
the uterine muscles, should be practised over a long period of time.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[If girls are taught uddiyana bandha at an early age, they will perfect
sahajoli quite naturally with time. Uddiyana bandha is always practised
with external retention. It is important to be able to perform this in
any position. Usually it is practised in siddha yoni asana, but one
should be able to do it in vajrasana or the crow posture as well. When
you practise uddiyana bandha, the other two bandhas -- jalandhara and
moola bandha, occur spontaneously.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Years of practice will create a keen sense of concentration on the
correct point in the body. This concentration is more mental in nature;
however, since it is not possible to do it mentally one has to start
from some physical point. If a woman is able to concentrate and maintain
the continuity of the experience, she can awaken her energy to a high
level.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[According to tantra, there are two different areas of orgasm. One is in
the nervous zone, which is the common experience for most women, and the
other is in mooladhara chakra. When sahajoli is practised during
maithuna (the act of sexual union), mooladhara chakra wakes up and the
spiritual or tantric orgasm takes place.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When the female yogi is able to practise sahajoli for say five to
fifteen minutes, she can retain the tantric orgasm for the same period
of time. By retaining this experience, the flow of energy is reversed.
Circulation of blood and sympathetic/parasympathetic forces move upward.
At this point, she transcends normal consciousness and sees the light.
That is how she enters the deep state of dhyana. Unless the woman is
able to practise sahajoli, she will not be able to retain the impulses
necessary for the tantric orgasm, and consequently she will have the
nervous orgasm, which is short-lived and followed by dissatisfaction and
exhaustion. This is often the cause of a woman's hysteria and
depression. So sahajoli is an extremely important practice for women.

Just as in the scheme of creation, Shakti is the creator and Shiva the

from the woman to the man. In the tantric practice, it is the woman who
initiates. It is only by her power that the act of maithuna takes place.
All the preliminaries are done by her. She puts the mark on the man's
forehead and tells him where to meditate. In ordinary interaction the
man takes the aggressive role and the woman participates, but in tantra
they switch roles. The woman becomes the operator and the man her
medium. She has to be able to arouse him. Then, at the right moment, she
must create the bindu so he can practise vajroli. If the man loses his
bindu, it means that the woman has failed to carry out her functions
properly.

instinctive urges are absent. According to tradition, this is why the
path of dakshina marga must be followed for many years before the path
of vama marga can be entered. Then the interaction of maithuna does not
take place for physical gratification. The purpose is very clear --

Chakra perception
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The chakras, kundalini and the mind have subtle aspects on all levels of
vibration. This is extremely complicated and most of the realization at
these levels must be very personal. Even then, different people see
these occult aspects from different points of view. For instance, if
they have realizations about the chakras, these will be coloured by
their own personal tendencies. Some concentrate on their more subtle
mystical aspects, some on their energy and pranic manifestations, some
on their functional reality, some on their psychological effects, and
still others on their physical concomitants. These are usually all
correct and when various authorities get together, they find that they
are talking about the same things but from different points of view. If
we look at a person through binoculars, he looks large. If we look at
him with ordinary vision, he looks the usual size. If we view him
through an X-ray screen, we see his skeleton, and if we look through a
gastroscope, we see the inside of his stomach. Same person -- different
viewpoints.

[In the same way, whereas a mystic or yogi will describe the chakras in
a spiritual or symbolic way, the surgeon may describe the chakras as
bunches of nerve fibres making up what he calls the plexuses, and a
clairvoyant will describe the energy manifestations of the chakras in
yet a different way. These people may have disagreements, but actually
they are seeing the same thing from different viewpoints. Discrepancies
are largely semantic due to differing cultural, educational and personal
understandings. This is a common problem amongst people when they try to
communicate any idea or experience in words.]{.class-0}

[Whereas I have great respect for the tantric concept, I have my own

Chakra symbology

If you are practising kundalini or kriya yoga, you will need to know the

experiences.

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Whereas the various esoteric cults and spiritual systems use different
symbols to represent the chakras, in tantra and yoga the chakras are
symbolized by lotus flowers. As a symbol, the lotus is very significant.
Man must pass through three clear stages in spiritual life, which
represent his existence on three different levels: ignorance, aspiration
and endeavour, and illumination. The lotus also exists on three
different levels -- mud, water and air. It sprouts in the mud
(ignorance), grows up through the water in an effort to reach the
surface (endeavour and aspiration) and eventually]{.class-0}

light of the sun (illumination). Thus the lotus symbolizes man's growth
from the lowest states of awareness to the higher states of
consciousness. The culmination of the growth of the lotus is a beautiful
flower. In the same way, the culmination of man's spiritual quest is the
awakening and blossoming of human potential.]{.class-0}

Chakra kshetram
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In many of the practices of kundalini yoga we must concentrate or focus
our awareness on the chakra trigger points in the spinal cord. However,
many people find it easier []{#part0025.xhtml_page_117} to concentrate
on the chakra kshetram located on the front surface of the body. In
kriya yoga particularly, the chakra kshetrams are utilized in many of
the practices. The kshetrams can be regarded as reflections of the
original chakra trigger points, and when we concentrate on them it
creates a sensation which passes through the nerves to the chakra itself
and then travels up to the brain.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Mooladhara does not have a kshetram, but swadhisthana, manipura,
anahata, vishuddhi and ajna have physical counterparts directly in front
of them on the same horizontal plane. Swadhisthana kshetram is at the
level of the pubic bone in the front of the body, just above the genital
organ. Manipura kshetram is at the navel, anahata kshetram is at the
heart, and vishuddhi kshetram is located on the front surface of the
throat pit, in the vicinity of the thyroid gland. Ajna kshetram is
bhrumadhya, the mid-eyebrow centre.]{.class-0}

The granthis
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
There are three [granthis]{.class5827-0} (psychic knots) in the physical
body which are obstacles on the path of the awakened kundalini. The
granthis are called [brahma]{.class5827-0} , [vishnu]{.class5827-0} and
[rudra]{.class5827-0} , and they represent levels of awareness where the
power of [maya]{.class5827-0} , ignorance and attachment to material
things is especially strong. Each aspirant must transcend these barriers
to make a clear passageway for the ascending kundalini.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Brahma granthi functions in the region of mooladhara chakra. It implies
attachment to physical pleasures, material objects and excessive
selfishness. It also implies the ensnaring power of tamas -- negativity,
lethargy and ignorance.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}

Conversion centres
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Besides functioning as control centres, the chakras work as centres of
interchange between the physical, astral and causal dimensions. For
instance, through the chakras, subtle energy from the astral and causal
dimension can be transformed into energy for the physical dimension.
This can be seen in yogis who have been buried underground for long
periods of time. Through activation of vishuddhi chakra, which controls
hunger and thirst and enables one to subsist on subtle energy in the
form of amrit or nectar, they have been able to maintain their
existence.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[It is further contemplated that physical energy can be transformed into
subtle energy through the action of the chakras and that physical energy
can be converted into mental energy within the physical
dimension.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class202 lang="en-us"}
[Thus the chakras are seen to be intermediaries for energy transfer and
conversion between two neighbouring dimensions of being as well as
facilitating the energy conversion between the body and mind. As the
chakras are activated and awakened, man not only becomes aware of the
higher realms of existence, but also gains the power to enter those
realms and then, in turn, to support and give life to the lower
dimensions.]{.class-0}

[A]{.class220-kfx-dropcap} ll life is evolving and man is no exception.
Human evolution, the evolution which we are undergoing relentlessly,
both as individuals and as a race, is a journey through the different
chakras. Mooladhara is the most basic, fundamental chakra from where we
commence our evolution, and sahasrara is where our evolution is
completed. As we evolve towards sahasrara, outer experiences come our
way in life, and inner experiences come to us in meditation, as
different capacities and centres awaken progressively within the nervous
system. This occurs as energy flows at higher voltages and rates of
vibration through the different nadis in the psychic body.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Mooladhara is the first centre in human incarnation, but it is the
highest chakra that animals have the capacity to awaken. It is their
sahasrara. The higher chakras beyond mooladhara are not present in the
psychic physiology of animals and their nervous systems reflect this
relative deficiency.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Below mooladhara there are other chakras, known as patalas, which
represent the evolution of the animal kingdom. These chakras are only
related to sense consciousness and not to mental awareness. When your
consciousness was evolving through these chakras your mind was only
associated with sense consciousness. There was no individual awareness
and no ego; it began from mooladhara. These]{.class-0}
[]{#part0026.xhtml_page_120 .class-0} [lower centres are no longer
functioning in human beings because we have transcended them.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In the animal body, these inferior chakras are situated in the legs,
and so are the nadis. The nadis flow to their confluence point at
mooladhara chakra, just as the nadis in the human body flow to ajna
chakra. The names of the lower chakras are]{.class-0} [atala, vitala,
sutala, talatala, rasatala, mahatala]{.class5827-1} [and the lowest
is]{.class-0} [patala]{.class5827-1} [. Just as mooladhara is the lowest
chakra in the human body, patala is the lowest in the animal kingdom. It
is the dimension which represents total darkness, where nature is not
functioning and matter is completely dormant and static.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Above sahasrara there are also other chakras, or we can call
them]{.class-0} [lokas]{.class5827-1} [, which represent the higher
divine consciousness. So mooladhara chakra is the highest in animal
evolution and the first in human evolution. Sahasrara is the highest
point in human evolution and the first step in the highest divine
evolution.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[As you read more about the chakras, you will come to realize that
kundalini actually controls every affair of life. When this shakti was
passing through the animal stages of our evolution, it was influencing
the whole species with]{.class-0} [avidya]{.class5827-1} [or ignorance.
On account of its influence, the animal kingdom was compelled to follow
the instinctual path of eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. This
represented the tamasic phase of evolution. From mooladhara onward we
pass through the rajasic phase and from sahasrara onward we enter the
sattwic phase of evolution.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Spontaneous and self-propelled evolution
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Up to mooladhara chakra evolution takes place automatically. Animals do
not have to practise pranayama and japa yoga. They do not have to find a
guru, take sannyasa and become disciples. They do not have to do
anything and they can eat whatever they want. Nature controls them
completely. Because they do not think, nature is benevolently
responsible for every phase of their evolution.
:::

::: {#part0026.xhtml_page_121 .class179 lang="en-us"}
[However, once kundalini reaches mooladhara chakra, evolution is no
longer spontaneous because a human being is not completely subject to
the laws of nature. For example, animals will only mate in particular
seasons. At other times, even if they live together, they will not mate.
But, because man is free from the laws of nature, he can mate whenever
he chooses.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Man has awareness of time and space, and he has an ego. He can think,
he can know that he is thinking and he can know that he knows that he is
thinking. This is due to the evolution of ego. If there is no ego, there
will be no double awareness. Animals do not have double awareness. If a
dog is chasing another dog, it is under nature's compulsion. It does not
know that it is running. It runs because instinct compels it
to.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[So, man has a higher consciousness, and once he has it he has to work
towards its evolution. That is why it is said that kundalini is sleeping
in mooladhara chakra. It cannot progress beyond this point unless it is
pushed.]{.class-0}

Discovering your point of evolution
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Of course, when the shakti awakens suddenly in mooladhara, it cannot
rise immediately. It may wake up and sleep again many times. In the
morning you usually have to wake your children several times because
they keep going back to sleep. Kundalini behaves in the same way.
Sometimes it even ascends to swadhisthana or manipura, only to return to
mooladhara again to sleep. However, once the shakti goes beyond manipura
chakra there is no going back. Stagnation in a chakra only occurs when
there is an obstruction in sushumna or one of the chakras. Kundalini can
remain in one chakra for many years, or even for a whole lifetime.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Sometimes, when kundalini gets blocked in a chakra during transit, you
begin to exhibit some of the siddhis or psychic powers associated with
that chakra. At that time you may not have self-control and
understanding of the fact that you are only on the road. When one
attains siddhis one is]{.class-0} []{#part0026.xhtml_page_122 .class-0}

of humanity, but this only feeds the ego and clouds one in a thick veil
of maya or ignorance, hindering further progress.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[If one is manifesting siddhis, one can assume that one has evolved to
the chakra which is associated with those siddhis. However, siddhis do
not usually manifest when kundalini passes through all the chakras
quickly and, if they do, they will not stay long. For a few days you may
be able to read the thoughts of others, but then that ability will pass
away. For a few days you may be able to heal people, but that will also
pass. Psychic powers usually only linger when kundalini gets blocked in
a chakra.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Of course, some of our lower chakras may already be functioning without
our knowledge. We are all at different levels on the scale of evolution
and, therefore, it may not be necessary to start the process of
awakening from mooladhara. We say that kundalini is in mooladhara in
order to explain the whole concept, but due to your progress in previous
lives, or the sadhana your mother or father may have done, you might
have been born with your kundalini in manipura. If that is the case, the
ascension must take place from that point. However, as you cannot
remember your previous life, similarly you have also forgotten about the
state of your kundalini. That is why the gurus teach that kundalini is
sleeping in mooladhara. It may be in anahata, but I will always tell you
it is in mooladhara and make you do the practices from mooladhara. You
might not have any experience of kundalini there. You may go to
swadhisthana and manipura and not have any experiences there either. But
the moment you go to anahata you suddenly start having
experiences.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[So before you commence the practices of kundalini yoga, you should try
to find out at which point your ascension will actually start. In order
to do this, the best method is to concentrate on mooladhara daily for
fifteen to thirty minutes, then swadhisthana for fifteen days, manipura
for fifteen days]{.class-0} []{#part0026.xhtml_page_123 .class-0} [and
so on up to sahasrara. You will soon discover your point of
evolution.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Some people will find concentration on anahata easiest, so that is
likely to be their centre. Others will find ajna chakra very powerful
and attractive to them, whereas other people will find it easiest to
relate to mooladhara, while the higher chakras seem almost impossible to
locate. Ultimately you will be able to decide which is your most
sensitive chakra, and you will be ready for the next step, which is
awakening.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[However, there is one important point to be added. Even if a higher
chakra such as anahata has awakened at random, you must try to awaken
the lower chakras also. The purpose of awakening kundalini and ascending
it through all the chakras is to awaken them and their related parts of
the brain. Therefore, in order to awaken the whole brain, all the
chakras must be awakened.]{.class-0}

it is on account of ego that we are aware of dualities. As long as there
is duality, there cannot be samadhi; as long as you remember yourself,
you cannot get out of yourself.]{.class-0}

[Although there are experiences of trance in the other chakras, there is
no merger of the individual ego with the cosmic ego. All throughout you

are having, but when ida and pingala unite with sushumna in ajna chakra,
you lose yourself completely.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[By this I do not mean that you become unconscious. Your awareness
expands and becomes homogeneous. The individual awareness falls flat and
you completely transcend the realm of duality. Therefore, ajna chakra is
a very important centre, which you must experience in order to bring
about purification of the mind. Once the mind is purified, the
experience and awakening of the other chakras can proceed.]{.class-0}

[There is a certain problem with the awakening of the other chakras.
Each of these chakras contains within it a store of karmas or samskaras,
which may be both good and bad, positive and negative, painful and
pleasant. The awakening of any chakra will bring to the surface an
explosion or an expression of these karmas, and not everybody is
prepared or ready to face them. Only those who are equipped with reason
and understanding can cope. Therefore, it is said that, before you start
awakening and manifesting the great force, it is best to purify the mind
at the point of confluence. Then, with a purified mind, you can awaken
all the other chakras. Therefore, we begin our exposition of the chakras
with ajna.]{.class-0}

The centre of command
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The word [ajna]{.class5827-0} comes from the Sanskrit root which means
'to know, to obey or to follow'. Literally, ajna means 'command' or 'the
monitoring centre'. In astrology ajna is the centre of Jupiter, which
symbolizes the guru or preceptor. Amongst the deities, Jupiter is
represented by Brihaspati, the guru of the devas and preceptor of the
gods. Therefore, this centre is also known as 'the guru chakra'.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Ajna is the bridge which links the guru with the disciples. It
represents the level at which it is possible for direct mind to mind
communication to take place between two people. It is in this chakra
that communication with the external guru, teacher or preceptor takes
place. And it is here that the directions of the inner guru are heard in
the deepest state of meditation, when all the sense modalities are
withdrawn and one enters the state of]{.class-0} [shoonya]{.class5827-1}

it the voice or command of the guru must be heard in ajna

The location point
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Ajna chakra is located in the brain, directly behind the eyebrow centre.
It is at the very top of the spinal cord, at the medulla oblongata.
Initially it is very hard to feel the exact location point of ajna, so
we concentrate on ajna kshetram, at the mid-eyebrow centre, bhrumadhya.
These two centres are directly connected. That is why it has always been
an Indian custom to place tilaka, chandan, sindoor or kumkum on the
mid-eyebrow centre. Sindoor contains mercury, and when it is applied to
the eyebrow centre, a constant pressure is exerted on the nerve which
runs from bhrumadhya to the medulla oblongata. Maybe the original
purpose for applying these substances has been forgotten by most people
today, but it is not a religious mark or even a beauty spot. It is a
means by which you can maintain constant conscious and unconscious
awareness of ajna chakra.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[It should also be mentioned here that the pineal gland is the physical
concomitant of ajna chakra and the pituitary gland of sahasrara. Just as
the pituitary and pineal glands are]{.class-0}
[]{#part0027.xhtml_page_131 .class-0} [intimately connected, so are ajna

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The pineal gland acts as a lock on the pituitary. As long as the pineal
gland is healthy, the functions of the pituitary are controlled.
However, in most of us, the pineal gland started to degenerate when we
reached the age of eight, nine or ten. Then the pituitary began to
function and to secrete various hormones which instigated our sexual
consciousness, our sensuality and worldly personality. At this time we
began to lose touch with our spiritual heritage. However, through
various yogic techniques, such as trataka and shambhavi mudra, it is
possible to regenerate or maintain the health of the pineal
gland.]{.class-0}

Traditional symbology
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Ajna is symbolized by a two-petalled lotus. According to the scriptures,
it is a pale colour, light grey like a rainy day. Some say it is white
like the moon, or silver, but actually it is an intangible colour. On
the left petal is the letter [ham]{.class5827-0}
![](image895.jpg){.class896} and on the right [ksham]{.class5827-0}
![](image899.jpg){.class900} . Ham and ksham are inscribed in a silvery
white colour and are the beeja mantras for Shiva and Shakti. One
represents the moon or ida nadi and the other the sun or pingala nadi.
Below the chakra the three nadis merge -- ida on the left, pingala on
the right and sushumna in between.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Within the lotus is a perfectly round circle which symbolizes shoonya,
the void. Within the circle is an inverted triangle which represents
shakti -- creativity and manifestation. Above the triangle is a black
shivalingam. The shivalingam is not, as many people believe, a phallic
symbol. It is the symbol of your astral body. According to tantra and
occult sciences, the astral body is the attribute of your personality,
and in the form of the shivalingam, it can be one of three colours,

consciousness.]{.class-0}

knowledge directly via a sixth or intuitive sense, which comes into
operation as ajna chakra awakens. This sense is the jnanendriya of the
mind. Similarly, the mind can manifest actively without the aid

similar to that induced by ganja (marijuana) or any other drug of that

and moon. He is able to enter another's body at will and becomes the
most excellent amongst munis, being all-knowing and all-seeing. He
becomes the benefactor of all and is versed in all the shastras. He
realizes his unity with the Brahman and acquires siddhis. Different

Ajna and the mind
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
So, ajna is essentially the chakra of the mind, representing a higher
level of awareness. Whenever you concentrate on something, whether it is
mooladhara, swadhisthana or manipura chakra, or you concentrate on an
external object or an idea, ajna is affected, sometimes mildly,
sometimes powerfully, depending on the degree of your concentration.
When we visualize or when we dream at night, the inner vision that
occurs is through ajna. If you are eating, sleeping or talking and you
are not aware of it, then ajna is not operating, but if you are talking
and one area of your awareness knows it, this knowing, this awareness is
the faculty of ajna.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When you develop ajna, you can have knowledge without the aid of the
senses. Normally all knowledge comes to us by means of information the
senses conduct to the brain, and a process of classification, logic, and
intellect that takes place]{.class-0} []{#part0027.xhtml_page_134
.class-0} [in the frontal brain. However, the smaller brain, where ajna
chakra is situated, has the capacity to acquire knowledge directly
without the aid of the indriyas or senses. If it is a very cloudy day,
you can know, through logic that it will rain. But if there are no
clouds in the sky and still you know beyond a doubt that it will rain,
this means your intuition and perception are very acute, and ajna chakra
is functioning.]{.class-0}

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When ajna is awakened, fickleness of the individual mind disperses and

[Ajna is the witnessing centre where one becomes the detached observer
of all events, including those within the body and mind. Here the level

underlying all visible appearances. When ajna is awakened, the meaning
and significance of symbols flashes into one's conscious perception and
intuitive knowledge arises effortlessly and one becomes a
'seer'.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[This is the centre of extrasensory perception where various siddhis
manifest according to one's samskaras or mental tendencies. For this
reason, ajna chakra is said to resemble a knot directly on top of the

Understanding cause and effect
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Until ajna chakra awakens we are under delusions, we view things
incorrectly and we have many great misconceptions about love and
attachment, hatred and jealousy, tragedy []{#part0027.xhtml_page_135}
and comedy, victory and defeat, and many other things. Our fears are
unfounded, so are our jealousies and attachments, but still we have
them. Our mind is functioning within a limited sphere and we cannot
transcend it. Just as we dream at night and our dream experiences are
relative, we are also dreaming in our waking state and our experiences
are relative. In the same way that we wake from a dream, when ajna
awakens, there is also a process of waking up from this present dream we
are living, and we can fully understand the relationship between cause
and effect.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[It is necessary for us to understand the law of cause and effect in
relation to our lives, otherwise we are depressed and sorrowful about
certain events in life. Supposing you give birth to a child and it dies

straight after birth, why was it born at all? You can only understand
the reason if you understand the laws of cause and effect.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Cause and effect are not immediate events. Each and every action is
both a cause and an effect. This life we have is an effect, but what was
the cause? You have to discover it, then you can understand the
relationship between cause and effect. It is only after awakening of
ajna chakra that these laws can be known. Thereafter your whole
philosophical attitude and approach to life changes. No events of life
affect you adversely, and the various objects and experiences that come
into your life and fade out of your life do not disturb you at all. You
participate in all the affairs of life and you live fully, but as a
detached witness. Life flows like a fast current and you surrender and
move with it.]{.class-0}
:::

Moving on from ajna to sahasrara
:::

::: {.class923 lang="en-us"}
To reach ajna chakra requires sadhana, discipline, firm belief and
persistent effort. With our present state of mind it is not possible to
know how to reach sahasrara, but once ajna chakra becomes active, you
develop superior perception and you realize how sahasrara can be
reached. It is like setting out on a journey from Munger to Marine
Drive, Bombay. []{#part0027.xhtml_page_136} The most important stage of
the journey is the long train trip to Bombay. Once you are there,
reaching Marine Drive is no problem. It is easy to find the way, you
just take a taxi and go there. So, in my opinion, it is not important
for us to know how to reach sahasrara from ajna chakra, but it is
essential for us to know how to awaken ajna.

Balancing the nadis
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Mooladhara is the base from which the three main psychic channels or
nadis emerge and flow up the spinal cord. It is said that ida, the
mental force, emerges from the left of mooladhara; pingala, the vital
force, from the right; and sushumna, the spiritual force, from the
centre. According to tantra, this emanation point is highly volatile.
When the positive and negative forces of ida and pingala are completely
[]{#part0028.xhtml_page_141} balanced, an awakening is sparked off here
which arouses the dormant kundalini. Usually, this state of balance
between ida and pingala nadis can only be achieved sporadically and for
short durations. This may be sufficient to trigger off a mild awakening,
in which kundalini rises as far as swadhisthana or manipura and then
drops back to mooladhara again.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Therefore, the hatha yoga practices, particularly those of pranayama,
are very important in kundalini yoga, because they purify and rebalance
the psychic flows. Once the state of balance between ida and pingala
becomes steady and ongoing, the awakening engendered in mooladhara
becomes explosive, and kundalini rises with great force, overcoming all
obstacles on its path until it reaches its ultimate destination in
sahasrara.]{.class-0}

pranic force called pranotthana. This preliminary awakening starts from
mooladhara and ascends the spinal cord via pingala nadi, only partially
purifying the chakras, until it reaches the brain where it is usually
dispersed.

awakening which is permanently accessible. Even though it may fall back

Mooladhara and sexual expression

the seat of kundalini and, secondly, because it is the seat of great
tamas. All of the passions are stored in []{#part0028.xhtml_page_142}
mooladhara, all the guilt, every complex and every agony has its root
here.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[This chakra is physiologically related to the excretory, urinary,
sexual and reproductive organs. It is very important for everybody to
awaken this chakra and get out of it. Our life, desires, actions and
accomplishments are controlled by the sexual desires, and whatever we do
in life is an expression of that lower chakra. Our lower samskaras and
karmas are embedded there and, as in lower incarnations, our whole being
is founded on the sexual personality. Dr Sigmund Freud has also
emphasized this point. He said that our selection of clothing, food,
friends, home furnishings, decor, etc., are influenced by our sexual
awareness.]{.class-0}

[Sexual fulfilment and sexual frustrations control our life. If sexual
urges are removed from life, everything will change. Often we react to
sexual life on account of bitter experiences and we vow not to follow
the same path again. We are fed up and on account of that we say, "No
more." But this is no solution, it is only a reaction and not the
permanent structure of our mind.]{.class-0}

[Unless mooladhara chakra is purified, its corresponding centre in the
brain will always remain tamasic. We can live the same type of life as
we do today, but we can make it much better. Sexual relationships are
not a sin, but the consciousness must awaken and the purpose of the
whole act must be transmuted. It is clearly stated in tantra that the
purpose of the sexual act is threefold, and these threefold purposes
depend on the level and frequency of one's mind. Some people practise it
for procreation, others for pleasure only, because that is the level of
their mind. Some practise it to open the window to samadhi. They do not
care for procreation or the fulfilment of passion; they are only
concerned with awakening an experience and sublimating it.]{.class-0}

practise the normal sexual act must awaken mooladhara chakra first.

chakras to awaken in a man's body, he will have to practise kriya yoga

don't you also give up eating and sleeping? Yoga has nothing to do with

Managing mooladhara awakening
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
When awakening takes place in mooladhara as the result of yoga practice
or other spiritual disciplines, many things explode into conscious
awareness in the same way that an erupting volcano pushes to the surface
things that were hidden beneath the earth. With the awakening of
kundalini, there is simultaneous awakening of things from the
unconscious field of human existence which one may not have had prior
conscious knowledge of whatsoever.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When mooladhara awakens, a number of phenomena occur. The first thing
many practitioners experience is levitation of the astral body. One has
the sensation of floating upward in space, leaving the physical body
behind. This is due to the energy of kundalini whose ascending momentum
causes the astral body to disassociate from the physical and move
upward. This phenomenon is limited to the astral and]{.class-0}
[]{#part0028.xhtml_page_144 .class-0} [possibly mental dimensions, and
this differs from what is normally called levitation -- the actual
displacement of the physical body.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Besides astral levitation, one sometimes experiences psychic phenomena
such as clairvoyance or clairaudience. Other common manifestations
include movements or increasing warmth in the area of the coccyx, or a
creeping sensation, like something moving slowly up the spinal cord.
These sensations result from the ascension of shakti or the awakened
kundalini.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In most cases, when the shakti reaches manipura chakra, it begins to
descend to mooladhara again. Sometimes the practitioner feels that the
energy ascends to the top of the head, but usually only a very small
portion of the shakti is able to pass beyond manipura. Repeated earnest
attempts are necessary for the further ascension of kundalini, but once
kundalini passes manipura chakra, serious obstacles are rarely
encountered.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[However, when kundalini is ascending from mooladhara to swadhisthana,
the sadhaka experiences a crucial period in which all his repressed
emotions, especially those of a more primal nature, express themselves.
Passions mount during this period and all kinds of infatuations ensue,
making the sadhaka extremely irritable and unstable at times. He can be
seen sitting quietly in contemplation one moment and hurling objects at
someone the next. One day he may sleep deeply for hours together,
another day he may get up at one or two in the morning to take a bath
and meditate. He becomes very passionate, loud and talkative, while at
other times he is silent. At this stage the sadhaka often expresses a
great fondness for singing.]{.class-0}

faculties of ajna chakra give the practitioner an ability to witness the
events of mooladhara awakening objectively, with greater understanding.

traumatic.]{.class-0}

indolence, depression and all kinds of tamasic characteristics. The
tendency to procrastinate is very strong and you just want to sleep and

outcome of a thorough analysis of the situations of life. Where is the
end to the pleasures of life? Can you ever satisfy your desires? Even

Transforming the primal energy

When no sexual desires of any kind manifest in an aspirant any more, and

passed beyond swadhisthana chakra. However, when you are dealing with
the subject of sex, your understanding must be very thorough. Although
you may not have any sexual awareness at the moment, that does not mean
your desires have been exterminated. They might be in a suppressed
state. There is an automatic process of suppression in the human
constitution, and that is inherent in our own mental being.

[Indian rishis have stated that sexual awareness and desires can
manifest at any stage of evolution. They are very acute and clearly
expressed when one is in swadhisthana and having continual fantasies,
but sexual awareness never really dies because it is fuelled by the
primal energy which is present all throughout. Sex is only an expression
of that, and therefore it can manifest at any stage, and one should
never think that one has transcended it. It is even present when one is
in the highest state of consciousness. The only difference is that in
swadhisthana it is in a very disturbed state, whereas in the higher
centres of evolution it is in a seed form. After all, what is bhakti or
devotion; what is union? They are the sublimated pure form of sexual
energy.]{.class-0}

talk about sex, you must understand that it is only a particular
formation of energy. Just as curd, butter and cheese are different
formations of the one thing -- milk, energy has different
manifestations. Matter is the grossest manifestation of energy; in the
ultimate state, matter is energy. Therefore, energy and matter are
intra-convertible. A thought is an object and an object is a thought.

[Manipura]{.class5827-0} is derived from two Sanskrit words:
[mani]{.class5827-0} meaning 'jewel' and [pura]{.class5827-0} meaning
'city'. Therefore, manipura literally means 'city of jewels'. In the
Tibetan tradition, this chakra is known as [mani padma]{.class5827-0} ,
which means 'jewelled lotus'.

[Manipura is a very important centre as far as the awakening of
kundalini shakti is concerned. It is the centre of dynamism, energy,
willpower and achievement and it is often compared to the dazzling heat
and power of the sun, without which life on earth would not exist. In
the same way that the sun continually radiates energy to the planets,
manipura chakra radiates and distributes pranic energy throughout the
entire human framework, regulating and energizing the various activities
of organs, systems and processes of life.]{.class-0}

the glowing embers of a dying fire rather than a powerful intense blaze.
In this state the individual is rendered lifeless, vitality deficient
and devoid of energy. He will be hindered by poor health, depression and
lack of motivation and commitment in life. Therefore, the awakening of
manipura is an important precedent, not only for the sadhaka, but for
anyone who wishes to enjoy life more fully.]{.class-0}

The location point

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Manipura chakra is located directly behind the navel on the inner wall
of the spinal column. The kshetram is situated right at the navel. This
chakra is anatomically related to the solar plexus, which controls the
digestive fire and heat regulation in the body.

Manipura is symbolized by a ten petalled bright yellow lotus. Some of
the tantric texts say the lotus petals are the colour of heavily laden
rain clouds. On each petal one of the ten letters: [pham]{.class5827-0}

![](image1119.jpg){.class955} , is inscribed in the colour of the blue
lotus. In the centre of the lotus is the region of fire, symbolized by
an inverted fiery red triangle which shines like the rising sun. The
triangle has a bhupura or swastika in the shape of a T on each of its
three sides. In the lower apex is the ram, vehicle for manipura,
symbolizing dynamism and indomitable endurance. Seated on the ram is the
beeja mantra of manipura -- [ram]{.class5827-0}
![](image1122.jpg){.class1123} . In the bindu reside the deva Rudra and
the devi Lakini. Rudra is of a pure vermilion hue and he is smeared with
white ashes. He is three-eyed and of an ancient aspect. Lakini, the
benefactress of all, is four-armed, of dark complexion and radiant body.
She is clothed in yellow raiment, decked with various ornaments and
exalted from drinking nectar.

adopting certain yogic practices which send the pranic forces in

The centre of awakening
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
According to the Buddhist tradition and many of the tantric texts, the
actual awakening of kundalini takes place from manipura and not from
mooladhara. In some tantric traditions, mooladhara and swadhisthana are
not referred to at all, as these two centres are believed to belong to
the higher realms of animal life, whereas from manipura onwards, higher
man predominates. So mooladhara is the seat of kundalini, swadhisthana
is the abode, and the awakening takes place in manipura. This is because
from manipura the awakening becomes ongoing and there is practically no
[]{#part0030.xhtml_page_159} danger of a downfall or devolution of
consciousness. Up to this point, kundalini may awaken and arise many
times, only to recede again, but awakening of manipura is what we call a
confirmed awakening.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[To stabilize the awareness in manipura and sustain the awakening there
is not easy. The sadhaka must be very earnest and persevering in his
effort to bring about further awakenings. I have found that in sincere
sadhakas, kundalini is mostly in manipura. If you are exposed to
spiritual life, practise yoga, have a keen desire to find a guru and to
pursue a higher life, side by side with the work you are doing, it means
kundalini is not in mooladhara. It is in manipura or one of the higher
centres.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Union of prana and apana
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In tantra there is an important branch known as [swara
yoga]{.class5827-0} , the science of the breath, which is used to bring
about the awakening of kundalini. According to this system, all the
pranas in the body are classified into five dimensions, [prana, apana,
vyana, udana]{.class5827-0} and [samana]{.class5827-0} . At the navel
region, there is an important junction where two of these vital forces,
prana and apana, meet.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The prana moves upwards and downwards between the navel and throat, and
the apana flows up and down between the perineum and navel. These two
movements are normally coupled together, like two railway carriages, so
that with the inspired breath, prana is experienced moving up from the
navel to the throat, while apana is simultaneously moving up to the
navel centre from mooladhara. Then with exhalation, prana descends from
the throat to the navel and apana descends from manipura to mooladhara.
In this way prana and apana are continually functioning together and
changing direction with the flow of the inspired/expired
breath.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[This movement can be readily experienced through relaxed breath
awareness in the psychic passages between the perineal region, the navel
and the throat centres in the front of the body. By gaining control
through particular kriyas,]{.class-0} []{#part0030.xhtml_page_160
.class-0} [the apana is separated from prana, and its flow is reversed
to bring about the awakening of the chakra. Whereas the apana normally
descends from manipura during expiration, the flow is reversed so that
prana and apana both enter the navel centre simultaneously from above
and below, and are joined. This is the union of prana and
apana.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[It is said that when kundalini wakes up in mooladhara it begins to
ascend spirally, like a hissing snake. However, the awakening of
kundalini in manipura takes place like a blast, as the prana and the
redirected apana meet in the navel centre. It is like two great forces
colliding with each other and then fusing together at this pranic
junction, manipura kshetram. As they fuse together, they create heat and
an energy or force which is conducted directly back from the navel to
the manipura chakra within the spinal cord. It is this force which
awakens manipura chakra. The force of sadhana has caused a total
reorganization of the pranic flow in the body, so that mooladhara is
transcended and the new base of kundalini is manipura chakra.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Manipura in perspective
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Human evolution takes place through seven planes in the same way that
kundalini awakens in the seven chakras. When the consciousness evolves
to manipura, the sadhaka acquires a spiritual perspective. He gets a
glimpse of the higher lokas or planes of existence.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[From mooladhara and swadhisthana, the higher planes cannot be seen.
Therefore, the limitations of perception in the lower planes are
responsible for the misuse of siddhis or powers which begin to manifest
there. Only when the sadhaka reaches manipura is he able to visualize
the infinite state of consciousness which is no longer gross and
empirical. It stretches before him endlessly, full of beauty, truth and
auspiciousness. In the face of this vision, all his views are completely
changed. The personal prejudices, complexes and biases drop away as the
endless beauty and perfection of the higher worlds dawn within the
consciousness.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {#part0030.xhtml_page_161 .class179 lang="en-us"}
[As long as the evolution is in the planes of mooladhara and
swadhisthana, one has mental and emotional problems and sees the whole
world correspondingly, but as soon as one transcends these planes and
goes to manipura, all the bliss, noble views, perfect ideas and greater
possibilities of human consciousness are seen. Then, naturally, whatever
one thinks and does will be influenced by this higher vision.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[This is why the psychic powers that come to the sadhaka after having
awakened and established the kundalini in manipura are really benevolent
and compassionate, whereas those which manifest in mooladhara and
swadhisthana are still tinged by the dark aspect of the lower
mind.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class202 lang="en-us"}
[The powers gained through the awakening of manipura chakra are the
ability to create and destroy, self-defence, the acquisition of hidden
treasures, no fear of fire, knowledge of one's own body, freedom from
disease and the ability to withdraw the energy to sahasrara.]{.class-0}

In kundalini yoga, anahata chakra is a centre of great importance. This
is because although awakening from manipura is constant, kundalini has
to remain in anahata for quite a long time. It is said that in this
present age, the consciousness of mankind is passing through a phase of
anahata. This means that in many people anahata chakra has started to
function. However, there is a difference between functioning and
awakening. In most people, anahata is not completely active, but it
functions slightly. Mooladhara, []{#part0031.xhtml_page_163} on the
other hand, is very active and almost awake in the majority of people
today.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The word]{.class-0} [anahata]{.class5827-1} [actually means 'unstruck'
or 'unbeaten'. This centre is known as such because of its relationship
with the heart, which throbs, beats or vibrates to a constant unbroken
rhythm. It is said in many of the scriptures that there is a sound which
is non-physical and non-empirical, which is transcendental in nature,
and this sound is endless and unbroken in the same way that the heart
beats faithfully and continuously from before birth up until
death.]{.class-0}

Tantric scriptures say that in anahata thoughts and desires of the
individual are materialized and fulfilled. There are basically two ways
of thinking: dependently or independently. Up to manipura chakra the
first approach holds true, but once the shakti pierces anahata, the
second approach takes precedence.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[As long as the consciousness is centred in the lower chakras, you will
remain completely dependent on what is already enjoined for you, your
fate or destiny,]{.class-0} [prarabdha karma]{.class5827-1} [. Even the
awakening of the lower chakras does not make much difference. Once the
consciousness ascends through manipura, you become master over some of
the situations of life, but you are still influenced and bound by your
prarabdha karma. You know that you can escape it, but you do not know
how.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The lower chakras belong to the empirical world of body, mind and
sense. People who accept their fate as inevitable have not yet
transcended mooladhara and swadhisthana chakras. Manipura is still
considered earthly, although it lies at the boundary between mortal and
immortal planes. Those who actively shape their own destiny through
strength of will channelled in a positive direction, which leads to
realization and achievement, are in the realm of manipura.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Anahata chakra is almost completely beyond these empirical dimensions.
Here, one realizes that fate is of course real, but still one can go
totally beyond its dictates. It is like throwing something into the sky.
If you are able to hurl that object right out of the gravitational
field, then it will no longer be pulled down by the earth's magnetic
forces. Just as a rocket is launched at tremendous speed in order to go
beyond the gravitational pull of the earth, so the consciousness is
accelerated in anahata to the speed of free will in order to transcend
the pull of latent samskaras.]{.class-0}

[It is only when you reach anahata chakra that you become a yogi. Up

are a yoga practitioner. In anahata you become a yogi because you are

the power of your own consciousness, rather than on anything that is
external or concerning faith.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Wish fulfilment
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In anahata chakra, the freedom to escape from a preordained fate and to
determine one's own destiny becomes a reality. According to the tantras,
at the root of anahata there is a wish-fulfilling tree known as the
[kalpa]{.class5827-0} [taru]{.class5827-0} or [kalpa]{.class5827-0}
[vriksha]{.class5827-0} . When this tree starts to fructify, whatever
you think or wish comes true. Ordinarily we have many wishes, but they
rarely assume more than the air of a daydream. However, if they were all
to become realities, we would quickly start to question whether we want
our wishes fulfilled at all. Most people prefer to depend on fate rather
than take responsibility for creating their own destiny, and well they
should. There is a fine story which is often told to illustrate this.

[Once a traveller was sitting underneath a tree. He was feeling very
tired and wanted to have a drink. So he thought of a clear stream, and
immediately he heard the trickle of water flowing beside him. After
drinking some water, he thought he would like to have a little food to
satisfy his hunger, and that appeared beside him also. Then, as he was
feeling tired and thought he would like to rest, there appeared before
him a nice bed, and so he went to sleep. The foolish man did not know
that he had come to rest beneath the wish-fulfilling tree. In the
evening when he awoke, the sun had already set and night had fallen. He
got up and the thought came to his mind: "Oh, it is terribly dark,
perhaps the tigers will come and eat me," and so they did.]{.class-0}

developing angina pectoris," or a pain in the abdomen and think: "Now I
have appendicitis or gall bladder disease," such thoughts may bring many
problems and disorders in their wake. You must also guard against doubts
concerning others: "Maybe that man is my enemy," "My son is sick, maybe

When anahata chakra blooms and awakens, you must have very good

people who depend on their fate. Rather, you should always associate
with those who depend on faith. You must have unswerving faith in the
power of your own will. Even in the face of tremendous odds, be
unflinching, then you will succeed. Willpower is never the outcome of
suggestion. If you are ill and you say a hundred times, "I am well, I am
well, I am well . . .," this is called autosuggestion. It is not will.
Will is something more than this. "Even if my son is suffering from the
worst disease and medical science has declared that he is about to die,
I know he will not." This is how you have to think and use your will.

Love without expectations
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Anahata chakra awakens refined emotion in the brain and its awakening is
characterized by a feeling of universal, unlimited love for all beings.
Of course, there are many people in the world who practise kindness and
charity, but they have selfishness. Their charity is not an expression
of anahata chakra and spiritual compassion, it is human compassion. When
you have human compassion you open hospitals and feeding centres or you
give clothing, money and medicine in charity, but that is human charity.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[How can we tell the difference between human charity and spiritual
charity? In human charity there is always an element of selfishness. If
I want to make you a Hindu by giving you things, this is a manifestation
of human charity. Or if I want to make you my followers I can show you
great kindness, but that is human kindness. However, when anahata
awakens all your actions are controlled and ruled by unselfishness and
you develop spiritual compassion. You understand that love does not
involve bargaining; it is free of expectation.]{.class-0}

[Every form of love is contaminated by selfishness, even the love you

are so great, her love has minimum selfishness.]{.class-0}

[In India there is a traditional pilgrimage in which sadhakas go north
to the source of Ganga, take some water from there and carry it across

water over a shivalingam. The distance they have to cover in this
pilgrimage is almost three thousand miles.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Once a saint had almost completed this pilgrimage and he was carrying a
container full of Ganga water. As he entered the precincts of the temple
where he was to bathe the shivalingam, he found a donkey which was
desperately pining for water. Immediately he opened his can and gave
water to the donkey. His fellow travellers cried out, "Hey, what are you
doing? You have brought this water such a long way to give a bath to
Lord Shiva and here you are giving it to an ordinary animal!" But the
saint did not see it that way. His mind was working at a different and
much higher frequency.]{.class-0}

[Here is another example: Once Lord Buddha was going for an evening

sufferings of old age. Next he saw a dead person, and again he was moved
very much. How many times do we see old people? Are we moved in the same
way that Lord Buddha was? No, because our minds are different. Awakening

Love overcomes ego
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Anahata chakra can be aroused and awakened by the practice of bhakti
yoga, in which there is no place for egotistical consciousness. Your
devotion can be for God or guru. It is easy to practise devotion to God
because he does not check your ego, or even if he does, you do not know
it. But when []{#part0031.xhtml_page_171} you practise devotion to the
guru, the first thing he does is 'egodectomy'. So when you direct your
devotion to guru, you have lots of difficulties. If you only meet your
guru from time to time, the problems are invisible, but if you live with
him, the problems are greater. Therefore, many people think it is safer
to have a guru who is no longer living.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Not only is ego an obstacle on the spiritual path, it is also the
greatest barrier to harmony and cordiality in family and social life.
Therefore, in order to treat the ego there are two very important paths.
One is karma yoga and the other is bhakti yoga. Ego can never be removed
by intellectual persuasion. It can never be subdued or eliminated unless
you develop the highest form of love. Just as the sun removes darkness,
love removes ego. These two can never coexist.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[So, in order to induce anahata awakening we should definitely practise
bhakti yoga. When kundalini is established in anahata there is absolute
devotion and even a confirmed atheist will change. However, awakening of
anahata is not only a way to God or guru, it is also a way to complete
unity and harmony in family life. Therefore, in India, most Hindu women
are initiated into bhakti yoga at a very young age. When they are four
to six years old they are taught to practise devotion to Lord Shiva,
Krishna, Rama, Vishnu, Lakshmi, Durga and so on, because it is easier
for women to develop anahata chakra. For this reason, women are also
told to use anahata as their centre for meditation, whereas men are
generally advised to concentrate on ajna chakra. Anahata is the seat of
human love and the seat of divine love. They are not two things, they
are one and the same.]{.class-0}

Psychic propensities of anahata chakra
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Prior to the awakening of anahata there may be frequent pain in the
chest or irregular functioning of the heart, such as accelerated pulse.
However, rather than feeling ill, one feels healthy and active and
requires little sleep. One obtains complete emotional balance and the
ability to communicate externally as well as internally. Voices or
sounds coming from []{#part0031.xhtml_page_172} other realms may be
heard, and buzzing or humming sounds and the music of a flute may be
experienced.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The sadhaka may become an inspired poet, artist or singer. He may
manifest clairvoyant/clairaudient or psychokinetic ability, or he may be
able to conquer people by the immensity of love he emits. A person in
anahata is generally very sensitive to the feelings of others and his
sense of touch is strongly developed. He also has the ability to heal
others, either by touch or by generating his own spiritual energy to
other people. Many people who perform miraculous healings do so through
the agency of anahata chakra.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class202 lang="en-us"}
[With anahata awakening one develops non-attachment to worldly things
and a constant feeling of optimism, understanding that good and bad
coexist, but there is also a world beyond this duality. After ridding
oneself of attachment, the mind becomes relaxed, free and peaceful. And
with the discovery of true freedom, pleasures of dualistic life become
meaningless.]{.class-0}

Nectar and poison
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In the tantric scriptures it is said that within bindu at the back of
the head, the moon is secreting a vital fluid or essence known as
nectar. This transcendental fluid drips down into the individual
consciousness from bindu. Bindu can be regarded in this context as the
centre or passage through which the individuality emerges from cosmic
consciousness in sahasrara.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[This divine fluid has many different names. In English it can be termed
ambrosia -- the nectar of the gods. It is also known as amrit -- the
nectar of immortality. In the Vedas it is known as soma and in the
tantras it is referred to as madya (divine wine). Many of the great Sufi
poets refer to the sweet wine which brings instant intoxication. The
same symbolism is contained in the Christian rituals where wine is
consecrated and sacramentally imbibed. In fact, every religious system
and mystical tradition concerned with awakening higher consciousness has
its own symbolism for the unspeakable and indescribable feeling of
bliss.]{.class-0}

chakra. When the nectar trickles down from bindu it is stored in lalana.

nasopharynx, the inner cavity above and beyond the soft palate into

downward unimpeded, to be consumed in the fire of manipura,]{.class-0}

retained and utilized, becoming the nectar of immortality. The secret of
youth and regeneration of the body lies in the awakening of
vishuddhi.]{.class-0}

[There is a wonderful story from the mythology of India which concerns
the nectar and poison of vishuddhi. It is said that in the primordial
past, the devas and the rakshasas, symbolizing the forces of good and
evil, were continually fighting each other. Each was seeking to dominate
and destroy the other. Eventually Vishnu attempted to resolve the
conflict. He suggested they stir up the primordial ocean (representing
the world and the mind), and said they could divide the contents equally
between them.]{.class-0}

[This seemed a fair solution and Vishnu's plan was agreed upon. The
ocean was churned and many things came to the surface for sharing and
distribution between the devas and rakshasas. In all, fourteen things
arose, including the nectar of immortality side by side with the worst
poison. Of course, both the devas and the rakshasas wanted the nectar,
but nobody wanted anything to do with the poison. Ultimately only the
devas got the nectar, because if it had been given to the vicious
rakshasas they would have become immortal. The poison could not even be
discarded, for wherever it was thrown it would cause harm. A great
dilemma arose and eventually Vishnu took the poison to Shiva to ask his
advice. Shiva swallowed the poison in a single gulp. From that time

blue-throated one, and he is often depicted in this way.]{.class-0}

Vishuddhi is the centre responsible for receiving thought vibrations
from other people's minds. This actually occurs through a minor centre
which is closely connected with vishuddhi. It acts somewhat like a
transistor radio tuning into a radio station, allowing the yogi to tune
into the thoughts and feelings of people both close by and far away. The
thought waves of others are also experienced elsewhere in the body, in
other centres such as manipura, but the actual reception centre of
thought waves and transmissions is vishuddhi. From vishuddhi they are
relayed to the centres in the brain associated with the other chakras,
and in this way they enter into the individual awareness.

elevation or point like an island in the middle of a lake. In the
psychophysiological framework, this tiny point is considered to be
bindu.

[The actual isolation of such a miniscule structure within the anatomy
of the brain has never been reported or verified by medical scientists.
However, such a study could prove both interesting and rewarding, in the
same way that modern research into the mysterious pineal gland has
verified that it is the anatomical and functional concomitant of ajna
chakra, as described in the tantra shastras. However, it is easy to
imagine that such a delicate and minute structure as the bindu would
undoubtedly be disrupted during post mortem procedures. Certainly the
tiny amount of fluid could hardly be expected to remain localized for
easy extraction and analysis, when it is well known that other more
plentiful neural and glandular transmitters and secretions degenerate
and disperse into the tissues at the time of death. Nevertheless it is
certainly a possibility to be considered.]{.class-0}

Traditional symbology
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In the tantric scriptures, the symbol of bindu is a crescent moon on a
moonlit night. This symbol is very rich in meaning. The crescent moon
indicates that bindu is closely related to the [kalas]{.class5827-0}
(phases) of the moon, as are the endocrine, emotional and mental
fluctuations of human beings. The immensity of sahasrara is gradually
unveiled through ardent yoga practice in the same way that the full moon
is progressively revealed from the time of the new moon to full moon
each month. The background of the night sky also symbolizes the infinity
of sahasrara beyond []{#part0033.xhtml_page_183} bindu. However,
sahasrara cannot be fully experienced while individuality remains.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The symbol of]{.class-0} [Om]{.class5827-1}
![](image1373.jpg){.class1374} [also contains the representation of
bindu in its uppermost part, which is a small point above a crescent
moon. In fact, all the chakras are symbolized within the body of the Om
symbol, as are the three gunas or qualities of the created world: tamas,
rajas and sattwa. These chakras exist in the realm of prakriti and its
gunas. In the Om symbol, bindu, however, is placed separately from the
main body to indicate that it is transcendental and beyond the fetters
of nature.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Bindu belongs to the seventh or highest loka of satyam, the plane of
truth, and it also belongs to the causal body, or]{.class-0} [anandamaya
kosha]{.class5827-1} [. It is said that when bindu awakens, the cosmic
sound of Om is heard and one realizes the source of all creation,
emanating from the bindu point and crescent moon above the symbol of
Om.]{.class-0}

The seat of nectar
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In many of the tantric texts it is written that bindu, the moon,
produces a very intoxicating secretion. Yogis can live on this ambrosial
fluid. If its secretion is awakened and controlled in the body, then one
needs nothing more for survival. The maintenance of the body's vitality
becomes independent of food.

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[There have been many reports of people who have entered into states of
hibernation or suspended animation underneath the earth. This phenomenon
has been verified many times under strict scientific observation. This
human hibernation has been witnessed for periods as long as forty days.
Not all cases have been genuine, but when authentic, they have been
carried out exactly in the following manner. Initially pranayama is
practised assiduously, until kumbhaka (retention of the breath) has been
perfected. At this stage, khechari mudra is performed. This is not the
simple form of khechari as performed in kundalini yoga sadhana, but the
practice from the hatha yoga tradition in which the root]{.class-0}

:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[By this practice, the drops from bindu fall to vishuddhi and
subsequently permeate the whole bodily system. These drops of nectar
maintain the nutrition and vitality of the bodily tissues while
simultaneously arresting the metabolic processes of the body. When the
metabolism of the cells and tissues of the body is suspended in this
way, oxygen is no longer required and cellular wastes are not produced.
Therefore, the person who hibernates can live without breathing for
quite an extended period of time. Even the facial hair does not grow
during the period of hibernation.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
The poison centre
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Besides producing nectar, bindu is responsible for the production of
poison. The poison gland and the nectar glands are almost simultaneously
situated. You may wonder if by awakening bindu there is any danger in
stimulating the poison glands. If bindu and vishuddhi are stimulated at
the same time, there is absolutely no danger, because bindu controls the
nectar glands and vishuddhi has a bearing on both nectar and poison. As
long as nectar is flowing, the poison can do no harm. Furthermore, if a
yogi has purified his body through hatha yoga and the practices of
dhyana and raja yoga, the poison glands are utilized for the production
of nectar.

The origin of individuality
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Bindu is considered to be the origin of creation or the point where
oneness first divides itself to produce the world of multiple individual
forms. This aspect of bindu can be traced to the Sanskrit root
[bind]{.class5827-0} , which means 'to split' or 'divide'.

and nothingness, coexist.]{.class-0}

[Within bindu is contained the evolutionary potential for all the myriad
objects of the universe. Bindu contains the blueprint for creation.
Evolution here refers to the vertical, transcendental process by which
life, objects and organisms arise from the underlying substratum of
existence. This evolution is not at all the same as the scientific
concept of Darwinian evolution, which is but an historical trace of the
changes over a period of time in the form, function or appearance of
particular manifestations of individuality, such as the species of
plants or animals. That evolution is an historical record over time,

individuality is in the realm of the timeless.]{.class-0}

[Some of the centres of manifestation from bindu possess consciousness,
such as man. However, most centres are unconscious, such as the
elements, stones, and so on. The potential to be conscious or

that allows him to be a conscious centre.]{.class-0}

pravritti (outward) path looks away from bindu towards the outside
world. He is almost entirely motivated by external events. This is the
path of most people today and it leads away from self-knowledge and into
bondage. The other path, the nivritti (reversed) path, is the spiritual
path, the path of wisdom. On this path the individual begins to face the
bindu, turning in towards the source of his being. This path leads to
freedom. The path of evolution is the pravritti path of manifestation
and extroversion. The path of involution leads back along the path that
has produced your individual being. It leads back through the bindu to
sahasrara. In fact, the whole purpose of yoga practice is to help direct
your awareness along the involutionary path.]{.class-0}

The power of the point
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
There is tremendous power ensheathed within the infinitesimal point. For
example, one theory about the origin of the universe suggests that an
infinitely dense point of matter exploded in a 'big bang' to form the
entire cosmos. Similarly, research in subatomic physics has revealed
that vast amounts of power are found concentrated within the
multitudinous and different subatomic particles existing in the
space/time continuum. Physics is now moving into the realms of the
ineffable bindu.
:::

RNA molecules, each one of which contains the complete genetic blueprint
for the entire organism. This]{.class-0} []{#part0033.xhtml_page_187

potential which can be condensed and expressed in the confines of a tiny

the history of mankind. In tantra, each bindu, each particle of
manifested existence is regarded as a centre of power or shakti. This

consciousness. The aim of the tantric system is to bring about a fusion
of Shakti -- the individual manifested power, with Shiva -- the inert,
underlying universal consciousness.]{.class-0}

The red and white bindu
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The bindu is the cosmic seed from which all things manifest and grow. It
is often related to male sperm because from the tiny bindu of a single
spermatozoon, joined with the minute female ovum, a new life grows. The
act of conception is a perfect symbol of the principle of the bindu. In
fact, bindu is explained in these terms in many of the texts of tantric
kundalini yoga. In the [Yogachudamani Upanishad]{.class5827-0} (verse
60) it says: "The bindu is of two types, white and red. The white is
[shukla]{.class5827-0} (sperm) and the red is [maharaj]{.class5827-0}
(menses)."
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Here the white bindu symbolizes Shiva, purusha or consciousness, and
the red bindu symbolizes Shakti, prakriti or the power of manifestation.
The white bindu lies in the bindu visarga and the red bindu is seated in
mooladhara chakra. The purpose of tantra and yoga is to unite these two
principles so that Shiva and Shakti become one.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The text continues (verse 61): "The red bindu is established in the
sun; the white bindu in the moon. Their union is difficult." The sun
represents pingala nadi and the moon represents ida. The two bindus
symbolize the merging of the world of opposites, in terms of male and
female. Out of their union results the ascent of kundalini. Again the
text continues]{.class-0} []{#part0033.xhtml_page_188 .class-0} [(verse

[All the systems of yoga control the prana in one way or another to
bring about this union. In some cases it is through direct control, as
in pranayama, while in other cases it is less direct. Nevertheless, the
meeting of these two polarities, Shiva and Shakti, leads to
superconsciousness. Verse 64 states: "He who realizes the essential
oneness of the two bindus, when the red bindu merges with the white
bindu, alone knows yoga."]{.class-0}

When kundalini shakti reaches sahasrara, that is known as union between
Shiva and Shakti, as sahasrara is said to be the abode of higher
consciousness or Shiva. Union between Shiva and Shakti marks the
beginning of a great experience. When this union takes place, the moment
of self-realization or samadhi begins. At this point the individual
dies. I do not mean that physical death occurs; it is death of the
mundane awareness or individual awareness. It is death of the experience
of name and form. At this time you do not remember the 'I', the 'you' or
the 'they'. The experience, the experienced and the experiencer are one
and the same. The seer, seeing and seen are merged as a unified whole.
In other words, there is no multiple or dual awareness remaining. There
is only single awareness.

Raja yoga, kundalini and samadhi
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In the [Yoga Sutras]{.class5827-0} of Patanjali you will not come across
the word kundalini, as this text does not directly deal with
[]{#part0034.xhtml_page_191} kundalini yoga. However, not every saint,
rishi or teacher has referred to kundalini by this name. Kundalini is
the subject matter of tantra. When Patanjali wrote the [Yoga
Sutras]{.class5827-0} 2,600 years ago, it was during the period of
Buddha and about four centuries before the great era of philosophers. At
that time, tantra had a very bad reputation in India because the gifts
of kundalini, the siddhis, were being misused for petty purposes and
people were being exploited. Therefore, tantra and tantric terminology
had to be suppressed, and in order to keep the knowledge alive, an
entirely different language had to be adopted.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In the raja yoga of Patanjali, emphasis is placed on the development of
a state called samadhi. Samadhi actually means supermental awareness.
First comes sensual awareness, then mental awareness, and above that is
supermental awareness, the awareness of your own self. The awareness of
forms, sound, touch, taste and smell is the awareness of the senses. The
awareness of time, space and object is mental awareness. Supermental
awareness is not a point; it is a process, a range of experience. Just
as the term 'childhood' refers to a wide span of time, in the same way,
samadhi is not a particular point of experience, but a sequence of
experiences which graduate from one stage to another.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Therefore, Patanjali classifies samadhi into three main categories. The
first is known as]{.class-0} [savikalpa]{.class5827-1} [samadhi, that
is, samadhi with fluctuation, and it has four stages:]{.class-0}
[vitarka, vichara, ananda]{.class5827-1} [and]{.class-0}
[asmita]{.class5827-1} [. The second category,]{.class-0}
[asamprajnata]{.class5827-1} [, is samadhi without awareness, and the
third category,]{.class-0} [nirvikalpa]{.class5827-1} [, is samadhi
without any fluctuation.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[These names only indicate the particular state your mind is in during
the samadhi experience. After all, the erosion in mental awareness does
not take place suddenly; the normal mental awareness does not come to an
abrupt end. There is development of one type of awareness and erosion of
another. The normal consciousness fades and the higher awareness
develops and, therefore, there is a parallel interaction between the two
states.]{.class-0}

[Where does meditation end and where does samadhi begin? You cannot
pinpoint it because there is an interspersion. Where does youth end and
old age begin? The same answer applies, and the same process happens in
samadhi as well. Where does savikalpa samadhi end and where does
asamprajnata begin? The whole process occurs in continuity, each stage
fusing into the next and transforming in a very graduated way. This
seems logical when you consider that it is the same consciousness which
is undergoing the experience.]{.class-0}

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In tantra it is said that when kundalini is ascending through the
various chakras, the experiences one has may not be transcendental or
divine in themselves, but they are indicative of the evolving nature of
consciousness. This is the territory of savikalpa samadhi, sometimes
illumined and sometimes dark and treacherous.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[From mooladhara up to ajna chakra, the awareness is experiencing higher
things, but it is not free from ego. You cannot transcend ego at the
lower points of awakening. It is only when kundalini reaches ajna chakra
that the transcendence begins. This is where the ego is exploded into a
million fragments and the ensuing death experience occurs. At this
point, savikalpa ends and nirvikalpa begins. From here, the energies
fuse and flow together up to sahasrara, where enlightenment
unfolds.]{.class-0}

until you have become a pure vegetarian.

purging process. The consumption of too much food will also make it
difficult to do most of the techniques properly, especially pranayama

discrimination in choosing the food that you eat. Remember that all

steps to cure your illness by any suitable means, possibly hatha yoga.
If necessary, write to this ashram, to any of our branch ashrams, or
contact any competent yoga teacher for guidance. If you suffer from any
serious mental or emotional problems, you should not, at present, start
the practices of kundalini yoga. Practise other types of yoga to bring
harmony into your life and mind, then start kundalini

:::

Time of practice
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The best time of day to do your [sadhana]{.class5827-0} (practice) is,
if possible, early in the morning, within the two hours before dawn.
This is known as [brahmamuhurta]{.class5827-0} in Sanskrit, 'the time
divine'. At this time spiritual energy is high and there are likely to
be fewer disturbances, both external and internal, than at any other
period of the day. However, if you are unable to practise during
brahmamuhurta, choose some other time when the stomach is empty. Do the
kundalini practices after other sadhana and before meditation practice.
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Place of practice
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Try to practise in the same place every day. This will gradually build
up a positive atmosphere which will be helpful for your sadhana. Your
place of practice should be []{#part0036.xhtml_page_200} clean, peaceful
and well ventilated. It should be dry and neither too hot nor too cold.
Do not practise on the bare floor; place a blanket or mat beneath you.
If necessary, wrap a blanket or sheet around you. Try to avoid the use
of fans, unless absolutely necessary.
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Clothing
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Clothing will depend on the prevailing climate, but it should be as
light, loose and comfortable as possible.
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Regularity
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Try to practise daily at a fixed time, without fail, following the
step-by-step program that we have given in this book. On certain days,
the mind may give justification for not practising, or it may be upset,
disturbed or restless. Providing there is no illness, you should
endeavour to do your practice as normal.
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Preliminary practices
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Before starting the kundalini yoga practices, try to empty the bowels
and take a cold shower. If you live in a cold climate, then at least
wash the face with cold water. This is essential in order to remove
sleepiness. It is a good idea to do a few asanas before commencing the
kundalini practices. If time does not permit, then at least do five to
ten rounds of [surya]{.class5827-0} [namaskara]{.class5827-0} , starting
slowly and then accelerating the pace. This should be followed by a
short period in [shavasana]{.class5827-0} until the breathing rate
returns to normal.
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Awareness
:::

::: {.class923 lang="en-us"}
If the mind flits here and there like a wild monkey, do not worry. Let
thoughts and emotions arise without suppression. Watch them with the
attitude of a witness and continue your practice. Gradually the mind
will become one-pointed. Whatever happens, your practice should
continue. This attitude of witnessing the mind without interfering can
be defined as awareness.

[M]{.class220-kfx-dropcap} ost of the practices for specific chakras and
the kundalini kriyas are done in a sitting position, or meditative
asana. The best sitting asana is [siddhasana]{.class5827-0} (for males)
and [siddha yoni asana]{.class5827-0} (for females). Not only do these
two asanas apply direct pressure on mooladhara chakra, but this
pressure, when applied correctly, brings about an awakening and
redirection of nervous energy and blood circulation upwards from the
pelvic and abdominal regions to the brain. This extra energy is
important in kundalini sadhana, since it keeps the voltage of prana
shakti at a high level. The perineal pressure awakens the source of
energy and actively distributes prana upward to the higher centres.

psychic centres upward through the spine, stimulating the brain and
calming the entire nervous system. The position of the lower foot at the
perineum presses mooladhara chakra, stimulating moola bandha, and the
pressure applied to the pubic bone presses the trigger point for
swadhisthana, automatically activating vajroli/sahajoli mudra. These two
psycho-muscular locks redirect sexual nervous impulses back up the
spinal cord to the brain, establishing control over the reproductive
hormones which is necessary in order to maintain brahmacharya for
spiritual purposes.]{.class-4}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Prolonged periods in siddhasana result in noticeable tingling sensations
in the mooladhara region which may last for ten to fifteen minutes. This

rebalancing of the pranic flow in the lower chakras.

chakra first. Unless this is achieved, then the awakening of the lower
chakras may rock the stability of the practitioner; one may experience
physical, mental and emotional shocks which one cannot bear. The
awakening of ajna chakra brings a great degree of detachment, which
allows one to withstand the lower chakra awakenings without excessive
shock. One is able to observe chakra experiences with the attitude of a

neti removes dirt and mucus from the nasal passages, relieving colds and
sinusitis, disorders of the eyes, ears, nose and throat, as well as
inflammation of the tonsils, adenoids and mucous membranes. It removes
drowsiness and gives a general lightness and freshness in the head and
throughout the body. At the same time, it profoundly alters psychic
awareness, facilitating free flow of breath in both nostrils, so that

Become aware of the triangular form of the breath between the nostrils
and the eyebrow centre. The base of the triangle is at the level of the
upper lip, its sides are the right and left nasal passages, and its apex
is within the eyebrow centre.
:::

Firstly, feel the breath moving in and out of the left nostril, then the
right nostril. Then be aware of the breath as it flows in and out
through both nostrils together.
:::

Once you are established in this breath awareness, begin to consciously
alternate the flow of the breath between the two nostrils in the same
way as nadi shodhana, except you practise it psychically or mentally.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Consciously inhale through the left nostril to bhrumadhya and exhale
through the right, then inhale through the right to bhrumadhya, and
exhale through the left.

This is one round of anuloma viloma or mental nadi shodhana. Complete 4
rounds.

Now practise one round of prana shuddhi, which involves breathing in and
out through both nostrils together.

Inhale and exhale through both nostrils simultaneously, visualizing the
passage of the breath forming an inverted V-shape.
:::

Continue in this way: four alternate nostril breaths, then one breath
through both nostrils.
:::

::: {#part0040.xhtml_page_214 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
In the beginning, the rounds can be counted as follows:

exhale left nostril,
:::

:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
5 -- inhale both nostrils, exhale both nostrils, and so on.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
After some practise, the rounds can be counted from 100 back to zero as
follows:

100 -- inhale left nostril, exhale right nostril; inhale right nostril,
exhale left nostril,
:::

[Practice note]{.class5829-0} [: Accuracy in the counting is absolutely
necessary, and if an error is made, the practice must recommence from
100. It is very important to keep count of the breaths, because without
keeping count, anuloma viloma is altogether too powerful for many

If you sink into the unconscious sphere, you will only be aware of the
vast store of impressions in the unconscious mind, and will completely
lose awareness of the practice. This awareness is essential for the
development of mind control and also for the awakening of ajna chakra to
conscious accessibility.

moves up or down, or from side to side, observe it and try to stabilize
it, without straining.

[Time of practice]{.class5829-0} [: The best times to practise trataka
are the dark hours of the very early morning or late at night. At these
times, the atmosphere becomes very still and quiet, not only the
physical atmosphere, but also the mental and psychic atmospheres. In
this stillness, success in trataka is readily attained.]{.class-4}
:::

::: {.class1508 lang="en-us"}
[Duration]{.class5829-0} [: Trataka can be practised as time permits,
but five to fifteen minutes is the usual period in the beginning,
building up to thirty minutes gradually over a period of time. Two to
three minutes per round is sufficient to spend gazing at the
flame.]{.class-4}

recommended for myopia, astigmatism, cataract or glaucoma.]{.class-4}
:::

::: {.class1508 lang="en-us"}
[Benefits]{.class5829-0} [: Trataka has many physical, mental and
spiritual benefits. Physically, it corrects eye weaknesses and defects
such as nearsightedness. Mentally, it increases nervous stability,
removes insomnia and relaxes the anxious mind. When the eyes are fixed
and unmoving, the mind becomes steady and calm. It helps to develop good
concentration and strong willpower. Spiritually it awakens ajna
chakra.]{.class-4}
:::

::: {.class1508 lang="en-us"}
[Variations]{.class5829-0} [: Trataka can be practised on a small dot,
the full moon, the rising sun, a shadow, a crystal ball, the nose tip,
an image in water, a yantra, darkness, a shivalingam and many other
things.]{.class-4}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Those who have a personal deity can practise trataka on his or her form
and those who have a guru can practise on his or her photograph. Trataka
can also be practised on one's own image in the mirror, or the eyes of
another person. These should, however, only be done under the guidance
of a guru, as there are certain risks involved.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Avoid practising trataka on the sun as the delicate membranes of the
eyes may be damaged.
:::

::: {#part0040.xhtml_page_217 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
There are two divisions of trataka, [bahiranga]{.class5827-0} (outer)
and [antaranga]{.class5827-0} (inner). The methods mentioned so far are
all part of bahiranga trataka. Inner trataka (antaranga) is internal
visualization, perhaps of a chakra, a yantra or your personal deity. The
eyes remain closed throughout. One of the best inner objects for
concentration is a tiny star or point of light.

not very difficult. It can be achieved by thousands of different
methods, but the easiest of all is the concentration on the tip of the
nose. This is because the part of the sensory cortex which represents
mooladhara chakra is connected with the nose. At the same time,
mooladhara chakra belongs to the earth element, which is directly
related to the sense of smell. Therefore, we shall include [nasikagra

[T]{.class220-kfx-dropcap} he sadhana for awakening swadhisthana chakra
is solely concerned with the uro-genital systems, the prostate gland and
testes in the male, and the genito-ovarian system in the female. Vajroli
and sahajoli mudras are two very powerful practices which rechannel
sexual energy and help bring about the awakening of swadhisthana.
Vajroli is practised by males and sahajoli by females. There are simple
forms of vajroli and also more difficult techniques which require the
direct guidance of a guru. However, the practices given here can be
performed with reasonable ease by anyone who is thoroughly familiar with
shalabhasana, dhanurasana and uddiyana bandha. Refer to 'Difference
between moola bandha, vajroli and ashwini mudras', given in [chapter
29](#part0041.xhtml) .

Preparatory practices
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
A large number of asanas have a direct effect on swadhisthana chakra and
help to bring about initial purification and sensitization. We suggest
that you practise shakti bandha series, bhujangasana, shashankasana,
dhanurasana and shashank bhujangasana.
:::

Practice program
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The sadhana (practices 1--4) for awakening swadhisthana chakra, should
be perfected over a period of one month. It should be kept in mind that
swadhisthana is the switch []{#part0042.xhtml_page_227} for bindu and,
therefore, the sadhana for swadhisthana also brings about a simultaneous
effect on and awakening of bindu. You can also continue the sadhana for
ajna and mooladhara chakras.

[T]{.class220-kfx-dropcap} here are several methods of awakening
manipura chakra. According to hatha yoga, manipura is directly connected
with the eyes. Ajna chakra and manipura chakra are very closely related
to one another in the same way that vision and wilful action are
interdependent processes. Therefore, the practice of trataka brings
about manipura and ajna chakra awakening.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Although tantra is not against any particular diet, when manipura
chakra is to be awakened, the diet has to be very pure, and at certain
stages, fasting may be necessary as well. If manipura is awakened when
the diet is faulty, harmful reactions may take place. Because manipura
is the centre of the digestive fire, disorders of the gastrointestinal
system are corrected by manipura sadhana.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The major constituents of manipura sadhana are uddiyana bandha and
nauli kriya. Uddiyana bandha is the contraction of the abdomen and the
control of the muscles of the abdominal wall, as well as control over
the small and large intestines and the other digestive and visceral
organs. The functions of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas and
stomach are brought into harmonious and controlled interaction when
uddiyana bandha is perfected. However, agnisar kriya must be mastered
before uddiyana is attempted.]{.class-0}

spiritual intelligence of the universe. All practices of yoga,
especially when done with the blessings of the guru, will automatically
awaken devotion in the spiritual heart (anahata chakra). There are many
excellent books on bhakti yoga that will help to inspire the aspirant to
follow this path. Any biographies of saints, yogis and bhaktas will also
be useful. An excellent description of the process of bhakti yoga is
given in our publication entitled,]{.class-0} [A Systematic Course in
the Ancient Tantric Techniques of Yoga and Kriya]{.class5827-1} [, and
in]{.class-0} [Bhakti Yoga Sagar]{.class5827-1} [, Volumes 1--5, by

Practise these techniques for anahata chakra for one month and then
begin those for awakening vishuddhi chakra. All the practices given for
awakening ajna, mooladhara, swadhisthana and manipura chakras can be
done if sufficient time is available. If not, then we suggest that you
do a few selected techniques from each chakra sadhana as follows:

:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Stand sideways in front of a mirror.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Put one finger of one hand on the centre of the chest.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Here you will find anahata kshetram.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Put one finger of the other hand on the spine, directly behind the
kshetram; this is anahata chakra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Sit down, press both fingers firmly for one minute, and then remove the
fingers.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The sensation at the chakra and kshetram will continue.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Concentrate on the sensation at the chakra and mentally repeat,
'anahata, anahata, anahata', for a few minutes.
:::

::: {.class1497 lang="en-us"}
[Practice 2: Anahata purification]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Assume a comfortable sitting posture. Hold the back straight but without
strain. Keep the eyes closed.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Breathe slowly and deeply, feeling the expansion and contraction of the
chest as you breathe in and out for some minutes.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then become aware of the breath moving in and out of the anahata region.
:::

::: {#part0044.xhtml_page_240 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
As the chest expands, feel that the breath flows in through the centre
of the chest and back to anahata chakra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
As the chest contracts, feel that the breath flows from anahata chakra
in the spine, through the centre of the chest and out of the body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Practise this for some minutes, mentally repeating, 'anahata, anahata,

[Practice 3: Bhramari Pranayama (humming bee breath)]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Sit in a comfortable meditative pose. Adjust your position and relax
fully for some minutes. Face forward.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Hold the head and spine as straight as possible.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Close the eyes.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Relax the whole body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Keep the teeth slightly separated and the mouth closed throughout the
entire practice.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
This allows the vibration to be experienced more distinctly in the
brain.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Plug the ears with the index fingers.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Breathe in slowly and deeply.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then, while breathing out, produce a humming sound.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The sound should be smooth and continuous for the full duration of
exhalation.
:::

::: {#part0044.xhtml_page_241 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
The humming need not be loud.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The important thing is that you hear the sound reverberating within your
head.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The exhalation should be slow and controlled.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
At the end of exhalation, stop the humming sound and breathe in fully.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Keep the eyes closed and the ears plugged.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Again repeat the humming sound with the next exhalation.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Try to relax fully during the practice.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Do not strain in any way.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Continue for 5 or 10 minutes.
:::

::: {.class1497 lang="en-us"}
[Practice 4: Ajapa japa meditation]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Sit in siddhasana, siddha yoni asana or any posture which feels
completely comfortable.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Close the eyes and relax for a few minutes.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now become aware of the natural breath as it enters and leaves the body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Do not try to control the breath, just become a witness of the natural
breathing process.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now become aware that the sound of inhalation is [So]{.class5827-0} and
the sound of exhalation is [ham]{.class5827-0} . The natural mantra of
the breath is [So-ham]{.class5827-0} . You have only to discover it.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Be simultaneously aware of the natural breath, coupled with the idea of
[So-ham-so-ham-so-ham.]{.class5827-0}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
You must be totally relaxed in this practice.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Do not lose awareness of the mantra or your natural breath, even for an
instant. Do not be concerned with the thoughts and feelings that arise.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Allow them to come and go as they will. Remain ever aware of the natural
breath and the ongoing mantra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now become aware of the psychic breath which is flowing in an imaginary
or psychic passage in the front of the body between the navel and the
throat, and between the throat and the navel.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
With inspiration, this psychic breath rises from the navel to throat and
its mantra is [So]{.class5827-0} . With expiration, the psychic
[]{#part0044.xhtml_page_242} breath descends from the throat back to the
navel. Its mantra is [ham]{.class5827-0} .
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Maintain awareness of the breath passing through the psychic passageway
and producing the sound [So-ham-so-ham-so-ham.]{.class5827-0}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Continue this practice for 10 or 15 minutes more, allowing your
breathing to be totally relaxed.
:::

::: {.class1508 lang="en-us"}
[Practice note]{.class5829-0} [: Ajapa japa can be practised at any

:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 1: Breath awareness]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Sit in siddhasana, siddha yoni asana or any other comfortable posture.
Close the eyes and relax completely for some time. Concentrate the
awareness in the throat region.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now become aware of the breath in the throat.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Only be aware of the sensation of the breath in the throat for some
time.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now add the awareness of the ingoing breath from the throat downwards.
You are not concerned with the outgoing breath. Your attention is
occupied only with the ingoing breath in the throat.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Become aware of the inflowing breath in the throat passing within the
network of the diaphragm.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Be aware of the diaphragm -- the rising and falling of the muscular
floor separating the chest and lungs above from the abdominal organs
below.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
With each inspiration, it drops into the abdomen a little, increasing
the pressure there and causing the navel to expand.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Simultaneously, the lungs are expanding fully in the chest.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Be aware that with expiration the abdomen contracts, the diaphragm is
rising and the lungs are emptying completely.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Develop awareness of the diaphragm for some time.
:::

::: {#part0044.xhtml_page_243 .class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 2: Awareness of the heart space]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now, also become aware of the akasha, the space within which the
diaphragm is operating.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
With the ingoing breath you feel this space is filling up.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Only be aware of the process of filling up the space.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
This process of filling up is only a basis for the awareness of this
vast space.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The process of feeling the breath is only the basis for experiencing the
heart space.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Become aware of the space in the heart; take your awareness directly
there.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Feel the space within the heart centre. It is contracting and expanding
with the rhythm of the natural breath.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Breath is only the basis.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The process of filling up is only the basis.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Go on to comprehend the whole space.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then you are aware of the space alone.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Feel the contraction and expansion of this vast space.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
It is taking place on the rhythm of the natural breath.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The breath is natural and spontaneous.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Do not alter it in any way.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Do not make it longer or shorter, deeper or more shallow, faster or
slower.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
It has to become a spontaneous and voluntary movement of breath.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
In this practice, the awareness of the space in the heart is important.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 3: Vision of blue lotus and lake]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
If the awareness of the expansion and contraction of the heart space is
constant and stabilized, after some time, many visions and experiences
will manifest there.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
You do not have to visualize or imagine anything. The vision will come
by itself when the awareness of the heart space is constant.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The image is of a lake and a blue lotus.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
If you are able to feel the space of the heart contracting and
expanding, then maintain your awareness there.
:::

::: {#part0044.xhtml_page_244 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
If that is not possible, then you will have to feel the breath which is
filling up the space. That is the first stage of the practice.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The second stage is the direct feeling of the space and its expansion
and contraction with the rhythm of the breath.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The third stage is the awareness of the blue lotus and the still lake.
It will come by itself.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Keep yourself ready for that experience.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 4: Ending the practice]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now become aware of the natural inflowing and outflowing breath in the
throat.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Withdraw your awareness from the heart space and bring it to the natural
breath in the throat.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Maintain awareness of the inflowing and outflowing breath in the throat
for some time.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Practise for five or ten minutes.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Chant Om three times.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Allow the sound to manifest fully and spontaneously from deep within.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
For a few minutes, listen carefully for the inner vibration of the
sound.
:::

::: {.class1564 lang="en-us"}
Release your posture and open your eyes.

[A minor chakra which is closely related to vishuddhi is called lalana
chakra, which is located at the back of the roof of the mouth, at the
soft palate, and it directly helps to awaken vishuddhi. For this reason,

direct stimulation. A simpler practice for awakening lalana is khechari

tiny point at the top of the back of the head, but this point cannot be
located in the physical body. It can only be found when the nada or
sound of bindu has been discovered and traced to its source. Through the
practices of [moorchha pranayama]{.class5827-0} and [vajroli/sahajoli
mudra]{.class5827-0} awareness of the nada can be developed. Then,

:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
This practice requires a steady and firm meditation posture, preferably
siddhasana or siddha yoni asana. Hold the spine and head upright and
relax the whole body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Perform khechari mudra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Inhale through the nostrils with ujjayi pranayama while simultaneously
bending the head backward and assuming shambhavi mudra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The inhalation should be slow and deep.
:::

::: {#part0046.xhtml_page_253 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
At the end of inhalation, the head should lean backward, but not
completely. The position of the head is as shown in the diagram. Retain
the breath inside for as long as is comfortable, maintaining shambhavi
mudra, but keeping the attention at bindu.
:::

the hands.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then bend the arms and slowly exhale with ujjayi pranayama as you bend
the head forward. Slowly lower and close the eyes.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
At the end of exhalation the head should face forward and the eyes

:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Each time you attain full contraction of the urinary system, bring your
awareness to swadhisthana chakra in the spinal column, at the level of
the coccyx. Repeat, 'Swadhisthana, swadhisthana, swadhisthana',
mentally.

::: {.class1497 lang="en-us"}
[Practice 3: Perception of subtle inner sound]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
This practice should be preceded by bhramari pranayama.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
In this stage no loud humming sound is produced, you only listen
attentively to the inner sound.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Keep the eyes closed and the fingers plugging the ears; this is
necessary to block out external disturbances.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Listen for any subtle sounds in the head.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
At first you may find this difficult, but keep trying.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
As soon as you become aware of a sound, any sound, try to fix your
awareness on it to the exclusion of other sounds.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Go on listening.
:::

::: {#part0046.xhtml_page_255 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
After some days or weeks of practice, you should find that one sound is
very distinct, and it will become louder and louder.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Be totally aware of that sound.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
This is your vehicle of awareness -- let your awareness flow towards
this sound, leaving all other sounds and thoughts.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Gradually, through practise, your sensitivity will increase.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Eventually you will hear another sound, a faint sound in the background;
it will be almost obliterated by the main, louder sound that you are
hearing, but you will hear it nevertheless.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now listen to the new faint sound.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Leave the other louder sound and continue to listen to the new sound. It
will become more and more distinct.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
This will become your new, more subtle vehicle of awareness.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Let this sound occupy your whole attention. This will further increase
your sensitivity of perception.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Eventually you will hear another faint sound emerging from behind this
louder sound.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Fix your awareness on this new sound, discarding the other sound.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Continue in the same manner, allowing the new sound to occupy your whole
awareness.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
When it becomes loud, try to perceive a more subtle underlying sound and
fix your awareness on it.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
In this manner your perception will become progressively more sensitive,
allowing you to dive deep into your being.
:::

::: {.class1508 lang="en-us"}
[Practice note]{.class5829-0} [: It requires practise over a period of
weeks and months to perceive these progressively more subtle sounds. For
many weeks you may be unable to hear even the first sound.]{.class-4}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
This is a very simple but powerful technique that will bring results if
you persevere. All that is necessary is time and effort. Try to practise
for as long as you have time. Begin with 15 minutes or more of bhramari
and this practice together.

Sit in siddhasana/siddha yoni asana, if possible. Otherwise take a
comfortable meditation asana and place a small cushion beneath the
perineum to provide pressure in this area. Hold the head and spine
straight.

Close the eyes and place the hands on the knees.

Raise the hands in front of the face, with the elbows pointing sideways.

Close the ears with the thumbs, the eyes with the index fingers, the
nostrils with the middle fingers, and the mouth by placing the ring and
little fingers above and below the lips.

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Release the pressure of the middle fingers and open the nostrils.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Inhale slowly and deeply, using full yogic breathing.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
At the end of inhalation, close the nostrils with the middle fingers.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Retain the breath for as long as is comfortable.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Try to hear any sounds emanating from bindu at the back of the head,
from the middle of the head, or perhaps the right ear.
:::

::: {#part0046.xhtml_page_257 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
At first you will either hear many sounds or none at all. Just continue
listening.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Retain the breath inside for as long as is comfortable.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then release the pressure of the middle fingers and slowly breathe out.
This is one round.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Inhale once more, close the nostrils, and retain the breath.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Listen to the inner sounds.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
After a comfortable length of time, release the nostrils and breathe
out. Continue in this way for the duration of the practice. During the
period of breath retention, your full awareness should be directed to
the perception of inner nada.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
At first there may be a confused jumble of sounds, but gradually you
will hear a specific sound. This may take a few days or weeks, but it
will be perceived.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
When you hear a distinct sound, be totally aware of it.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
It will become clearer and clearer. Keep your awareness fixed on the
sound. Listen very carefully.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
If your sensitivity is sufficiently developed, you will hear another
sound in the background. It may be faint, but perceptible.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Leave the first sound and transfer your awareness to the perception of
the fainter sound.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
In this way, you will transcend the first sound. Eventually this second
sound will overwhelm your whole attention.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Again, with practise and enhanced sensitivity, you will hear a further
sound start to emerge. It will be faintly perceptible behind the louder
second sound.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Direct your awareness to this new sound.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Carry on in this way -- perceive a sound and then discard it when you
can hear a more subtle sound. The more subtle the sound you perceive,
the deeper you will delve into the depth of your being.

Some people may find it easier to listen to the nada in the region of
the heart space (anahata chakra), especially those of a devotional
nature. The important thing is not so much the point of awareness, but
that the awareness remains fixed on progressively more subtle sounds.
Total absorption on the nada can lead to dhyana or the meditative state
of awareness.

behind each sound you discover and to go deeper, to reach the source of
all sound. Do not get lost or distracted by the beautiful sounds which
will manifest on your journey.]{.class-4}

Shanmukhi mudra is a more advanced practice than bhramari. It is

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Count the pulsation 21 times.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now begin to practise ashwini mudra, contraction and relaxation of the
anus.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Do not be concerned with ajna chakra, only practise ashwini mudra. It
should be practised at a medium speed, neither too quickly nor too
slowly.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
After practising like this for a few sessions, you should be able to
feel the centre of ajna automatically while performing ashwini.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
When that happens you can begin to concentrate directly on ajna.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Until then, practise ashwini mudra for about four minutes.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 3: Mooladhara awareness]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now bring your awareness to the perineal region and the psychic centre
of mooladhara chakra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Discover the precise psychic point of mooladhara chakra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Try to discover a subtle pulsation there.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Localize the pulsation very precisely in the mooladhara region and count
21 pulsations.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now open your eyes and adopt nasikagra drishti; gazing at the nose tip.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Do not be concerned with mooladhara chakra, but only with nose tip
awareness.
:::

::: {#part0047.xhtml_page_262 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
The simultaneous awareness of mooladhara chakra will come after some
time.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Continue this practice for three minutes.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 4: Swadhisthana awareness]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now bring your awareness to swadhisthana chakra in the region of the
tailbone.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}

Now perform vajroli/sahajoli mudra -- the drawing up and releasing of
the urinary system.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Continue vajroli/sahajoli mudra for four minutes.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 5: Manipura awareness]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now bring your awareness to the region of the navel.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Become aware of the psychic breath in the frontal passage from
mooladhara to the navel, and from the throat to the navel.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Both these breaths must reach the navel at the point of full inhalation.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
When the two forces meet and coincide at the navel, retain the breath
there, and develop the mental awareness of the single central point of
force in the navel.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then release the breath and continue this practice in your own natural
rhythm.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Continue for four minutes.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now take your awareness directly back to manipura chakra, within the
spinal column, directly behind the navel.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Try to isolate that point and the pulsation there.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Count the pulse 21 times in manipura chakra.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 6: Anahata awareness]{.class-3}
:::

Now bring your awareness to the region of anahata chakra in the spinal
column, at the level of the centre of the chest.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Isolate that point and try to discover a pulsation within it.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Count the pulsation 21 times.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now bring your awareness to the space of the heart.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
First become aware of the incoming breath in the throat.
:::

::: {#part0047.xhtml_page_263 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
With the incoming breath, feel the vast heart space expand.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Feel the heart space directly -- contracting and expanding with the
rhythm of the spontaneous, natural breath.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Be aware of the vision which will come in the vast heart space. Allow it
to come by itself.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Continue for two minutes.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 7: Vishuddhi awareness]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now bring your awareness to the throat pit and then take it directly
back to vishuddhi chakra in the spinal column.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Repeat mentally, 'Vishuddhi, vishuddhi, vishuddhi'.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Try to discover the pulsation within vishuddhi and witness it for 21
pulsations.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 8: Chakra awareness in sushumna]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now, as the name of each chakra is given, move your awareness within the
sushumna passage so as to touch each chakra mentally with a small
imaginary flower.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Your awareness of each chakra must be very precise -- mooladhara,
swadhisthana, manipura, anahata, vishuddhi, ajna; ajna, vishuddhi,
anahata, manipura, swadhisthana, mooladhara.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Guide the consciousness through the chakras in sushumna, ascending and
descending four more times.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 9: Ending the practice]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now begin to end the practice.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Bring the awareness back to the body and chant [Om]{.class5827-0} three
times.
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Practice 2: Musical chakra meditation
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Sound is a particularly effective and enjoyable means of developing
awareness of the chakras. This is why nada yoga is so powerful in
spiritual awakening. The seven notes of the musical scale correspond to
the vibration of the seven chakras from mooladhara to sahasrara, and
this is the basis for a very effective musical meditation technique. The
best instrument of all is the human voice, which can be supplemented by
the harmonium. However, other instruments such as the tampura and tabla
can also be used.

[Stage 1]{.class5840-1} [: At first the musical scale of the harmonium
is ascended very slowly while the awareness begins in mooladhara and
ascends sushumna from one chakra to the next, feeling each note vibrate
in the spinal column in the region of its corresponding
chakra.]{.class-4}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
When sahasrara is attained, descend the awareness with the musical scale
down through sushumna to mooladhara. The consciousness ascends and

chakra location becomes quick and effortless.
:::

::: {.class1508 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 2]{.class5840-1} [: Now the voice is integrated with the notes.
The names of the chakras are chanted very precisely. The names
themselves are mantras, and if intoned with the correct note and
pronunciation, each centre can be set vibrating, and the sushumna
passage and the whole body begin to vibrate with energy. This practice
is very powerful. It can be continued for ten minutes or
more.]{.class-4}

Practice 3: Chaturtha Pranayama (fourth pranayama)
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Chaturtha pranayama combines breathing, mantra and chakra awareness.
Although it is not widely taught, it is a powerful technique that is
both a pranayama and a meditation. This practice will lead to deeper
awareness and knowledge of the chakras. It is also a preparatory
technique for kriya yoga as it develops sensitivity to both the psychic
spinal passage and the chakras.

:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Mentally synchronize the manta [Om]{.class5827-0} with the breath.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The sound 'O' should synchronize with inhalation.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The sound 'm-m-m-m-m' should synchronize with exhalation. This sound
should only be mental.

Practice 4: Chakra yoga nidra
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Yoga nidra can be used very effectively to develop your awareness of the
chakras. Here is an example of a yoga nidra/relaxation session which
includes visualization and rotation of awareness through the psychic
centres. Teachers can adopt this practice directly for their classes.
For personal use, someone can lead you through the practice, or you can
put the instructions onto a tape.
:::

::: {.class1497 lang="en-us"}
[Technique]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}

:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Place a folded blanket on the floor and lie on it in shavasana.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Loosen your clothing so you feel perfectly comfortable. If necessary,
cover yourself with a blanket to keep warm, or put a sheet over you to
keep insects away.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The mouth and eyes should remain closed throughout the practice.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Make sure that the spinal column is straight, in line with the head and
neck, and that the hips and shoulders are fully relaxed.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Keep the feet and legs slightly apart.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The arms should be beside your body but not touching, and the palms
should be facing up.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Adjust your position so that you feel perfectly comfortable.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Tell yourself firmly that you will not move your body throughout the
practice.

[Stage 2: Sinking of the body]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Look at the space in front of your closed eyes.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Imagine that the space surrounds your whole body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Your body is immersed in that space.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Simultaneously be aware of your body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
It feels very light, as light as a leaf falling from a tree. Imagine
that your body is slowly sinking into the space that you see in front of
your closed eyes, like a falling leaf.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Your body is slowly sinking into the infinite space.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Be aware of this feeling.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Continue in this manner for a few minutes.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 3: Rhythmical breath awareness]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Become aware of your breathing.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Awareness of the rise and fall of the navel with each breath.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
As you breathe in, feel you are sucking in air through the navel.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
As you breathe out, imagine that you are pushing air out from the navel.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
It is a rhythmical process. Do not alter the natural breath in any way,
just become aware of it.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 4: Sankalpa]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Repeat your sankalpa in a short positive sentence.

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
It should be the crystallization of your spiritual aspiration and you
should not change it.

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Repeat it with feeling, from the heart, not the lips.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Repeat your sankalpa at least three times.

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now try to visualize your own body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Imagine that you are viewing it from outside.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Feel that your perception is outside and your body is an object of
study.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
You may find visualization difficult -- do not worry, just do your best.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
If you wish, you can imagine that there is a large mirror suspended over
your body and that your body is reflected in it.
:::

::: {#part0047.xhtml_page_268 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
Look at your own reflection.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
See your whole body: feet, knees, thighs, abdomen, chest, both hands,
arms, shoulders, neck, head, mouth, nose, ears, eyes, eyebrow centre,
your whole face and your whole body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Combine rotation of awareness of each part with visualization of that
part.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Continue in this manner for a few minutes.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 6: Psychic centres -- rotation of awareness]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now you have to discover the location of the chakras.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
You must develop awareness of each psychic centre .
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Start from the base of the spine and move your awareness upward.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
First become aware of mooladhara. In the male body it is situated in the
perineum, between the anus and genitals, and in the female body it is
located at the cervix -- the mouth of the womb.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Try to feel the sensation at mooladhara. It is a very specific point
which you are trying to isolate.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
When you have found it, repeat mentally, 'Mooladhara, mooladhara,
mooladhara'.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now move on to the second chakra, swadhisthana. It is located at the
base of the spine, in the coccyx.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Be aware of the sensation at that point and repeat mentally,
'Swadhisthana, swadhisthana, swadhisthana'.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The third chakra is manipura.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
It is located in the spine in line with the navel.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Feel this point and mentally repeat, 'Manipura, manipura, manipura".
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then become aware of anahata chakra, located in the spine, directly
behind the centre of the chest.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Try to locate that point exactly and mentally repeat, 'Anahata, anahata,
anahata'.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now bring your awareness to vishuddhi chakra, situated in the spine,
directly behind the throat pit.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Feel the sensation arising at that point and mentally repeat,
'Vishuddhi, vishuddhi, vishuddhi'.
:::

::: {#part0047.xhtml_page_269 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
The next chakra is ajna.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Ajna chakra is located at the very top of the spine in the region of the
pineal gland, directly behind the eyebrow centre.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Fix your awareness on that area and mentally repeat, 'Ajna, ajna, ajna'.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now bring your awareness to bindu, at the top back portion of the head.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Feel that tiny point as precisely as possible, and repeat mentally,
'Bindu, bindu, bindu'.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Finally, become aware of sahasrara, at the crown of the head, and repeat
mentally, 'Sahasrara, sahasrara, sahasrara'.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now repeat this process, slowly descending through the chakras in
reverse order: sahasrara, bindu, ajna, vishuddhi, anahata, manipura,
swadhisthana and mooladhara.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
This is one complete round of chakra rotation.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now start a second round: mooladhara, swadhisthana, manipura, anahata,
vishuddhi, ajna, bindu, sahasrara; sahasrara, bindu, ajna, vishuddhi,
anahata, manipura, swadhisthana, mooladhara.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
This completes the second round.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Begin a third round, this time a little faster.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
As you fix your attention at each point, try to feel a slight vibration
there, a tiny pulsation.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
If you wish, you can chant [Om]{.class5827-0} mentally as you locate
each point in turn.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}

[Stage 7: Psychic centres -- visualization]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now try to visualize the symbols of each chakra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
You can use your own personal system of psychic symbols or the
traditional chakra symbols as follows.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
As each chakra is named, try to feel that point being lightly pressed by
the thumb, and simultaneously visualize the symbol.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The psychic symbol for mooladhara is a deep red, four-petalled lotus.
:::

::: {#part0047.xhtml_page_270 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
Inside there is a smoky lingam around which a snake is coiled three and
a half times. The snake's head is facing upward.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Try to visualize this symbol to the best of your ability and associate
it with that particular location in the body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then proceed to swadhisthana chakra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The symbol is a six-petalled vermilion lotus, within which is depicted a
starry night above the sea. The main focal point is the crescent moon.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Try to visualize this symbol.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Move to manipura chakra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
It is symbolized by a ten-petalled yellow lotus, and in the centre is
blazing fire.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Visualize this symbol, imagining that the lotus is actually growing from
manipura chakra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Proceed to anahata chakra, represented by a twelve-petalled blue lotus.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
In the centre is a solitary flame burning in the darkness. Try to
visualize this symbol while feeling the exact position in the body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Move to vishuddhi chakra, symbolized by a sixteen-petalled purple lotus.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
In the middle there is a pure white drop of nectar.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Visualize this location in the body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then proceed to ajna chakra which is symbolized by a two-petalled
silver-grey lotus.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
On the left hand petal is the full moon and on the right hand petal, a
glowing sun.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
In the centre is a black lingam and an [Om]{.class5827-0} sign.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Create a mental image of this symbol and its exact location.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Move on to bindu. It is symbolized by a tiny white drop of nectar.
:::

::: {#part0047.xhtml_page_271 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
Visualize this symbol at the top back of the head.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Finally, move to sahasrara, the fountainhead of all the chakras.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
It is represented by a thousand-petalled lotus. In the centre is a white
lingam.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Visualize this symbol at the crown of the head.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Now visualize all these symbols in the reverse order: sahasrara, bindu,
ajna, vishuddhi, anahata, manipura, swadhisthana and mooladhara.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
This is the end of one round.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Spend a few seconds visualizing each centre.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Do a few more rounds according to the amount of time available.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 8: Eyebrow centre awareness]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Fix your attention at the eyebrow centre.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Feel your pulse at this point.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Become aware of its continuous rhythmical beat.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Mentally synchronize repetition of the mantra [Om]{.class5827-0} with
this pulse.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Continue for a few minutes.
:::

::: {.class1632 lang="en-us"}
[Stage 9: Sankalpa/Ending the practice]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Repeat your sankalpa three times with full emphasis and feeling.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Become aware of your natural breath.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Become aware of your whole physical body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Become aware of the outer sense perceptions.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Slowly begin to move your body. When you have fully externalized your
awareness, slowly sit up and open your eyes.
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Practice 5: Unmani mudra (attitude of mindlessness)
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Unmani mudra is an excellent practice for developing awareness of the
chakras in the spine, from bindu down to mooladhara. It is also an
integral part of many of the kriya yoga practices (nada, pawan and
shabda sanchalana, maha mudra and maha bheda mudra), and therefore it
should be mastered before attempting to learn and practise these
techniques.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The word]{.class-0} [unmani]{.class5827-1} [means, 'no mind' or
'thoughtlessness', and refers to the state which arises during
meditation. Therefore, unmani mudra means, 'the attitude of mindlessness
or thoughtlessness'.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {#part0047.xhtml_page_272 .class1497 lang="en-us"}
[Technique]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Sit in any comfortable meditation pose, preferably siddhasana/siddha
yoni asana or padmasana with the back straight.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Open the eyes fully, without focusing on anything external.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Take a deep breath in and, holding the breath inside, focus the
awareness at bindu.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
As you breathe out, imagine the breath going down the spine.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Simultaneously, let your awareness descend the spine, passing through
all the chakras: ajna, vishuddhi, anahata, manipura, swadhisthana,
mooladhara, one after the other.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The eyes should slowly close and be fully closed by the time the
awareness reaches mooladhara.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Although the eyes remain open throughout the practice, the attention
should be internalized on the chakras and breath; that is, the eyes are
open, but you are looking within. Do not try too hard, but allow the
process to occur spontaneously.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
This is one round.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Inhale deeply and begin the second round.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Do 11 rounds.
:::

::: {.class1508 lang="en-us"}
[Practice note]{.class5829-0} [: Physically this practice is very easy
to perform. The emphasis, however, should be on the mental process
taking place. When the eyes are open they should not register anything
outside.]{.class-4}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Practice 6: Beeja Mantra Sanchalana (conducting the seed sound)
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
This practice is one of the techniques of kriya yoga, but is not
normally one of the twenty kriyas that we teach. It is concerned with
mentally repeating the beeja mantra of each kshetram and chakra, one
after the other, whilst simultaneously moving the awareness through each
chakra.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The word]{.class-0} [beeja]{.class5827-1} [means 'seed', mantra means
'mystic sound' and sanchalana means 'conduction'. Therefore, this
practice can be called 'the conduction of the seed sound'.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {#part0047.xhtml_page_273 .class185 lang="en-us"}
Psychic passages
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In the following kriya, beeja mantra sanchalana, as well as in a number
of practices of kriya yoga, you will be required tomove your awareness
through two psychic passages called [arohan]{.class5827-0} and
[awarohan.]{.class5827-0} The path of these passages is as follows:
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Arohan]{.class5827-1} [, the ascending passage, goes from mooladhara
chakra, forward to swadhisthana kshetram in the pubic area, then follows
the curve of the belly to manipura kshetram, upward to anahata kshetram
and vishuddhi kshetram in the front of the throat, then in a straight
line to bindu at the top back of the head.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[There is also another pathway for the arohan psychic passage that has
been taught by tradition throughout the ages. On the ascent from
mooladhara, swadhisthana kshetram and onwards, the awareness is taken
from vishuddhi kshetram to lalana chakra in the palate, then to the
nosetip, to the eyebrow centre, and following the curvature of the skull
through sahasrara at the top of the head, to bindu at the back of the
crown, where there is a little whorl of hair. In this book we will refer
to the arohan passage as connecting vishuddhi kshetram directly to
bindu; however, you can experiment with both passages and use whichever
one suits you best.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Awarohan]{.class5827-1} [is the descending passage which starts at
bindu, travels forward to ajna chakra, then down through sushumna in the
spine, passing through all the chakras in turn to finally terminate at
mooladhara.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In the following practice you will have to familiarize yourself with
these two psychic passages, and this will also be useful as a
preparation for the kundalini kriyas.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Beeja mantras
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The beeja mantras for each kshetram and chakra are as follows:

[1. Mooladhara --]{.class-1} [Lam]{.class5827-2}

[Technique]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Sit in any comfortable position, preferably siddhasana/siddha yoni
asana.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Keep the head and spine straight and the eyes closed.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Throughout the practice there is no physical movement; the kriya is
performed mentally.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Bring your attention to mooladhara chakra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Repeat the mantra [Lam]{.class5827-0} mentally, once, and try to feel
the vibration at mooladhara chakra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then ascend through arohan.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Let your attention jump to swadhisthana kshetram and repeat the mantra
[Vam]{.class5827-0} , feeling the vibration at that point.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Jump to manipura kshetram and repeat the mantra [Ram.]{.class5827-0}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
At anahata kshetram, [Yam]{.class5827-0} .
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
At vishuddhi kshetram, [Ham.]{.class5827-0}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
At bindu, [Om]{.class5827-0} .
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then descend through awarohan.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Repeat [Om]{.class5827-0} at ajna, in the centre of the head.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Repeat [Ham]{.class5827-0} at vishuddhi chakra in the spine.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
At anahata chakra, [Yam.]{.class5827-0}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
At manipura chakra, [Ram]{.class5827-0} .
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
At swadhisthana, [Vam]{.class5827-0} .
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then return to the starting point, mooladhara, and begin the next round
by repeating the mantra [Lam]{.class5827-0} .
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Your awareness should jump from one centre to the next.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Do 9 rounds, or more if you have time.
:::

::: {.class1508 lang="en-us"}
[Practice note]{.class5829-0} [: Beeja mantra sanchalana is an excellent
preparatory practice for kriya yoga sadhana. You may also practise this
by spending some time, for example five minutes, at each kshetram or
chakra, chanting the mantra out loud on a low key and feeling it
vibrating at the chakra.]{.class-4}
:::

::: {#part0047.xhtml_page_275 .class185 lang="en-us"}
Practice 7: Drawing the chakras
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Drawing of mandalas, such as the chakras, is an important part of
tantra. Many of the practices require that the correct mandalas be
constructed first of all. The creation of a chakra diagram should be
done with absolute awareness and concentration, and its measurements and
dimensions must be exact. You should try to ensure that you will be
undisturbed for at least an hour, and approach the exercise as you do
meditation. In some Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, mandalas are drawn and
painted as part of the daily sadhana, as is the practice in several
Greek Orthodox monasteries, where icons are painted in minute detail as
daily meditation.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Make sure you have all the necessary materials; pencils, pens, rubbers,
ruler, compass, colours or paints, so that you will not have to disturb
your concentration once you have started. If you have a sadhana room,
then that is the best place to create your mandalas. A good size for
drawing the chakras on art paper is about 9" square, as this size is
most useful for visual display and concentration practices. Larger and
smaller sized chakras can be made for other purposes.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[By first using only a black pen, one can plainly see the simple yet
subtle lines and formations, and discover the hidden symbology as it
becomes visually clearer in the mind. The next step is to colour it,
according to the traditional colours described in the text. In this way,
mandalas of each of the seven chakras can be completed over seven or
more sessions.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[This practice is very relaxing and enjoyable. You may like to create
more subjective and artistic impressions of the chakras, with your own
colours and symbols, as you come to understand them in a personal way.
This expands your awareness to the many possibilities of experiencing
not only the chakras, but life itself.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The chakras should not be interpreted on just one or two levels, but in
many dimensions. After drawing and painting the chakras successfully,
you can then take the next step and create the chakras in a three
dimensional form. For this you]{.class-0} []{#part0047.xhtml_page_276
.class-0} [can use any number of materials such as clay, plasticine,
wire, fibreglass, copper or stone.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class202 lang="en-us"}
[You must remember, however, that the traditional drawings are as
subjective as your feelings and experiences of the chakra. Therefore,
use your own experiences to express the deeper and inner spiritual
aspects, on paper, in clay or stone, etc. Through this, you will find a
clarity of vision arising out of what once seemed a confused and blurred
picture of life.]{.class-0}

[These practices are all fully described in the chapters indicated and
it is essential that you master them. If you try to learn kriya yoga
without first of all perfecting them, then you will find the actual
kriya techniques very difficult to follow and you will get very little
benefit from them.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {#part0049.xhtml_page_281 .class185 lang="en-us"}
Mode of learning the kriyas
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
It is not possible to learn all the kriyas at once. Therefore, we
suggest that you learn each kriya sequentially, spending at least one
week mastering each kriya, and progressively adding each new kriya to
those already learned. That is, in the first week learn and master kriya
1: vipareeta karani mudra. Then in the second week, learn kriya 2:
chakra anusandhana, and do both 1 and 2 daily. In the third week, learn
kriya 3: nada sanchalana and do it daily, together with the previous two
kriyas. In this way, all the kriyas can be systematically and thoroughly
learned in a period of 20 weeks. However, it may take many months of
regular practice before the kriyas are perfected and remember kundalini
kriyas should be practised under guidance.
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
Length of practice
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
As you progressively add more and more kriyas to your practice program,
the time required for daily practice will increase. Eventually, after
mastering all the kriyas, your daily practice of the 20 kriyas, with the
required number of rounds, will take between two and two and a half
hours.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[If you can spare this amount of time every day, then you will get the
maximum benefit. However, most people, no matter how sincere, will not
be able to devote this length of time to their practice. Therefore, for
those who wish to practise kriya yoga, but have less spare time, we
suggest that you reduce the number of rounds per kriya as
follows:]{.class-0}

[This daily program containing all the kriyas, with a reduced number of
rounds, will take a total of about one to one and a half hours. The
benefits may be slightly less than when you do the complete number of
rounds per kriya, but still you will reap much fruit from your
practise.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}

Hints on practice
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The following suggestions will help you to master the kriyas and gain
maximum benefit:
:::

::: {.class793 lang="en-us"}
[1. Do not strain physically or mentally under any circumstances, or you
may experience negative side effects. This applies particularly in the
case of kriyas such as maha mudra, maha bheda mudra, tadan kriya,
naumukhi and shakti chalini. Regular daily practice will gradually bring
such changes into the mind and body, so that after some time, you will
be able to practise the kriyas almost effortlessly.]{.class-1}
:::

::: {.class793 lang="en-us"}
[2. Do not hold your breath for longer than is comfortable. In many of
the kriyas, such as maha mudra and maha bheda mudra, most people will
initially find difficulty in completing a full round in one respiration
cycle]{.class-1} []{#part0049.xhtml_page_283 .class-1} [without strain
or suffocation. In the beginning, it may be necessary to break in the
middle of each round, or to take a short rest at the end of each round
and take a few normal breaths. As you develop the capacity to hold the
breath for longer periods, and to control inhalation and exhalation,
this concession may be disregarded.]{.class-1}
:::

::: {.class793 lang="en-us"}
[3. After long inner breath retentions, it is best to breathe in
slightly before breathing out. In many of the kriyas, such as maha
mudra, maha bheda mudra, naumukhi and shakti chalini, where the breath
is held inside for prolonged periods, there is a tendency for the lungs
to lock. The best way to overcome this problem and release the lungs is
to breathe in slightly before breathing out. This will make the kriyas
much easier to do.]{.class-1}
:::

::: {.class3266 lang="en-us"}
[4. While learning each kriya, check that you are doing all the steps
and that they are being done correctly.]{.class-1}
:::

[The Kriya Yoga Practices](#part0006.xhtml_k-4pqyFpS4aI3ekXWdsL9A5959)
:::

::: {.class2767 lang="en-us"}
By tradition there are a total of 76 kundalini kriyas of kriya yoga. We
present the following 20 main practices, which are sufficient for the
daily practice of any sincere sadhaka.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[These practices are divided into three groups:]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class793 lang="en-us"}
[1. those which induce pratyahara]{.class-1}
:::

::: {.class793 lang="en-us"}
[2. those which induce dharana]{.class-1}
:::

::: {.class793 lang="en-us"}
[3. those which induce dhyana]{.class-1}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
It should be noted that these three states are actually a continuity of
evolution, that is, the consciousness flows from one to the next without
any apparent dividing point -- so these practices should be done in an
unbroken sequence. Of course, from the first day, the practice of these
kriyas will not necessarily lead to such exalted states of awareness,
but if they are practised properly with correct guidance, by an aspirant
who is ready for them, then most likely, one day they will. It will be
at that stage that the constant, unbroken progression of awareness will
become essential. Remember, you should learn one kriya per week.

:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The chin should not touch the chest.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Practise subtle ujjayi pranayama Be sure that the legs are completely
vertical. Close the eyes.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Inhale with ujjayi and simultaneously feel a hot stream of amrit or
nectar flowing through the spinal passage from manipura chakra to
vishuddhi in the throat. The nectar will collect at vishuddhi.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Retain the breath for a few seconds, and be aware of the nectar
remaining at vishuddhi and becoming cool.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then exhale with ujjayi, sensing the nectar travelling from vishuddhi
through ajna, bindu and to sahasrara.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The sensation is that of the nectar being injected with the help of the
breath.
:::

::: {#part0051.xhtml_page_286 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
After exhalation, immediately return your awareness to manipura and
repeat the kriya to bring more nectar down to vishuddhi, and finally to
sahasrara.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Practise 21 respirations or rounds.

:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Assume siddhasana/siddha yoni asana or padmasana.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The eyes remain closed throughout the practice.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Breathe normally.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
There is no connection between the breath and the consciousness in this
practice.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Bring your awareness to mooladhara chakra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Your consciousness will slowly ascend the frontal passage of arohan from
mooladhara to the frontal point of swadhisthana at the pubic bone,
manipura at the navel, anahata at the sternum, the chest centre,
vishuddhi at the throat and across to bindu at the top, back of the
head.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
As you travel upward, mentally repeat, 'mooladhara, swadhisthana,
manipura, anahata, vishuddhi, bindu', as you pass through these centres.
:::

::: {#part0051.xhtml_page_287 .class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then let your awareness slip down the spinal awarohan passage from bindu
to mooladhara, mentally repeating 'ajna, vishuddhi, anahata, manipura,
swadhisthana, mooladhara' as you pass through these centres.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
From mooladhara, immediately start ascending in the frontal passage as
before, mentally reciting the chakra names as you ascend, starting with
swadhisthana.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Continue this rotation of awareness through the chakras in a constant
flow of rounds.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Do not make a serious, tense effort to locate the chakras as you pass
through them. Merely glance at them as you go by, as you would view the
scenery from a fast moving train.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
If you wish, you can visualize your awareness in this kriya as a thin
silver serpent travelling in an ellipse within your body.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Practise 9 rounds.
:::

::: {.class1497 lang="en-us"}
[3: Nada Sanchalana (conducting the sound consciousness)]{.class-3}
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Sit in siddhasana/siddha yoni asana or padmasana.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Exhale completely.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Open the eyes and bend the head forward, so that it drops downward in a
relaxed manner. The chin should not press tightly on the chest.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Bring the awareness to mooladhara chakra.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Repeat mentally, 'mooladhara, mooladhara, mooladhara'.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Then, as you inhale, your consciousness should rise up through the
frontal passage of arohan to bindu.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
Have a clear awareness of swadhisthana, manipura, anahata and vishuddhi,
as you pass through them on your way to bindu, and mentally repeat their
names.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
As your awareness travels from vishuddhi to bindu during the last
segment of your inhalation, your head will slowly rise and tilt back
slightly into position facing about 20 degrees above the horizontal.
With the breath retainedinside and the awareness at bindu, mentally
repeat, 'bindu, bindu, bindu'.

The power of the awareness will build up as you are repeating the word
'bindu' and it will explode into the vocal chant of [Om]{.class5827-0} ,
which will carry you down through the spinal passage of awarohan to
mooladhara.
:::

::: {.class1499 lang="en-us"}
The 'O' sound will explode and move downwards, culminating almost in a
vibrating m-m-m sound as you approach mooladhara.

[One of the great traps in attempting to research yoga is to design
experiments without a thorough knowledge of yoga itself. This is like
looking at only a small part of the whole, just as the six blind 'wise'
men, who each examined a different part of an elephant and then
pronounced their judgements based on these limitations, could never
understand the whole elephant and how it looked. Yogic training requires
many years and the skilled guidance of a master to discover its basic
principles, its mode of application, and to prepare oneself for the
experiences arising from this training.]{.class-0}

The totality of man
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Perhaps the outstanding feature of yoga is its ability to give us a more
total picture of who we are, to put the various elements into a simpler
and at the same time more sophisticated []{#part0055.xhtml_page_320} and
more expanded perspective. Yoga also teaches us that within us all there
is a vital power, a basic essence, whose thread can be seen running
through life, unmeasurable by even the most sophisticated machines, but
palpable and motivating our living, breathing, thinking, body and mind.
We can see its effects and measure the forms and changes of this subtle
energy as it enters and interacts with the physical domain, in the
nerves, in the chemical and intracellular processes and in the flows and
pressures of the body. However, the energy itself is still undefined
scientifically.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Through yogic sadhana we can experience the subtle energy, called prana
or kundalini, which underlies all matter. This experience is a
transformative one, which makes the subtle more tangible and real than
the material and so-called solid, physical universe. It shifts our
perspective, broadens our awareness and awakens our consciousness, our
higher and greater self. It awakens us to the fact that within us all is
an immortal and eternal essence, full of knowledge, bliss and
truth.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The very fact that such an experience exists alters our direction and
purpose. We see that we are here not only for sensual and mundane
satisfaction, but for a higher and greater destiny. This ultimate goal
of yoga must always be remembered when we are researching yoga, for we
know that yoga can give us relaxation, alter our brain waves and
hormonal secretions, endow us with health, induce concentration and
better memory, help us to develop better human interrelationships and to
enjoy everything we do, to have fun and fulfil ourselves in a balanced,
healthy way. However, we must see that these things, though they are all
worthy and good in themselves, are not the ultimate goal of yoga, but
are side-effects of our pursuit of higher awareness and deeper knowledge
of the truth of our existence. To pursue these things in themselves is
another trap, a trick of the mind. For they do not exist by themselves
but are the outcome of a complete process of living. The yogic process
of total development of body, mind and spirit, ida, pingala
and]{.class-0} []{#part0055.xhtml_page_321 .class-0} [sushumna, is the
most systematic way to attain these things and more.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Yoga is not a science of healing and does not need to look into the
negative side of existence. The teachings tell us to practise and
emphasize the good, positive and healthy in us and automatically we will
be healthy and happy. There is nothing difficult to understand in this.
If we emphasize exercise, moderation, good lifestyle, relaxation,
meditation and self-discipline, then we are sure to achieve something
worthwhile in life. Research into relaxation, meditation, asana and
pranayama continues to demonstrate that yoga exerts real changes in the
body and mind, that it can only be a worthwhile addition to our lives if
performed under guidance and done correctly. However, we must remember
that it is much more than that, and that all our achievements are
ultimately, and in the last analysis, useless if we do not transform the
quality of our awareness.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Yoga tells us to awaken our minds, to develop the energy within
ourselves so that we can attain a much greater, fuller and more total
existence. Evidence is piling up to show that there is a psychic side to
our lives, that the mental and intangible is far from imaginary, but is
powered by an energy, a subtle force which can be tapped and developed
and which can totally change and transform the more physical side of our
lives. There is also evidence that awareness and consciousness can be
independent from the body and this is coming from studies into physics
and the nature of energy in our universe.]{.class-0}

Purpose of this section

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
In this section we are more concerned with delineating the research into
energy than into consciousness. We are concerned with the research into
kundalini rather than with the awareness side of things. We must take it
for granted that awareness exists. Research into the energy side of yoga
shows us that there is a physically based energy in the body which also
has a psychic dimension. This fits the yogic description
[]{#part0055.xhtml_page_322} of prana, whose ultimate and maximum form
is that of kundalini.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Many times we have been amazed to hear the stories of yogis and saints
and have been awed by reading the ancient and universal teachings of
yoga, to realize that they are applicable even today. Often we have
wondered how yogis developed this science in the first place. Obviously
it has come from a profound and unusual experience, beyond the capacity
of the normal person to achieve or even understand without practising
yoga.]{.class-0}

[Swami Satyananda Saraswati is one of those who has reached
transcendental heights and come back to tell us about kundalini in
scientific terms. He has spoken about the kundalini phenomenon and has
laid down the fundamentals of kundalini yoga in a succinct, precise,
profound and yet easily understandable and systematic manner, as has
been done in this book. He has told us many things about the functions
of the body, for example, that the right nostril connects to the left
brain, and the left nostril to the right brain, which, in 1983, was
verified by researchers at the Salk Institute in America (see]{.class-0}
[[chapter 42]{.class-0}](#part0058.xhtml){.class5828-4} [). Through his
own internal experiences he has seen that most of us do not use our
potential and that within the brain there are unused areas of potential
energy, psychic awareness and total knowledge. It is actually possible
to experience the brain from inside. The source is within us, however,
we have not connected the various centres and circuits to the main
switches and the main generator. The way to do this, Swami Satyananda
tells us, is through kundalini yoga.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Often Swami Satyananda has referred to the works of researchers as a
means of validating and expressing the kundalini experience in easily
understandable scientific terms, and to show that there are many people
working on this most important aspect of life. Much of their research is
outlined here in simple terms. This research represents pioneering
efforts to delineate the broader function of man. No doubt, in the
future, new machines and methods will have]{.class-0}

is 'bad', for it creates anxiety and depression and has precipitated a
plague of psychosomatic disease and suffering unparalleled in former

psychic energy may have its origin in electrical activity, but the
nature of the energy is entirely different. However, yogis state that

Modern science has been able to ascertain that psychic energy is a real
and physically-based phenomenon. Though it does not fall into the known
categories of modern science, its effects can be experienced and
recorded repeatedly. No one really doubts its existence. What it is and
how it functions, its relationship to our body and mind and its
potential use as an evolutionary tool require further research from
scientists who will find guidelines in the perspectives and experiences
of dedicated yogis.
:::

[Through this, we will be better able to understand the relationship of
mind and body and this will have tremendous repercussions on studies
into psychosomatic medicine, psychology and other important fields. As
we ourselves learn to appreciate that great joy and good health which
comes from developing and being sensitive to psychic energy, a large and
forgotten area of our being, we will extend our possibilities, develop
our innate potential and speed up our spiritual evolution.]{.class-0}

having distinct channels, light, colour, sound and other
characteristics. At the same time, however, these nadis underlie, and
can be seen mirrored in, all bodily functions and processes. There is no

The duality of life

In many of the oriental philosophies, the entire universe is seen as a
separation into two great, polarized forces, Shiva and Shakti, which are
interdependent and opposite, but complementary. The universe hangs as a
kind of web of interacting energies, suspended and functioning within
the framework of tensions developed by the fundamental polarity. Carl
Jung stated, "natural processes are phenomena of energy constantly
arising out of a 'less probable'
state."[]{#part0057.xhtml_k-4pqyFpS4aI3ekXWdsL9A5971}
[1](#part0068.xhtml_k-4pqyFpS4aI3ekXWdsL9A5998){.class5834-1} This
apparent dualism is actually a unified, holistic process from another
level of consciousness, but at our own level we see it from a
fragmented, limited and partial perspective.
:::

[We see polarity everywhere we look, in nature, within ourselves and
within our mind. Moving from macrocosmic to microcosmic to atomic, at
every level, two great principles or forces can be seen at work

female. All other forces are seen to be an outcome of these two main
forces. It seems amazing to us that things can be so simple and yet so
profound; however, to the enlightened mind, the universe and man is just
so.]{.class-0}

[All of life, therefore, has two main aspects upon which all of our

two main forms or modes of energy interacting and creating endless
manifestations in the universe of our body. For example, we have a right

relationship. They said that man has three main flows of energy, which
they called the nadis, ida, pingala and sushumna, and which have been
roughly translated as mind, body, and spirit. The third flow is the
result of the balanced interaction of the first two. They also said that
man functions mainly in the first two areas of body and mind, pingala
and ida, the third aspect being dormant until it is stimulated by yoga

coin. Yogis did not describe the nadis in terms of structures, though

positive, dynamic mental side within Freud's system is Eros, the

[Ida is the energy within the personality which is passive, receptive,

energy dissipating, disorganizing, entropic, expansive (centrifugal) and
relaxing. At the mental plane Freud called it Thanatos, the death
instinct, and Jung called it anima, the unconscious female within,
emotional, feeling, intuitive and non-discriminating, the background on
which the differences can be seen and which unifies. This is the
somopsychic aspect of man, where energy is inwardly directed, and the
body acts on the mind. Ida controls the sense organs or jnanendriyas

Another force exists in nature which is little understood or even

two opposing forces are equal and balanced, a third force arises. Strike
a match on a matchbox and you create fire, bring positive and negative
currents together and you can work machinery, unite body and mind and a
third force called sushumna, spiritual energy, arises. This is one of
the aims of yoga, because only when sushumna awakens can the super power
of kundalini, this maximum force, ascend safely to fuel, power and
create cosmic consciousness. Sushumna is a high tension power line, and
ida and pingala carry the domestic lines to power the basic necessities.

Nadis are flows of energy which move through each and every part of our
body, the subtle counterpart of the physical flows such as nervous
energy and blood. All of the thousands of nadis in the body are based on
ida and pingala which spiral around the spinal cord. These are the basic
two modes of function on which all of our bodily and mental processes
work. Sushumna is the royal road which takes us to higher awareness and
transforms the function of ida and pingala.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Each and every cell of our body, every organ, the brain and mind,
everything is polarized and interconnected at both the physical and
subtle levels, and this allows us to think, speak and act in a
concerted, balanced, synchronous manner, every part working to help
every other part. There are two basic systems in the body that control
this, ida and pingala, and if we stimulate any component of one system
we turn on the whole system. This is how asana, pranayama, meditation,

which active and passive are fully balanced. Someone in this state is
simultaneously externally and internally focused. For example, we should

under conditions of extreme stress and in emergencies, people have sent

kundalini works are based on the brain, and this research can help us to
better understand the basis for kundalini awakening, the nadis and

control systems for the body within its unlimited circuitry, must
contain the physical circuits for the nadis and chakras.]{.class-0}

[The brain is also the interface between the body and the mind. All
sensory information travels to the brain via the jnanendriyas, the sense
organs of knowledge, and is then fed into the mind, and all decisions in
the mind are then translated into the body via the karmendriyas, the
organs of action, in a continuous, synchronous, dynamic process. Thus
within the workings of the brain we can see the workings of the nadis as
described by yogis, and research is deepening our understanding of this.
Yogic techniques utilize this knowledge to stimulate the body so as to
achieve higher and better states of being.]{.class-0}

circuits via the various yogic techniques, we can totally transform our
mind/body complex. The basis for yogic techniques lies in the fact that
there is a nadi/chakra system which can be seen, at the physical level,
as being the sum total of the input and output of the various sections
of the nervous system and the parts of the body which connect to it.
This total body/mind complex functions on the power
[]{#part0058.xhtml_page_341} of the three basic types of energy -- ida,

Scientific study of the hemispheres of the brain by Sperry, Myers,

of the brain is usually concerned with speech, logic, analysis, time and
linear function, whereas the right side is silent, dark, intuitive,
feeling, spatial, holistic in function, and does not require linear,
structured analysis for its knowledge, though how it does know is a
mystery. The right side of the brain is the physical side of ida nadi,

Zen with neurological discoveries, sums up the situation when he states,

throws light on brain functioning which points to the fact that the
brain has two main modes of emotional
activity.[]{#part0058.xhtml_k-4pqyFpS4aI3ekXWdsL9A6010}

[Research indicates that the left hemisphere governs happiness and
positive feelings and the right brain governs sadness and negative
feelings. In the abnormal situation, patients with right brain damage
are often cheerful, elated and indifferent to their abnormal state. Left
brain damage, on the other hand, can lead to a gloomy outlook on life
and unjustified anger, guilt and despair. Most of us fluctuate from one
state to another even in the normal situation, though not to the
extremes found in brain damaged subjects. Still the experience of
fluctuation can be distressing if we are not balanced and
healthy.]{.class-0}

[The fact the left brain is associated with bright, cheerful thoughts
and the right with sad and depressing thoughts, Kinsbourne theorizes,
points to the conclusion that this dual action of the brain is designed
to handle our likes (pingala) and dislikes (ida). The things we like are
handled by the left brain, which focuses on and then approaches the
object or situation. This fits in with our active mode, the concept of
the externally directed pingala nadi. We try to avoid or withdraw from
the things we dislike and we tend to be much more concerned with the
overall picture in this situation. This is handled by the right brain
and fits in with our receptive mode, introversion and ida nadi
concept.]{.class-0}

The brain has two major modes or systems which must work together and be
harmonized if we are not to lose the essentials of our human existence.
The nadis must be balanced for optimal functioning, for sushumna to
function, and for us to maximize our human elements and potential.
Unfortunately, few of us are really balanced and most of us, especially
men, tend towards the purely external, materialistic and technological
pingala side rather than the subtle, intuitive, feeling ida side. When
imbalance between the nadis is minor we may not even notice its effect,
though it must manifest in our personality, behaviour, relationships and
so forth, in ways that are baffling to us, and which can make our lives
miserable. What happens in the normal situation can be better understood
when we look at an extreme example.

These people also tell jokes at the wrong moment, their sentences become

in their sentences are lost and are submerged or flattened, becoming

replaced the several hundred year old paradigm of Newton. Einstein
stated, "The real thing is intuition. A thought comes and I may try to
express it in words afterwards." Yogis would say that Einstein had not

[There are three main nadis: ida, pingala and sushumna, and there are
said to be thousands and thousands of nadis spread throughout the whole
body. Though these nadis are body-based they are not physical structures
but rather appear to be functional. They are dynamic, alive, moving,
powering the body and mind, intimately linked with nerves, blood vessels
and all our body organs. While there is no known physical structural
support system for them, yogis maintain that they definitely do exist
and have even mapped their pathways in the body and their effects on the

working consistently to prove the existence of nadis and acupuncture
meridians, as well as the chakras. He is a graduate from the Tokyo
University of Education with PhD degrees in philosophy and clinical
psychology, and was recognized by UNESCO in 1974 as one of the world's
ten foremost []{#part0059.xhtml_page_351} parapsychologists. He has even
invented his own equipment in order to elucidate the science of yoga and
to make this knowledge scientifically clear and acceptable. He states:
:::

["By studying a number of books about the nadis and chakras of yoga over
the last two years, I have been able to establish that asana, mudra,
pranayama and dharana were ingeniously evolved on the basis of knowledge
of the nadi system."]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Motoyama states that acupuncture and the yogic concept of nadis have
the same foundation and have affected each other for over 2000 years.
That is, we are dealing with systems that have been in operation for
millennia. This in itself is reason to believe that there must be
something firm and solid at their foundations for people to have
accepted and followed their theories for so long. Systems which do not
give results are usually quickly discarded.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[As an example of the correspondence of acupuncture and yoga, Motoyama
points out that the concept of the]{.class-0} [triple heater
meridian]{.class5827-1} [in acupuncture and the five pranas of the body
in yogic physiology are almost identical. In acupuncture the lower
heater, the area below the navel, corresponds to apana, the middle
heater corresponds to samana between the diaphragm and navel and the
upper heater corresponds to the prana between the throat and the
diaphragm.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Yoga also states that chakras act as transducers, converting psychic
energy into physical energy and vice versa. They distribute this energy
to the body via nadis. Several acupuncture meridians lie in the areas
attributed to the chakras and nadis, for example, the]{.class-0}
[governor vessel]{.class5827-1} [in the spine corresponds with sushumna
nadi and the]{.class-0} [conception vessel]{.class5827-1} [running along

Proof of nadis
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
One of the machines Motoyama has developed in order to prove the
existence of nadis and meridians is the AMI, or 'Apparatus for Measuring
the Functional Conditions of []{#part0059.xhtml_page_352} Meridians and
their Corresponding Internal Organs'. This is an instrument designed to
measure electrical currents in the body. It measures the steady state
current that exists all the time, as well as the current in the body in
response to an electrical shock from DC voltage. He uses it to measure
the charge at special acupuncture points alongside the base of the
fingernails and toenails. These are called [sei]{.class5827-0} (spring,
well) points and are said to be the terminals for meridians, where
psychic energy either enters or exits from the body.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In an experiment designed to substantiate the existence of acupuncture
meridians and nadis, Motoyama placed electrodes on seven acupuncture
points lying along the left]{.class-0} [triple heater
meridian]{.class5827-1} [which runs along the back of the left arm and
the front of the body, as well as a random electrode on the right palm,
a point far from the area to be electrically stimulated. He then gave
the subject a painful 20 volt shock to the 'sei' or beginning point of
the]{.class-0} [triple heater]{.class5827-1} [meridian]{.class5827-1} [,
at the tip of the fourth fingernail. A few milliseconds later he
recorded an overall and equal physical reaction in all electrodes caused
by excitation of the sympathetic nervous system in response to
pain.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[To prove that nadis do exist he then gave a very mild, painless and
sensationless shock to the same point and two to three seconds later
recorded an electrical response only in those specific points said,
since ancient times, to be connected to the]{.class-0} [triple heater
meridian]{.class5827-1} [. No response was recorded on the palm
electrode or in any other part of the body. It is an interesting fact
that the greatest response was found in the electrode at the other end
of the meridian, just below the navel. No physiological or neurological
connection is known to explain the phenomenon, however, the yogic and
acupuncture explanations are validated by this experiment.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[It is very important to realize that the effect of stimulating the
meridian electrically is not a neurological process because the movement
of energy in the nadi and meridian is much slower than we find in
nerves. The energy we are dealing with is something else, some other
form that]{.class-0} []{#part0059.xhtml_page_353 .class-0} [we have as
yet not understood. This fact is substantiated by the work of Dr
Nagahama at the Chiba University Medical School in Japan, who showed
that the time it took for the sensation to pass along the meridian was
hundreds of times slower (15 to 48 centimetres per second) than nerve
conduction (5 to 80 metres per second). Therefore, we have to postulate
the existence of some other channel of transmission and nadis fit this
description exactly.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In another experiment, Motoyama coated a subject's arm with a paint
consisting of liquid crystals which react to changes in temperature by
changing colour. When the 'sei' point of an acupuncture meridian was
stimulated by heat for from two to five minutes, the liquid crystals in
certain subjects changed colour in a band along the meridian being
stimulated. This not only further supports the above research but also
substantiates another claim of yoga, that one of the characteristics of
prana is generating heat in the body.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Motoyama has been able to visually demonstrate and measure subtle
changes in the body that point to the fact that there is a flow of some
kind of energy in the body which does not fit in with our present day
knowledge of body mechanisms, such as in neurophysiology, yet which has
a physical counterpart that laboratories can record. The exact nature of
this flow of energy, the connections between the subtle and gross
physical structures and the method by which prana acts on the body await
further clarification.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[What we do know is that we are dealing with a new phenomenon, and a
very important one which has tremendous relevance to our present day
needs in terms of understanding the body and mind and the relationship
between energy and consciousness.]{.class-0}
:::

The nadis and disease
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Motoyama's experiments have also shown that the energy he is measuring
is not just a peripheral phenomenon, some by-product of electrical and
chemical processes, but of primary importance to our health. He has
developed a system by []{#part0059.xhtml_page_354} which we can use our
measurements of the electrical state of the nadi system to know about
our body's state of health and even of each individual organ.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The AMI is supersensitive, able to record minute changes in activity.
It measures three different states of the nadi system. The first is the
baseline reading or steady state value, that which exists in our body
all the time. This tells us about our general long term constitution.
Secondly, it measures the body's reaction to a very mild and
sensationless electrical stimulation, which tells us how we react to
events. And thirdly, it records the after-effects of the stimulus, which
gives information on the temporary functions of the body and basic
tissue resistance.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Thousands of such readings have been recorded and it has been found
that most of us fit into a 'normal' range of values. If the value
recorded is more than normal, the meridian is overactive relative to
most people, while a low value indicates an underactive nadi. For
example, one man whom Motoyama studied at Stanford University in America
had lung cancer. Instead of the normal value of 1,000, this man had a
value of only 150, showing great depletion of energy in that area, and
indeed, he was very sick. A number of hospitals in Japan are using
Motoyama's AMI machine to screen patients and the Kanagawa
Rehabilitation Centre in Japan is comparing the results of X-ray and
biochemistry with it. So far the results have been very
favourable.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Motoyama has worked out that by measuring values of electrical skin
resistance at acupuncture points in response to a small electric
stimulus on both sides of the body, and then comparing the values from
the left and right sides, any imbalance in the readings indicates that
disease is present in the organ linked to the meridian being measured.
He found that any percentage difference greater than 1.21 indicated
disease. For example, when the heart meridian value on the left was more
that 1.21 times greater than the right, the EGG might show an abnormal
rhythm. One patient who was found to have imbalance in the liver, gall
bladder and stomach]{.class-0} []{#part0059.xhtml_page_355 .class-0}
[meridians, but who only had symptoms of stomach upset was found on
X-ray to have gallstones. One of Motoyama's laboratory assistants showed
a large difference between the left and right bladder and kidney values
shortly before being diagnosed as having cystitis.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[It is interesting to note that yogis are also found to have abnormally
high readings, but without disease, and Motoyama states that this
indicates a greater range of activity of the nervous system as a result
of yogic techniques.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[These findings are very important because they indicate that pranic
energy, or]{.class-0} [ki]{.class5827-1} [, which yogis have experienced
as flowing in the nadis, is real. Yogis state that an imbalance in the
nadis, especially ida and pingala, will cause disease and that yogic
techniques can rectify this situation by acting on the nadis. Motoyama's
work substantiates this. It points to the fact that not only is prana
real, physical and measurable, but that its balanced activity is vital
to our health and that we can use our measurements of pranic activity in
the various organs of the body to diagnose impending or existing disease
and thereby either prevent or treat the condition before it becomes too
far advanced.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Such research is paving the way for new diagnostic techniques in
medicine. We are beginning to absorb the subtler aspects of our
existence into our modern scientific understanding of the body and are
utilizing this knowledge in our armamentum against disease to better our
lives and to uplift society.]{.class-0}
:::

Imbalance in the nadis
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Motoyama's research supports the claim by yogis that within our body are
flows of energy with physical and psychic properties. Yogis also tell us
that the nadis are intrinsically related to the flows of breath in the
nostrils. The breath in the right nostril is related to the function of
pingala (left brain), and in the left nostril is related to the function
of ida (right brain). This fact is the basis for swara yoga, the science
by which we can know about the state of our body and mind
[]{#part0059.xhtml_page_356} in relation to the outer environment by
watching the flow of breath in the nostrils.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The fact that the nadis are related to the nostrils is the basis for
the science of pranayama, one of the most important and basic
ingredients in kundalini yoga. For it is by manipulating the flows of
breath that we can learn to control the deeper and more subtle aspects
of our body and mind, to release energy and to send it to areas of the
body that we wish to energize, heal and awaken. This relationship
between the flow of breath and the nostrils has been demonstrated by
research from Rumania.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Dr I.N. Riga, an ear, nose and throat specialist from Bucharest,

[He found that 89 percent of cases breathed more through the left
nostril and were more prone to certain types of respiratory diseases
such as chronic sinusitis, middle and inner ear infections, partial or
total loss of the senses of smell, hearing and taste, recurrent
pharyngitis, laryngitis and tonsillitis, and chronic
bronchitis.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[He also found these left nostril (ida) breathers were more likely to
suffer from one or more of a wide variety of more distant disorders,
such as amnesia, intellectual weakening, headaches, hyperthyroidism,
heart failure, gastritis, colitis, peptic ulcer, poor liver function,
constipation and reproductive problems, such as a decreased libido and
menstrual irregularities.]{.class-0}

[Patients whose breath flowed predominantly through the right nostril
were predisposed to hypertension. Riga found that correction of nasal
deformities helped to relieve the disease situation.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Riga's research supports the yogic theory of nadis and indicates that
the nostrils and the flow of breath in them are much more important than
we previously realized, having many neurological and psychic connections
whose function is not known. It supports Motoyama's work which shows
that imbalance in the nadis is related to disease states and
points]{.class-0} []{#part0059.xhtml_page_357 .class-0} [to the fact
that the nostrils are, as yogis have said, windows into the state of our
body and mind, a fact which medical science can use in diagnosing many
disease situations.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[More than this, the nostrils and the science of pranayama allow us to
influence the body and mind by influencing the nervous system and
psychic energy at the more subtle levels of our being. The nostrils are
switches which can do more than merely alleviate disease. By controlling
the speed, rate, rhythm, length and duration of the breath, by altering
the ratio of inhalation to exhalation in the nostrils and by stopping
the breath, we can activate or tone down neurological and mental
processes so as to achieve heightened awareness and altered states of
consciousness.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class202 lang="en-us"}
[Yoga is a science of self-regulation which is a priceless gem in
today's disease and worry-ridden world. It bestows knowledge about
internal flows of energy and thereby mastery over the inner processes of
our being and autonomy, independence and confidence in our ability to
deal with the constant demands and pressures of modern living. In the
long run, regular, sincere practice and proper guidance by a competent
master balances the nadis and eventually awakens kundalini.]{.class-0}

[T]{.class220-kfx-dropcap} he chakras can be interpreted from many
points of view, for example, physical, psychological, behavioural,
psychic, symbolic, mythical, religious, scientific, evolutionary,
spiritual and more. They have both a microcosmic aspect within the human
framework and, at the same time, a macrocosmic aspect which totally
encompasses our perception and experience of life. At whatever level we
examine them, they represent a hierarchical, interlocking and
interdependent series of mandalas which, when superimposed on one
another, make up a total picture of the human personality.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Each of us stands at a certain point of evolution that ascends the
chakras and this will determine how we see the world. Someone who lives
at swadhisthana sees the world in terms of gratification of his desires,
for example, at manipura in terms of gratification of power instincts,
at anahata in terms of compassion and love for all humanity. The degree
of evolution of the chakras depends to a great extent on the activity
within our nervous system and our state of consciousness. Someone at a
lower level cannot understand someone at a higher level whereas the
person at a higher level has been at the lower level before, has a wider
range of experience, and importantly, has more circuits awakened or
activated for handling life's experiences, for perceiving at different
levels, and for interpreting and acting on the demands of
life.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {#part0060.xhtml_page_359 .class179 lang="en-us"}
[Even within the same chakra there are different levels of evolution,
balance and activity, so that someone living at manipura might be more
aware than someone else at manipura, their centre being more balanced
and awakened, so that, for example, they use their power drives in a
constructive and positive manner to help people, rather than in a
destructive and negative way for their own personal ego gratification.
An adult generally has a more evolved manipura chakra than a child,
protecting the child from danger while the child pulls the wings off
butterflies or gaily stamps on ants and insects. Of course, this is
relative and varies from individual to individual.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Each level in the chakra system is the sum total of various physical,
emotional, mental, psychic and spiritual elements. Each chakra has its
own neurological plexus and endocrine gland and these link up to various
organs and systems in the body. These organs and systems in turn are
connected to the controlling mechanisms of the brain, each of which has
emotional, mental and psychic components. The chakra is like a
transducer, a linking point between the various levels of our being and
it converts and channels energy either up or down to the various
levels.]{.class-0}

[Therefore, we can think of each level in the spinal cord as controlling
a different segment of the body, and at the same time, representing a
level of functioning in the nervous system and mind. Ajna, for example,
is a much more complex centre than mooladhara, or any chakra for that
matter, controlling as it does the intuitive and higher mental faculties
related to the most evolved circuits in the cerebral cortex. Ajna has as
its symbol the two-petalled lotus, and we can think of this as
representing the two hemispheres of the brain with the pineal gland as
its central point. Mooladhara, on the other hand, controls very deep,
powerful, primitive, animalistic, unconscious urges and instincts which
are related to very simple and primitive neurological circuits at the
bottom of the brain common to all animals, reptiles and even
birds.]{.class-0}

trying to understand the mind with the mind, or grasp the hand with the

back then they also based their techniques on the discovery that there
are six major primary centres in the body, the chakras, in a
hierarchical, interconnected network within the spinal cord. They also
observed that each of these chakras had its own definite physical,
psychological and behavioural characteristics, connected to the brain by
a network of energy flows, all of which did not necessarily correspond
to purely physical structures. They also discovered many secondary
centres which were subsidiary to these primary ones.]{.class-0}

three main areas, three interconnected biological computers, each with

memory, motor and other
functions.[]{#part0060.xhtml_k-4pqyFpS4aI3ekXWdsL9A5921}

corresponds to a separate evolutionary step and is also distinguished
neuro-anatomically and functionally, containing strikingly different
distributions of the main neurochemicals in the brain, which are
dopamine and serotonin. If we look carefully into these levels and
compare descriptions of neuroscientists and yogis we see that both were
saying the same thing. (See figures 1 and 2)

[1. The reptilian complex]{.class5824-2} [includes the very topmost
spinal cord and the lower areas of the brain, including the medulla
oblongata and part of the reticular activating system, that part
responsible for our waking, conscious state. This area contains the
basic neural machinery for self-preservation and reproduction, including
regulation of the heart, blood circulation and respiration. It controls
mating, social hierarchies, insistence on routine, obedience to
precedent and ritual, and slavish imitation of fads and
fashions.]{.class-0}

[According to MacLean, the R-complex plays an important role in
aggressive behaviour, territoriality, ritual and the establishment of
social hierarchies. This area corresponds to the description of the
mooladhara and swadhisthana chakras, because yogis have told us these
centres maintain our most basic and primitive, animalistic drives and
instincts; basic living, eating, sleeping and procreating within a dark
and primitive, monotonous and repetitious existence, minus joy, love and
self-awareness. They are related to our deepest unconscious and
subconscious mind.]{.class-0}

the formulation of laws and economic and political systems, for
motivating the development of the arts and sciences, religions and

Ajna chakra

All of these intellectual, intuitive, creative and expressive functions
are said by yogis to be characteristic of ajna and
[]{#part0060.xhtml_page_367} vishuddhi chakras. We know that yogic
techniques are especially aiming at stimulation of ajna chakra, which
lies at the pineal gland, midway between the hemispheres.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Yogis state that ajna chakra and the pineal gland as its physical
centre, is the master control chakra, the guru chakra. We know from
physiology that just in front of the pineal gland lies the thalamus, at
the top of the limbic system. The thalamus has been found to be one of
the main centres regulating the interaction of our senses and motor
activity (ida and pingala), the prefrontal cortex, which includes the
right and left sides of the brain (ida and pingala), the hypothalamus,
which integrates and expresses emotion and regulates the ANS and the
endocrine glands, and the cerebellum, which helps to control movement.
It therefore integrates senses, thought, emotion and action. It is also
important in the recognition of pain and other sensory modalities, such
as variations in the degree of temperature and touch, the size, shape
and quality of objects contacting the sense organs. Another interesting
fact is that it is involved in the control of movement and especially
the degree of squeezing and contracting of muscles and
joints.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[We see, therefore, that the pineal/thalamic area fits the description
for ajna chakra, the area where senses and emotion, both ida functions,
and motor and intellect, both pingala functions, meet. Yogis tell us
that fusion of ida and pingala at ajna is one of the definitions of
yoga. It leads to an explosion within the nervous system which somehow
fuels and activates a much larger number of circuits within both
hemispheres and the limbic system than would normally occur. It is as
though our nervous system suddenly becomes charged with a high tension
electric line, which yogis called sushumna.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Yogis also tell us that ajna is involved in intuition and perception of
the subtle and psychic. If the thalamic area handles degrees of
perception and motor activity, making it possible for us to experience

The chakras in perspective
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
Yogis tell us that the chakras lie along the spinal cord, that
mooladhara lies in the perineum and the other chakras move upward
towards sahasrara at the apex of man's evolution and consciousness. Ajna
chakra is the highest centre in which man feels that he exists separate
from the universe. Union or cosmic consciousness takes place in
sahasrara. Ajna is the controlling chakra, the guru centre where
commands are heard.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Neurophysiology points out that there are centres in the brain,
stretching upward from the medulla oblongata to the pineal/thalamic area
which correspond to the classical description of the chakras as told by
yogis. We can say that within the brain all these fall under the control
of ajna chakra, that there are layers of evolution within ajna, and as
each chakra awakens in the spine, it affects the level of conscious
awakening and activity in ajna. The pineal/thalamic area would represent
that part of the brain which is most awakened and fully activated by
total ajna chakra awakening, while the medulla oblongata area is that
part which corresponds to the mooladhara chakra area. This would explain
the close link between mooladhara and ajna; that the awakening of one
consequentially awakens the other.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In most people, ajna, the thalamic/pineal area, is dormant. Living
mostly in mooladhara and swadhisthana would mean that ajna functions
mainly from the medulla oblongata, the reptilian brain. When we
stimulate and awaken the centres through yoga, we jump levels in our
nervous system and consciously awaken the higher pineal/thalamic areas
and their concomitant levels of consciousness. When ida and pingala meet
in ajna, energy flows from mooladhara to ajna, from the medulla
oblongata to the pineal/thalamic area.]{.class-0}

pranayama, to name a few. When we say these techniques are stimulating
ajna chakra we are really stating that somehow they stimulate the
integrating and centrally located pineal/thalamic area and thereby
awaken our normally dormant, higher intellectual/emotional,
logical/intuitive functions. They stimulate the higher elements of ajna
and raise our consciousness up out of the lower, reptilian medulla
oblongata. The techniques balance the functioning of our total
brain/mind complex, ida and pingala, by focusing on the central,
stimulating area and set the stage for the awakening of
kundalini.]{.class-0}

autonomic nervous system and internal organs . . . through various

a telephone booth and enclosed in a light-proof, lead-shielded room, the
machine was designed to detect energy generated in the body and then
emitted from it in terms of various physical variables such as
electrical, magnetic and optical energy changes. Copper electrodes are

centimetres in front of the subject, level with the classical position
for a given chakra. The location is monitored for changes as the
individual concentrates his mental energy at the chakra point, and
measurements are made for three to five minutes before, during and after
concentration on the chakra. Because of its powerful pre-amplifier
(impedance near infinity), even the most subtle energy ejection can be
picked up and recorded. Information recorded is sent to various
amplifiers, computerized analyzers and oscilloscopes and is recorded on
a highly sensitive chart recorder. Other equipment is also used to
monitor respiration, the autonomic nervous system (galvanic skin
resistance), changes in blood flow (plethysmograph), heart

to measure other effects of chakra stimulation on the body and to make

by Rosalyn Bruyere, a psychic 'aura reader', Hunt used a number of
measurements in order to study the body's field emission when it is
being stimulated by deep muscle massage (Rolfing). This was prompted by
an earlier observation that after Rolfing and meditation there was an
increase in the electromyographic baseline.

measures the steady, low voltage of muscular activity plus several other
instruments. Electrodes were attached to eight sites, including chakra
locations such as the crown (sahasrara), eyebrow centre (ajna), throat
(vishuddhi), heart (anahata), base of the spine and acupuncture points
on the foot and knee. The sites for the electrodes were in places where
muscle activity was minimal and, therefore, electrical readings would
indicate energy from a different source. The electrodes were placed on
the body in consultation with the 'aura reader'.]{.class-0}

[The individual being experimented on was given Rolfing (deep muscle

therefore, theoretically able to effect chakra activity. As the massage
progressed the EMG readings were recorded on one track of a two-tracked
tape recorder. Simultaneously, while isolated in another room and
oblivious to the EMG and subject's reports, Bruyere recorded on the
second track her observations of psychic activity in terms]{.class-0}
[]{#part0061.xhtml_page_376 .class-0} [of colour change at the various
centres. Hunt was able to question the aura reader via a separate audio
system so that no clue as to what the subject was experiencing or what
was going on at the EMG level could be detected by the psychic. At the
same time the subject related his experience which was tape-recorded
using a second microphone, and any similarity between his experience,
the symptoms of chakra activation and the EMG recording were
noted.]{.class-0}

[It was quickly evident in the central monitoring room where Hunt was
sitting, that the EMG changes and the distinctive wave forms being

did the experience of the subject. Later analysis, whether by wave form,
Fourier-frequency analysis or sonogram, produced consistently the same
pattern of results.]{.class-0}

[Hunt acknowledged that the possible interpretations of this data are
staggering. The radiations were taken directly from the body surface,
quantitatively measured in a natural state and were isolated by
scientifically accepted data resolution procedures. The study concluded
that there had been direct correspondence in every instance throughout
all recordings between the distinctive wave form and the psychic's
description of the colour emanating from the chakra. For example, every
time a medium-large, sharp deflection with single or double peaks at the
top occurred, the psychic reported the colour blue, while red
corresponded to large, sharp clumps of regular and irregular spikes of
short duration interspersed with plateaux. Yellow was a broad, smooth
wave resembling an uneven sine wave.]{.class-0}

events into the more subtle.

miraculous, abnormal or supernormal about psychic phenomena. Most of us

that this faculty is not a myth and not confined just to yogis

The work of Motoyama and Hunt points to the fact that within the
physical body there are locations which, though they may not have any
obvious physical or structural demarcation, have definite functional
characteristics which differentiate them from other parts of the body.
It verifies the fact that the yogic descriptions of these points
correspond to physical emanations in the case of Motoyama's research and
psychic emanations in the case of Hunt's research.

locations, when activated, are related to emanations of light and

stored in the subconscious mind, beyond our usual conscious capacity.
When we concentrate and focus psychic energy, chitta shakti, on the

mind, and that they produce both physical and psychic energy which can
be measured and quantified. There is something within the body of man,

The physio-kundalini syndrome

One researcher who developed an ingenious method to measure bodily
change during meditation and the awakening of kundalini is Itzhak
Bentov. In his book [Stalking the Wild Pendulum]{.class5827-0} he has
set out an original and also very yogic understanding of consciousness
and matter, one which can very neatly explain kundalini from the point
of view of physics. He also discusses a model by which we can understand
the kundalini experience in physiological terms.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Bentov states that, "the human nervous system has a tremendous latent
capacity for evolution. This evolution can be accelerated by meditative
techniques, or it can occur spontaneously in an unsuspecting individual.
In both cases, a sequence of events is triggered, causing sometimes
strong and unusual bodily reactions and unusual psychological states.
Some of those people who meditate may suspect that these reactions are
somehow connected with meditation. Others, however, who develop these
symptoms spontaneously may panic and seek medical advice . . .
Unfortunately, however, western medicine is presently not equipped to
handle these problems. Strangely, in spite of the intensity of the
symptoms, little or no physical pathology can be found."]{.class-0}

a vast area of the human psyche which we are totally ignorant of, which
we do not experience consciously in our lives, and which we are,
therefore, helpless to deal with adequately if something goes wrong.
Bentov feels that symptoms do not occur in the healthy, relaxed state,
but only when energy reaches tensions in the body. This agrees with the
yogic view that we must prepare ourselves for awakening by a long period
of preparatory sadhana to avoid unpleasant results.]{.class-0}

As we start to practise meditation we initially experience its calming,
relaxing and stabilizing effects. Prolonged practice, and especially the
more vigorous forms of meditative practice, take us far beyond these
preliminary changes which many modern researchers have been stressing as
the main aim and effect of meditation. After some time, actual
psychophysiological changes take place and amongst these there is a
change in the mode of functioning of our nervous system.
:::

[In order to measure these psychophysiological changes Bentov used a
modified ballistocardiograph, a machine which measures small bodily

[Bentov states that the spinal cord can be thought of as a spring which,
during meditation, reacts to the movement of blood into the heart and
circulatory system. The heart pumps blood into the large blood vessel
called the aorta. The aorta is curved on top (at the level of the bottom
of the neck)]{.class-0} []{#part0062.xhtml_page_383 .class-0} [and
bifurcated at the bottom (in the lower abdomen). Every time blood enters
the aorta it moves upward towards the head and this gives a minute
upward push to the upper part of the body. The blood then moves downward
to strike the bifurcation of the aorta, gently pushing the body
downward. This movement is called micromotion and the movement recorded
on the ballistocardiograph is only in the order of 0.003 to 0.009
millimetres, a very minute amount.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[This gentle upward and downward movement has the tendency to oscillate
the whole body, spine and skull up and down. The natural rhythm of this
oscillation is 7 cycles/second (7 Hertz, Hz). Of course in the normal
situation we do not feel such minute micromotion, however, in the deep
stillness of profound meditation even the slightest and most subtle
movement of the body or thought creates ripples within the nervous
system which, to our introverted consciousness, become magnified and
disturb inward progress.]{.class-0}

[Yogis have always stressed that the most important preliminary
ingredient for meditation is to develop a straight and strong spinal
cord through asana and to gradually develop stillness of the body,
nervous system and mind through pranayama. Through Bentov's model we can
now see that this is because immobility of body, breath and mind sets
the stage for the production of rhythmic waves within the spine, skull

our waking, dreaming or sleeping lives. At the same time we enter a

The oscillating circuits
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
The up and down movement of the body produced by the heart during
meditation affects the brain which is floating in its protective bony
and fluid casing, the cranium and CSF. According to Bentov, this
micromotion up and down sets up acoustical and possible electrical plane
waves reverberating in the skull. Mechanical stimulation may be
converted into electrical vibrations.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The acoustical plane waves are focused within the third and lateral
ventricles, small cave-like, CSF filled structures deep within the
brain. The plane waves activate and drive standing waves into the
ventricles. While the body stays in meditation, the frequency of waves
within the ventricles of the brain will remain locked to the heart/aorta
pulsation. Bentov felt that these vibrations within the brain are
responsible for the sounds yogis hear in meditation. This aspect of
meditation is called nada yoga, listening to and following the inner
sounds, and is said to herald the coming of kundalini.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class185 lang="en-us"}
The loop circuit
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
According to Bentov the standing waves in the ventricles are within the
audio and superauditory ranges. They stimulate the cerebral cortex
mechanically, eventually resulting in a stimulus travelling in a closed
loop around each hemisphere. The lateral ventricle lies just under the
corpus callosum, the part of the brain connecting the two cerebral
hemispheres. The roof of the lateral ventricle acts as the taut skin on
a drum which moves rapidly up and down and thereby produces mechanical
waves in the ventricles which stimulate the sensory cortex lying just
above the corpus callosum.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[We can understand the effect of this stimulation by looking at the
diagram of the cross section of the brain (see figure 3). Waves would
commence at number 1 and travel]{.class-0} []{#part0062.xhtml_page_385

circuit. As the current returns to the starting point it stimulates the
pleasure centres in the various areas of the brain which surround the
lateral ventricle, such as in the cingulate gyrus, lateral hypothalamus,
hippocampus and amygdala areas, all part of the limbic system, and this
may give rise to the bliss and ecstasy reported by meditators whose
shakti awakens. The sensory current travels around the cortex at about 7
cycles per second.]{.class-0}

Bentov theorizes that stimulation of the corpus callosum will in turn
stimulate the sensory cortex to produce the sensations of something
moving in the body from the feet, up the spine, up over the head and
then down the abdomen and pelvis. It is this experience which many
people associate with the awakening of kundalini.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The experience of movement in the spine and body has been reported in
many cases of the awakening of shakti or energy within the nervous and
nadi systems. From areas as far apart as India, China, Africa and
America, the symptoms are often similar if not the same. Energy is felt
to rise upward and these sensations must be handled in progressive
sequence in the sensory cortex. We can also theorize that if we sit in
padmasana (lotus pose) or siddhasana/siddha yoni asana (accomplished
pose for men and women) that we may short-circuit the sensations in the
legs so that we subjectively experience the movement as commencing in or
near mooladhara.]{.class-0}

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
As a result of the circular currents in the brain, Bentov states that a
pulsating magnetic field is produced in each hemisphere of the order of
10-[9]{.class5834-1} gauss. On the right side of the brain the field is
from front to back, north to south, and on the left side, south to
north. This would correspond to ida and pingala at this level of body
energy. Bentov feels that the interaction of these waves with the
environment may be responsible for the psychic experiences which are
often felt as a by-product of systematic and deep yogic sadhana. He
states his findings as follows: "This magnetic field -- radiated by the
head acting as an antenna -- interacts with the electric and magnetic
fields already in the environment. We may consider the head as
simultaneously a transmitting and receiving antenna, tuned to a
particular one of the several resonant frequencies of the brain.
Environmental fields may thus be fed back to the brain, thus modulating
that resonant frequency. The brain will interpret this modulation as
useful information".[]{#part0062.xhtml_k-4pqyFpS4aI3ekXWdsL9A5890}

predominant frequency of about 7.5 cycles per second, and this is called
the Schumann resonance. Another interesting point is that the brain wave
frequency of 7 cycles/second is the region between alpha waves and theta
waves. This is the borderline between waking and sleeping, where we are
most relaxed, and if we can stay awake in meditation, it sets the brain
up for creativity and intuition. It is the time we are most psychically

We know that a log on a low flame is likely to blaze up suddenly on its
own, even after the original fire goes out. A threshold point is reached
and internal reactions take over spontaneously. The same mechanisms are
thought to occur in the nervous system to lead up to a series of events
analogous to the kindling of wood. Scientists are using this model to

[According to Bentov, the loop circuit in the sensory cortex set up by
sitting immobile in meditation may stimulate the pleasure centres in the
amygdala, the part of the brain most amenable to kindling. This would,
over a period of time, lead to permanent changes within the nervous
system in an ongoing and progressive manner. This is the aim of
meditation and all masters of yoga and the inner arts and sciences tell
us that for success, the most important ingredient is regularity of
practise and persistence. Whether our experiences in meditation are good
or bad is of no consequence. They are all just steps on the way to
higher experience, part of the process of preparation for kundalini
awakening.]{.class-0}

it induces relatively permanent changes and the second is that it
increases activity in the brain. It steps up the energy processes. This
fits in with the theory that meditation can energize the nadis so as to
send energy to various centres to awaken higher functions within those
centres in order to take them to a higher octave of activity by
supplying them with a better energy source.]{.class-0}

Meditation and the brain
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
When studying kundalini we must remember that there are as many methods
to awaken it as there are people practising, in fact there may be more
methods than people. The four basic methods studied by modern research
are raja yoga, kriya yoga, zazen and transcendental meditation.
Basically these techniques involve one or more of the following:
sitting, breath awareness, and mantra. Yogis normally divide meditation
into either the relaxation type or concentration type of practice.
However, we also know that whichever technique we choose we will have to
first develop relaxation and then allow the internal process to unfold.

Though it may be difficult, if not impossible, to record the actual
kundalini experience in the laboratory (either because such advanced
meditators do not usually talk about their own experiences, or because
the laboratory setting and environment is not correct, or because our
machinery might interfere with or explode under the force of the actual
experience), the research findings do tend to support Bentov's and the
kindling model for kundalini.
:::

[In the studies of meditation in which activation of the nervous system
was found, there was generalized coherence and integration of the brain
and/or blissful, ecstatic experiences. The experiences of awakening of
shakti recorded within the laboratory setting and their physiological
correlates agree with the yogic theory that awakening takes place in
mooladhara chakra and travels up to ajna chakra, affecting the deep,
primitive, animalistic and energizing circuits within the R-complex and
limbic system of the brain, near the medulla oblongata. Energy flows
from here to the thalamus to stimulate all the areas of the cerebral
cortex simultaneously and thereby creates a loop circuit which gradually
awakens latent and unused activity within other areas of the brain. The
whole brain begins to pulse as a single unit as energy pours into the
central controlling area of ajna chakra.]{.class-0}

[We can understand that as we progress in meditation, we set the stage

Kundalini induces an altered state of consciousness (ASC), that is, it
takes us to realms of inner experience beyond those normally accessible.

lies a relatively uncharted realm of mental activity, the nature and
function of which have been neither systematically explored or
adequately
conceptualized."[]{#part0063.xhtml_k-4pqyFpS4aI3ekXWdsL9A5953}

hypnosis, sensory deprivation, psychosis, hysterical states of
dissociation and depersonalization, pharmacologically induced mental
aberrations, sleeplessness, fasting and meditation as examples of ASCs.
Anything can induce an ASC, any place or event can trigger a change in
consciousness, however, usually we have to manoeuvre ourselves or use
some agent to bypass the so-called 'normal' functioning of the brain. We
can say that our normal state of consciousness is the one in which we
spend most of our waking lives.]{.class-0}

[There are many people, however, who believe that the state of

neurosis and disease. In terms of our inner experiences we are like
retarded dwarfs, like the flea kept under a glass who, after hitting its
head on the glass a number of times, ceases to jump hundreds of times
its own height but rather, even when the glass is removed, continues to
hop at a reduced capacity far below its innate potential. Yogis claim
that we are like the flea, pathetic shadows of our former selves and far

something is missing and this knowledge nags at us. We want to get away

The above are classical kundalini type experiences, but they have
occurred in different geographical locations and at different times in
history, because kundalini is not dependent on time and space. However,
few cultures have documented the kundalini experience so well or
consistently as the sages in India. The Indian culture seems to have
been ripe to allow the yogic sciences to be preserved, cultivated and
revered. As a result, a sublime philosophy has emerged and has been
recorded in many books, a few of which have come down to us through the
ravages of time and history. Books such as the [Bhagavad
Gita]{.class5827-0} , the yogic texts such as [Yoga
Vashishta]{.class5827-0} and [Hatha Yoga Pradipika]{.class5827-0} , and
the sublime beauty of the books of the Upanishads and Vedanta, which
have inspired many of the great men and women of history from all over
the world, are testaments to the existence of this great culture.
Sophisticated maps of consciousness, charts to allow us to enter the
sublime bliss of altered states of consciousness and meditative
experience, myriad techniques and processes, and untold works and books
for guidance have emerged and have been handed down over thousands of
years. Nowhere else has the kundalini experience been so well, richly or
scientifically recorded in all its sublimity and variation.

reaction of sense perception. Wherever there was any manifestation of
what is ordinarily called supernatural power or wisdom, a little current

[Consider manipura chakra. It deals with hunger and it is directly
connected with hunger centres in the hypothalamus. It is closely related
to the next chakra down, swadhisthana, which deals with pleasure. The
hunger and pleasure centres are adjacent in the posterior part of the
hypothalamus. They are so close to each other that some of the cells
actually intertwine and it is hard to separate which is which. It is
interesting to note that when people are sexually tense and sexually
dissatisfied, they start reaching for sweet things -- they get hungry,
start putting on weight and all that. This indicates the close
interconnection of these two chakras.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[There are also what we can call energy circuits involved in these
interconnections. These energies can be directed up or down. If the
instincts or desires related to specific areas are not actually
satisfied, then there is a tendency for the energy to build up. We see
it especially in relation to the sexual impulse, which is connected
mainly to swadhisthana, and also partly to mooladhara and manipura. An
unfulfilled sexual life at swadhisthana level tends to redirect energy
either into the desire for power and dominance at manipura or the
neurotic craving for possessions at mooladhara.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Energy is built into this chakra system and all of its connections with
the hypothalamus and the limbic system. The limbic system, amongst other
things, generates a continuity of emotions, and emotions of course
motivate action. If there is, for example, competition, then anger is
stirred up within the solar plexus, stomach areas and related organs,
including the adrenal glands. The adrenals, of course, activate a person
to fight if it is over territory or food. Also, adrenaline increases the
sugar content in the blood by breaking down glycogen in the liver, so it
keeps the animal going even though it is hungry and short of food. If
necessary, adrenaline will supply the bloodstream with sugar, so it can
win the fight and get food.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[It seems to me that a lot of the physiological energy that is inherent
in all these chakra circuits is this sort of energy. I do not really
believe it is energy per se, but I think it is]{.class-0}
[]{#part0064.xhtml_page_404 .class-0} [nerve impulses, for instance in
the case of manipura chakra, stimulated by a block in blood glucose
which then activates the stomach and the hunger centres in the
hypothalamus, which then activates these mechanisms.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : So you do not believe in a
specific localized energy, but a total body functioning within that
circuit. And one circuit becomes dominant if it is neglected or
overactivated.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Yes. It can be constitutionally
dominant in a person too. You see people who are all manipura chakra, a
lot of drive, ambitions and right in there. They are not sexual people
(swadhisthana motivated) and they might not even have a security drive
(mooladhara motivated). I have known many business people and lawyers
who dabble here and there and do it only for the fun of the game. They
are just very competitive people. Everyone says to the wives, "Well, it
must be great to be married to a guy like that," and they say, "Ugh, he
has little swadhisthana (sex) or anahata chakra (love) working. He is a
bad husband, but makes a very good provider (manipura)."
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : In a study of sociopaths and
those people who are fearless, it was found that there is in fact very
little difference between them. People who are testing jet planes and
rocketships and climbing mountains without ropes etc. have fundamentally
the same character as sociopaths.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : If a person's behaviour is accepted
by society, then he is a hero. If it is unacceptable he is a psychopath.
It reminds me of the old joke that you can murder someone if the
government approves of it. This is interesting because these people have
that same kind of drive. They are driven by an overactive manipura
chakra.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Mooladhara chakra deals principally in security, swadhisthana
principally with pleasure, manipura principally with assertiveness,
courage and personal power, anahata with love, vishuddhi with
communication out and also the ability, mainly because of the perception
of our external]{.class-0} []{#part0064.xhtml_page_405 .class-0}
[environment, to feel at home virtually anywhere. It is a state of
consciousness that is inherent in vishuddhi chakra. When it develops to
a certain point you can be sitting on a pile of garbage and still
everything is just right. Ajna chakra, of course, deals with intellect,
intuition and the psychic power (siddhis) such as telepathy.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[As well as these qualities within the different chakras there is
another parameter, which is the degree of evolution. Each one of us has
these circuits constitutionally energized to different degrees. One
person may have a lot of energization of swadhisthana chakra; that
person is very much pleasure bent, and has perhaps less development at
manipura or anahata.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : That would be very much a
hormonal thing depending mainly on the drive from the hypothalamus.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : That is right. I have not thought
very much about what governs the constitutional factors of it. Each one
of us is proportionately energized differently in different chakra
circuits. Each one of us strikes a different chord. There is a different
frequency of energization of the chakras. There are individual
differences between each one of us, because each one of us has different
degrees of evolution of the quality of the manifestation of each of the
chakras. A sociopath who goes round beating up old ladies to steal their
handbags, and an astronaut, may have the same chord. They may be
identical in the level of activity of each of the chakras, but the guy
who is an astronaut, hopefully, has a higher degree of evolution in most
of his chakras. So these are two important parameters which define the
qualities of the chakras -- percentage of activity and degree of
evolution. These define the character of each person.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : You mentioned that there are
chakras which express energy and certain chakras which take in energy.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : No, what I was saying is that we
know these circuits exist in anatomical form, that there are whole
[]{#part0064.xhtml_page_406} areas down there in the body which do not
only trigger off something up here (in the brain), but are also
triggered by something up here. And we know that there are, for
instance, the hunger and the sensual centres in the hypothalamus. We
know that they are directly connected with the relevant organs in the
body. As the hunger builds up, more neuronal activity builds up within
those circuits. And if an emotional component comes into it, it's very
likely that other parts of the limbic system will start generating
energy too. You will go rushing around to get something to eat as
quickly as possible. This implies that there is an increased neuronal
activity within that circuit.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[People talk about energy within those circuits, and they are certain it
is an energy. They say these circuits are energized because when they
start getting activated, you can feel throbbing, shaking, etc. But is it
energy like electricity running through a wire, or is it in actual fact
only a message like the electricity running through a telephone wire?
The mere fact that a person shakes can mean that it is a message that is
being transmitted to the muscles and the muscles do all the
shaking.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[I tend to prefer the physiological point of view which says that it is
neuronal activity; that is, the nerves and circuits conduct impulses and
the muscles create the shaking and energy.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : But there is energy even in
neuronal activity.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Well, there is, but the energy is
produced secondarily to the neuronal activity. The primary object of the
circuit is to convey an impulse. The message is carried and it uses
energy as a carrier in the same way as a telephone uses energy. You
would not get a telephone wire and try to light a 100 watt bulb, because
there is just not enough energy there. Telephone wires run only on about
2 volts; it is not primarily an energy transmission, but primarily a
message transmission; the energy is a secondary issue and comes from
another source.
:::

::: {#part0064.xhtml_page_407 .class179 lang="en-us"}
[Some people, by their nature, have some of these circuits much more
activated and 'energized' than others. There are some people who are
very much more into the whole manipura thing. They eat a lot and have
big muscles; they are all manipura chakra. You get anahata people who
are very paternal and loving and always sensing other people's feelings,
everywhere they go. The same applies to the other chakras.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Chakra types can be easily seen at a party where there are a whole lot
of people around and you do not know anybody. Then you will see the
person who's very much into feelings will start picking up all over the
place who is kind and who is not kind. That is what he perceives in the
environment. He is predominantly an anahata type. A person who's into
the intellectual trip will listen to all the conversations going on and
if there is good intellectual tone, he will fit into that circle. If a
group is talking about football or something like that, he will go
straight past. He will be the vishuddhi/ajna type. Then you will get the
manipura chap who will notice first of all who's in the power scene and
he will start associating with that. If there is no obvious power
position, it usually develops towards the end of the night. Sometimes
you will go into a place and say "That is it." It is a special chair and
a special place. Now if you are on a power trip you go and sit
there.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[The emotional person, when he perceives the scene, is perceiving the
feelings all around the place, the swadhisthana chap will be seeing
other things such as food, sexual encounters and so on. Each one of us
has a preference in these things, and that preference seems to me to be
driven by energization or activation of those particular circuits which
may be predominating. And some people are balanced and versatile and
will fit into any situation. These people are the yogic
types.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[I think there is an inbuilt rhythm and activation of these particular
circuits within the body. I somehow suspect that we go along on a number
of different levels of consciousness]{.class-0}
[]{#part0064.xhtml_page_408 .class-0} [at the same time. Sometimes we
have dreams of total experiences of something that is going to occur in
three or four months' time. That means time, instead of being a
longitudinal thing, is a vertical thing. How do we explain that in our
neurophysiological framework? There are a lot of experiences that are
difficult to explain scientifically. I don't think that necessarily
means that a physiological explanation is invalid.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[These days it is possible to measure certain physical manifestations of
chakras and the dissociated chakras. Maybe you could get a personality
break of a person who was obviously into a certain chakra and test the
activation of that chakra. I think the energy around the chakra is
easily explainable in that it is the energy that would be given off by
the activated field.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : In terms of circuits, some of
the chakras have more receptive properties, especially in mooladhara and
ajna, whilst certain chakras seem to be more expressive, such as
swadhisthana and manipura.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Probably it is associated with the
jnanendriyas and karmendriyas (sensory and motor nerves).
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : All the chakras must have a
dual purpose: there must be a receptive and active side to them. For
example, ajna is receptive to psychic and intuitive energy, but it also
transmits at the subtle, telepathic level. Vishuddhi, which expresses
and communicates that intuition at the verbal level, simultaneously
expresses compassion felt through anahata, and also expresses the
experiences felt through manipura and swadhisthana. All chakras have a
two-way channel and that is because of ida and pingala.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : I think that vishuddhi expresses the
qualities of the other chakras only as an agent of their quality,
because the other chakras will express energy in a different way. If you
are with a person who is loving, especially if you get close, you can
feel the love pouring out. Therefore, anahata is expressing in that way,
but I think that anahata would use vishuddhi chakra to say the words
that go with it.
:::

::: {#part0064.xhtml_page_409 .class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : Yes, the energy flows through
the other chakras, so the activation of one chakra affects them all and
modifies them according to its major harmonic, but in its own way.
Manipura and swadhisthana chakras would then become love dominant if
anahata becomes active. All the other chakras would then line themselves
up with anahata.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Manipura chakra is an expressive
chakra and if you feel high in manipura, then it would tend to flow out
love more than feel the experience of love, which is anahata.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : There is a definite connection
between mooladhara and ajna. Also, there appears to be a connection
between swadhisthana, vishuddhi and bindu, a very direct connection, and
lalana, which is a sub-chakra of vishuddhi. Then it seems that manipura
and anahata are also related. This intimate connection between the
chakras is symbolized by the seven candles on the Hebrew candlestand
(menorah). This is a representation of how chakras are interacting, but
actually it is a much more complicated diagram in which all chakras
interact with each other. We can regard mooladhara and swadhisthana as
being tamasic chakras, manipura and anahata as being predominantly
rajasic, and vishuddhi and ajna as being sattwic. These pairs function
together. Vishuddhi and ajna, for example, are connected on a receptive,
expressive merger, one being active and the other being receptive.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : But I see rajasic and tamasic
qualities being in each of the chakras and I see the chakras as being
horizontal rather than a vertical ladder form. They all have qualities
from rajasic, right through to sattwic.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : That is also true. Some people
think the word tamasic carries moralistic connotations.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : In the context of evolution, is the
bliss that the yogi experiences any different to the bliss of orgasm? It
might be at a more highly evolved level. Is the selfish love of a mother
for her child, to the exclusion of all other
[]{#part0064.xhtml_page_410} children, anything more than just a lower
level of transcendental love?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : In his article on kundalini,
Carl Jung says that from above manipura chakra you leave the whole
sphere of the earth behind, the individuality -- and the diaphragm which
lies at the manipura level could be an important anatomical separating
component as far as the chakras are concerned. The movement away from
individual love towards universal love takes place at that point just
above the diaphragm -- anahata chakra.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : It is very likely that these
different opinions are all right. The mountain looks different from
different angles, but from above you see all the people looking at the
same mountain. The problem comes when you go back down to earth and talk
to all the individual people. It is very difficult to describe what you
experienced when you saw the whole mountain. This is why we get so many
different opinions, philosophies and religions.

MOOLADHARA AND SWADHISTHANA CHAKRAS
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : Can you discuss the nerve
complexes associated with mooladhara and swadhisthana chakras?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Well, for all of these segments
there are somatic nerves, which deal with the sensory input and the
voluntary motor output, and also there are the autonomic nerves, divided
into sympathetic and parasympathetic. And usually there is an
appropriate endocrine gland for each segment, like the pineal, pituitary
and thyroid. The exception is mooladhara, and to date, medical science
has not found an endocrine gland associated with it. This of course does
not mean that one will not be discovered in the future.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Let us try to work out the psychophysiological aspects of mooladhara.
In the male it is actually associated with the base of the penis and
with the female, the cervix. So it has a very deep-rooted sexual
link.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {#part0064.xhtml_page_411 .class179 lang="en-us"}
[If you repeat a mooladhara chakra mantra and you concentrate in that
area somewhere, you will feel a certain vibration occurring. Now what is
the mantra doing? Is it stimulating some physiological organ, or is it
some sort of occult stimulation? Is it stimulating a physical organ or
is it activating a lot of energy which seems to appear in a certain
place which we call a chakra? I think it is perhaps the last one of
these.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : I believe that the mooladhara
trigger point and the place of actual experience may be different, but
the general location of mooladhara chakra is certainly in the perineum;
it is clearly felt in that area. If it is felt higher, then it is not
mooladhara chakra, it is swadhisthana. Either the mantra is wrong or the
vibration is stimulating something else which is more receptive and
reactive.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Is there a physiological basis for
this? It is quite possible that the repetition of a mantra is
stimulating the spinal cord. You can certainly feel it in the area being
stimulated and it is not only there, because all the fibres that are
coming out from the body are stimulated. Therefore, no matter at what
level you stimulate your spinal cord, no matter what chakra is
stimulated, you are going to collect the fibres from so called
mooladhara chakra. At swadhisthana chakra you will also get the
mooladhara chakra fibres; at manipura you get the mooladhara fibres back
to swadhisthana and manipura as well -- and all the way up. Mooladhara
chakra is always there in the act because its fibres come from the
lowest part.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : Could we consider the sexual
energy of mooladhara and its possible transmutations?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : This basic sexual energy that Gopi
Krishna has written about is actually the sattwic or subtle essence
which can be perceived when the consciousness becomes very sensitive.
This is the essence of the kundalini experience, the sublimation of
sexual energy, the basic life force which is the source of all
generation, regeneration []{#part0064.xhtml_page_412} and reproduction.
Gopi Krishna felt what he was seeing was semen being converted into
energy and distributing itself throughout the body. I feel that what he
was perceiving was a clairvoyant view of energy given off by the simple
nerve fibres in those organs he was talking about. However, he
identified it as semen because that is what is written in the
scriptures. I do not know what women are supposed to have, he did not
mention that and I do not think the scriptures do either.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Nischalananda]{.class5824-1} : The [Hatha Yoga
Pradipika]{.class5827-0} and certain tantric texts do talk about women;
however, generally that side has been neglected. According to yoga the
sexual energy in men and women is sublimated and transmuted into the
ascent of the kundalini. The starting point is mooladhara. For some
reason, the Buddhists say that the ascent commences at manipura, not
mooladhara. How is it that the enlightened Buddha completely bypassed
the two lower chakras? Actually the whole concept of where kundalini
lies is a matter of experience. I don't think that Buddha actually said
that kundalini starts in manipura; more likely he stated that real
spiritual evolution starts from manipura. Swami Satyananda has said many
times that only when the kundalini reaches manipura is it stabilized. It
starts in mooladhara but stabilizes in manipura.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[I think this apparent discrepancy comes because of the philosophy of
Buddha who was a jnani, and he didn't get much into kundalini yoga.
Vajrayana, on the other hand, which was an offshoot of Buddhism at a
later date, is very much concerned with mooladhara. But let us get back
to the functioning of mooladhara.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : Mooladhara chakra has two basic
modes of function, one is energy depleted and the other is energy
activated. Within that system there is a sick and a healthy mooladhara.
What are the symptoms of these different states of mooladhara chakra? It
is simple -- you are either sick or healthy, balanced or unbalanced. If
you are unbalanced you are going to have ida over or under active or
[]{#part0064.xhtml_page_413} pingala over or under active. You are going
to have physical and mental symptoms, fear, insecurity and all those
things. Freud said that everyone who denies mooladhara becomes
constipated and hoards money. Every miser is constipated. These symptoms
may be mild or very extreme. In the fully awakened state they are either
going to rip you to pieces or take you to a higher awareness. So what is
the basic quality of a well functioning mooladhara chakra?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Renunciation.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : We can say that security and
renunciation are interchangeable in the mooladhara system. We can say
that in this chakra basic security is the key. Renunciation obviously
implies security and if you are secure within yourself, you don't need
any external security.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Satyadharma]{.class5824-1} : When awakening of mooladhara takes
place then there is no such problem as insecurity.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Of course, this is the state of
consciousness of an awakened mooladhara. A low energized mooladhara
chakra generally means low vitality, emotional insecurity, fear of the
future. I also think low self-esteem is involved in this. It almost
forms the syndrome of depression, although you don't necessarily have to
get the joylessness of the low energized swadhisthana chakra. If there
is low evolution and high drive in mooladhara, then you get the
ambitious person out to collect as much as he can. He can be a
multimillionaire and still accumulate all sorts of things because he
still feels insecure. The security is a state of consciousness, not a
physical reality. As mooladhara chakra starts to evolve the person
attains security, which is totally unrelated to circumstances.

[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Well, I just see that the mooladhara
circuit in some people is sometimes poorly energized; the whole circuit
itself has low energization. This varies between people and varies
within people, depending upon cosmic events, the position of planets,
the weather and all sorts of things, including psychological factors
such as disappointments, hurts and threats to one's security. It varies
with each of us. Some people are very much in mooladhara; hooked on the
basic sexual aspect of mooladhara in which case they are very much
involved in money and possessions. If they are low energized, they will
still think about these things, but they will not do anything about it.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[I think you need a certain amount of energization to produce the drive
that is inherent in each chakra; the basic sexual hunting drive in
swadhisthana chakra, the territorial and dominance drive in manipura and

parameters, the amount of energization of each chakra and the degree of
evolution.]{.class-0}

line.]{.class-0}

[Swami Satyadharma]{.class5824-1} : So does pooled energy act to block
or can it be used to activate the chakra? For example, if a person has a

could that pooled energy be utilized to activate and awaken a chakra?

place consciously, whilst having an unconscious or subconscious blockage
leads to repression.

[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : Do you think that the basic
energy at mooladhara is anxiety, fear, or is it insecurity?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : The basic emotion? Well, it depends
on the energization of the circuit. If there is not much energy, it will
tend to be depression and hopelessness. But if there is a lot of energy,
it will then depend upon the evolution of the chakra. If it is little
evolved, then there will be intense insecurity, which is anxiety. If it
is highly evolved there will be a sense of oneness and complete
security. Generally mooladhara is blocked to some extent in most people
and blockages may manifest as muscle tension.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[Muscle tensions are manifestations of the circuits of mental blockages,
samskaras. It is the samskaras that keep down the evolution of the
quality of consciousness that is within these chakra circuits. I think
that low evolution, muscle spasms and the maladjustments of the
organisms that are supplied by that part of the autonomic nervous system
are due to psychic tensions.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : These psychic and personality
tensions are due to various events in the environment.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : That is right. The inner unconscious
conflicts coming into conflict with certain events in the environment.
For example, if a person feels very insecure and someone steals a
valuable possession from him, he may go into an absolute frenzy. This is
opposed to the reaction of someone else who does not have the same sort
of conflicts and insecurities.
:::

::: {#part0064.xhtml_page_416 .class179 lang="en-us"}
[If a person cannot express the feeling that is involved at mooladhara,
that feeling can express itself in somatic problems like spasms of the
muscles, in autonomic problems, blood pressure, constipation, and who
knows what else, maybe functional urethritis, cystitis, colitis,
rectitis, dysmenorrhea and so on.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class4233 lang="en-us"}
PSYCHOSIS
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : Would you associate a highly
energized, low evolved mooladhara problem as the cause of manic
depression?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : I think manic depression is an
ida/pingala thing. We are in another dimension there, because a manic
person will undergo all the manifestations of a very highly energized
and controlled chakra. He will be rushing around gambling all his money
away, trying to get more, getting into all sorts of sexual exploits,
going round pushing other people around, the rajasic aspect.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Sambuddhananda]{.class5824-1} : Would you say that schizophrenia
and paranoia are related with ida and pingala imbalance?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Yes, there are people who are stuck
in ida. Ida is very much overactive. It is interesting that research
shows that the taking in of negative aspects of the environment through
the right hemisphere (ida) is paranoia. This is what paranoia is all
about. A lot of people, some of them quite highly evolved people, who
have specialized much in ida are a bit paranoid. Ida seems to have a
negative aspect about it. Even if you come into it at a high level of
consciousness, it seems to have a bit of a negative pull. If you are
going to activate your chakras, you have to make sure your ida and
pingala are balanced.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : But manic depression, psychosis
and other mental problems relate to either mooladhara or ajna because it
is only at these two points that you have the fusion of ida and pingala.
Therefore, psychosis, manic depression and all these things would seem
to relate very []{#part0064.xhtml_page_417} much to the mooladhara/ajna
circuit. If ida and pingala are coming out of mooladhara chakra, then
what would be the mechanism dealing with psychosis?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : I think that ida and pingala are
only related to the activities of the cerebral hemispheres.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : But the whole body is
controlled by the hemispheres. The whole body gets the energy. Arteries
and veins, sensory and motor nerves, right and left hemispheres are all
reflections of the ida and pingala process.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : I see ida and pingala anatomically
up here in the brain, not crossing down the spine. I believe that ida
and pingala crossing each other is a concept and a symbol of experience.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Satyadharma]{.class5824-1} : I think that awakening of mooladhara
is the beginning of psychic awareness. That is why with mooladhara
awakening, people often become disturbed.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Yes. They can get caught in the
psychic consciousness, which is the consciousness in which you have
hallucinations, etc.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : It is much more powerful than
anything they have ever experienced before.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : We slide in and out of it twice a
day anyway, even if we are not doing any formal closed eye meditation
techniques. I think if you hold the awareness at the psychic level, and
you can do it with yoga nidra, you will experience a state in which
there is thought blocking -- what is called thought disorder -- where
one thought leads on to another one that is unrelated to it and it just
goes off into the distance. Paradoxical thinking -- where two
paradoxical things can exist together, hallucinations, voices talking to
you, you see things and so forth.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : So, therefore we assume that
pingala is blocked and ida is flowing. All that stuff is coming out
through ida from mooladhara; basic subconscious material.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : At the same time there is psychic
withdrawal.
:::

::: {#part0064.xhtml_page_418 .class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : Yes, so what does that imply?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : If there is a psychic withdrawal,
then even though we appear to be in communication with the outside, in
actual fact we are still inside from the psychic point of view.
Paradoxical thinking, suspicious feelings, voices and all these things,
and not being able to keep your thoughts together on one topic for any
more than a couple of seconds; all these come from a psychic, inner
plane.
:::

::: {.class4233 lang="en-us"}
PHYSICAL DISEASES
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : What about physical disease
associated with mooladhara chakra problems? We have already talked about
constipation; this of course brings about things like haemorrhoids.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : There are many types of constipation
involved too -- of energy, emotions, information -- all inherent in
mooladhara chakra as hoarding of any type.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Gaurishankar]{.class5824-1} : What about disease?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Statistics involved in diseases in
this area tend to relate to the manipura and anahata areas, and the
diseases of hypertension, heart problems, peptic ulcers etc. I assume
many diseases of the lower excretory and reproductive organs are
associated with a malfunctioning mooladhara.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : Cancer?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Yes, of the rectum and bladder.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : The helplessness associated
with it too?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : I don't know if it is all cancers we
are talking about now. I don't know if they would be segmental or not.
Hypertension, for instance, appears to be a generalized condition. It is
mainly related to the manipura chakra circuits. Cancer may well be a
generalized condition that is related to one of the chakras, perhaps
mooladhara.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Paramananda]{.class5824-1} : How far can you take the
relationship between the chakras and the physical organs like the heart?
[]{#part0064.xhtml_page_419} If the heart is not functioning well and it
affects the anahata chakra which is love, can that also mean that there
is a lack of love going through that person and physically it comes out
in anahata chakra and the heart as disease?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Yes, it can be in both. If a person
has a need to receive love and it is not coming, and/or that person has
imbalanced constructions of love, then anahata problems can arise in the
form of cardiac problems such as angina, palpitations, etc.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Paramananda]{.class5824-1} : Do you think that applies to all the
chakras? If you find a particular organ not functioning in a sick
person, does it mean there is a deficiency of the qualities of the
chakra related to that part of the body?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : As a general rule, yes, but you can
get other problems as well. For instance, you can get an activation of
manipura chakra, which activates the sympathetic nervous system which
produces restriction of the coronary artery.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[There is interaction between the different chakras, and this is the
beauty of a well-taught yoga class -- it balances all these qualities,
and balance is the key to the whole thing. Rather than trying to work on
one area, which is a more specific medical style, yoga therapy works on
the whole human structure.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Muktibodhananda]{.class5824-1} : How do the physical organs
relate to the chakras and spiritual evolution?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Consider hysterectomy. Let us assume
the wrong woman is wheeled into the operating theatre and she has a
hysterectomy. This will then cut off the end organ for a lot of nerve
fibres and the atrophy will run up the nerves and eliminate the brain
centres involved in that. This is an example of a deficiency in the
organ producing changes in the centres involved, the circuit. Does that
make it any more difficult for her to realize higher aspects of
swadhisthana chakra?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : It depends how much of the
centre is lost. If she just loses the uterus and not the ovaries, for
example, all the hormonal secretions will be maintained.
[]{#part0064.xhtml_page_420} As women reach menopause they will undergo
a natural hysterectomy.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Yes, but they don't lose the nerve
endings. When the uterus is removed, because the nerve endings are
useless, they atrophy. Does this affect the associated chakras?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Nischalananda]{.class5824-1} : Swami Satyananda says it does not
make any difference if there is a vasectomy, because it is only the
physical body. I think, as regards swadhisthana for example, that if
they are already on the spiritual path and have developed some psychic
awareness, then that operation would definitely not affect them much, if
at all. If they had no background of yogic practise, then probably the
destruction of that organ would slightly hamper progress, because
initially you depend upon those organs to stimulate something,
especially in the practices of hatha and kriya yoga. If you follow the
path of bhakti or jnana yoga, of course, it makes no difference.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : If you lose one centre or two
centres, physically I think it does not hinder you because a lot of
other centres are left. There are tons of potential left within the
brain.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : To sum up, we function on physical,
emotional, mental, psychic and spiritual levels. The chakras span all
these levels. The purpose of yoga and tantra is to stimulate the chakras
at all these levels. Then, and only then, can we become healthy human
beings.
:::

::: {.class4233 lang="en-us"}
MENTAL PROBLEMS
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Sambuddhananda]{.class5824-1} : What is the cause of depression?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : I think low activation of the
swadhisthana circuit is the prime cause of depression.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : I thought it was due to low
activation in mooladhara.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Well, the qualities in both these
chakras are very close.
:::

::: {#part0064.xhtml_page_421 .class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : So what is the difference
between mooladhara and swadhisthana?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : You can see the different qualities
in the various types of anxiety you see in different people. In
psychiatry, the various forms of anxiety all come under the name of
anxiety, yet they are all different syndromes, and they are also related
to different chakra circuits. People with a low energized mooladhara
chakra are not just apprehensive about the future, they also feel
insecure about the present. They simply don't feel that this is a secure
world, and the state of consciousness they have at any time is that
things are dangerous.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[There is another type of depression which I perceived in a woman who
was forty-five years of age. Her husband had left her when she was about
thirty-five, and she led a very quiet life. But she was still pretty
energized in swadhisthana chakra. She was describing the anxiety that
she had. Through empathy I started to experience what she was
describing. It was a sort of quivering vibration going on in the pelvis.
It was a quivering all around the area of swadhisthana chakra, not
specifically genital, but all around the upper part of the pelvis. It
really was a type of anxiety.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[I gave her the general swadhisthana practices such as shalabhasana,
etc. She improved a lot. The yogic practices seemed to deactivate her
pent-up emotion. I think it was just sexual tension that she had in that
area and she was perceiving it as anxiety. She also had a fear of it
because she did not know what it was.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[There is another case of depression which is a well-known one --
butterflies in the stomach, accompanied by palpitations, which is just
activation of the sympathetic nervous system. One case I saw was a taxi
driver who had a minor accident in his cab. He got this phobia and he
couldn't get in his taxi without experiencing butterflies. In Aruba
(South America), where he lived, taxi fares are minimal so that the taxi
drivers are really hard up. This man had to employ someone else to drive
his cab for him and he was]{.class-0} []{#part0064.xhtml_page_422
.class-0} [losing money. He had been off work for six weeks. Every time
he went up to his cab he would get this terrible churning in the stomach
and he developed hypertension. He was a very dynamic Aries.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[So I thought, "What to do?" I taught him kunjal in order to get all
that energy out of manipura chakra. He did it once in the ashram and
then immediately went out and got in his cab. This type of anxiety and
depression is obviously manipura overactivity.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[There is another type of anxiety which arises through too much
thinking: "Wouldn't it be terrible if such and such happened, and if
that happens maybe something else will happen, and if that happens maybe
. . .?" People with this problem just think and think and think, until
that preoccupation produces a fear within them which is not necessarily
contained in the symptoms. That is dealt with by practising bhramari
pranayama. So within the diagnosis of anxiety there seems to be these
four types. There may be others related to the other chakras, but I have
not yet noticed them.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Nischalananda]{.class5824-1} : Maybe stuttering, loss of voice
and things like that, related to vishuddhi, can be cured by simhasana.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Exactly, tightening up of the
throat. It seems to be more related to a lack of self-confidence rather
than the feeling of anxiety. Simhasana works wonders.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[When I was in general practice, I used to do a lot of spinal
adjustments and manipulation, and after a while I specialized in spinal
problems. I did a lot of backs at that stage. I found that patients came
in clusters. I would get a lot of people with an upper cervical lesion,
migraine headaches, tightness in the neck region, with all the symptoms
of chronic sinusitis and all the other things related to upper cervical
tension.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[I found that all the people with upper cervical problems were coming in
when the moon was full, all the people with lumbar/sacral problems were
coming in when the moon was new, and in between all the others were
spread out. This is]{.class-0} []{#part0064.xhtml_page_423 .class-0}
[interesting because it is related to chakra activation. Almost before
the patient told me, I could pinpoint the exact spinal segment in which
he would be having problems. I knew according to the moon phase. This
relationship became obvious, especially towards the end of the time I
was manipulating, because I took on the symptoms of my
patients.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : This means that we need a whole
set of asanas working on all the segments of the spine.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Yes, we have them, for example,
surya namaskara. In Australia we used to use the leg lock posture for
mooladhara chakra; shalabhasana and bhujangasana for swadhisthana
chakra. These asanas are actually supposed to be for manipura chakra,
but so many people have such stiff backs that they activate swadhisthana
chakra instead. Then paschimottanasana and dhanurasana for manipura; for
anahata, supta vajrasana and matsyasana; for vishuddhi, sarvangasana;
and for ajna chakra, sirshasana and ashwa sanchalanasana. Halasana also
activates vishuddhi because the inflection is brought right up to the
upper cervical area. However, people who have a stiff upper cervical
spine should not do any of those upper spine flexion practices, because
the discs are very tiny at that part and these asanas can be too much.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Nischalananda]{.class5824-1} : Khandharasana is good for this
area. It's not so strong because a lot of the body weight is taken by
the feet.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Gaurishankar]{.class5824-1} : Let us get back to the subject of
depression.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : I think there are different
qualities in the thing that we call depression. The dread of the future
is one of the symptoms of depression and I think it is a mooladhara
chakra problem. But the dejection, lack of joy and loss of sense of
humour that you find in many people is due to a low energized
swadhisthana. With a low energized manipura comes loss of appetite and
low emotional activity.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[In depression there is a vicious circle; the whole mechanism, the whole
noradrenalin/dopamine mechanism]{.class-0} []{#part0064.xhtml_page_424
.class-0} [seems to slow down. It involves hormones. Most of the
anti-depressants act upon this noradrenalin/dopamine system.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : I would also imagine that
depletion of testosterone, excessive sexual activity, depletion of
adrenaline, excessive fear and anxiety, etc., all lead to a depressed
state.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : That is right. I have often
suspected too, that when the moon is new for instance, then people tend
to function to some extent on the energy of the lower chakras. The other
ones are functioning too, but it is the lower chakras that are carrying
a lot of the energy. Actually, the normal person experiences a depressed
feeling lasting a couple of days during that phase. Then the moon starts
activating the other chakras and the person comes out of it.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Nischalananda]{.class5824-1} : This relationship is also
indicated by the fact that some people go crazy at the time of full
moon. It means that energy comes up to and accumulates at ajna chakra.
The high energy affects the mind.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : It is strange that the medical
profession denies that the full moon has any effect on the mental state
of people, and there are comprehensive statistics from psychiatric
hospitals to show that the admission rate is no higher at the time of
the full moon than it is at the time of new moon. To this I say that
there are different conditions for which people are being admitted at
the time of the full moon and at the time of the new moon; this can be
seen most clearly.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : In hospitals, all the nursing
staff knows that when the full moon comes there are going to be
problems. There will be more road accidents, more crazy people coming in
and people going off their heads, etc.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Muktibodhananda]{.class5824-1} : What is the difference between
fear, anxiety and phobia?
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Fear is a normal response to a
threatening situation. If a tiger came into this room, nine people would
be frightened and that would be a natural response. Anxiety, on the
other hand, is really a collection []{#part0064.xhtml_page_425} of
symptoms which go on for a long time, usually not provoked by an
external situation. Phobias are immediate responses, just like fear,
except that the responses are to a non-threatening situation. A mouse a
hundred yards down the corridor, for instance, would not affect any of
us, but someone with a phobia about mice would panic.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : Phobias are actually a
displacement from an original object on to a different situation.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : That is the ego-defence mechanism
that Freud used to talk about. Freud used to talk about anxiety, psychic
complexes and so on, but the man in the taxi who had butterflies in the
stomach did have an accident which may have activated some old samskara
somewhere, which turned into a full fear of getting into his taxi. But
the whole thing was cleared so quickly; it was not deep-seated.
Sometimes I believe these things just build up in a susceptible moment
rather than in a susceptible person. They build up from a small bit of
anxiety to a bigger anxiety on the basis of a vicious circle. You break
that vicious circle anywhere and the whole thing just dissolves.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : The longer it is sustained the
more difficult it is to break.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : Each chakra has its own work to
perform and if one centre is blocked or diseased, then another centre
takes over its work. Because this work or function is being done by
another centre, it becomes perverted. This happens a lot if a person is
inhibited in swadhisthana chakra. Manipura will take over the work and
then the sexual activities will be just a power play, competition and
that sort of stuff -- completely perverted.
:::

::: {.class179 lang="en-us"}
[This perversion also occurs if manipura chakra takes over the job of
anahata. It is seen in do-gooders, those people who come and force you,
almost by threats of violence, to let them help you.]{.class-0}
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Shankardevananda]{.class5824-1} : Another example is of those
persons who get involved in a sexual encounter to fulfil the anahata
centre, and of course they don't get that fulfilment.
[]{#part0064.xhtml_page_426} This can lead to problems in marriage and
all the things you were saying about perversion of normal function.
:::

::: {.class52 lang="en-us"}
[Swami Vivekananda]{.class5824-1} : So the purpose of yoga is to balance
the functioning of the chakras and at the same time to awaken the
associated energies. Only then can we function as joyful, spontaneous
human beings, without depression, psychosis or physical problems. Only
when we balance and awaken all the chakras can life become meaningful.

[Swami Satyananda]{.class6002} was born in Almora (Uttaranchal) in 1923.
Drawn to spiritual life from an early age, he left home at the age of
eighteen, and in 1943 surrendered himself to Swami Sivananda in
Rishikesh who initiated him into Dashnami sannyasa in 1947. He served
his guru for twelve years, perfecting every aspect of spiritual life.
Thereafter, he travelled throughout the Indian subcontinent as a
wandering ascetic.

[Realizing the need of the times as scientific rendition of the ancient
system of yoga, he founded the International Yoga Fellowship in 1956 and
the Bihar School of Yoga in 1963. During the next twenty years, Swami
Satyananda hoisted the flag of yoga in every corner of the world,
consolidated BSY into a foremost institution of yoga, and authored over
eighty major texts on yoga, tantra and spiritual life.]{.class-8}

['Satyananda Yoga' became a tradition which combines classical knowledge
with experiential understanding and a modern outlook. In 1984 he founded
the Yoga Research Foundation to synchronize scientific research and
yoga, and Sivananda Math to assist the underprivileged. In 1988, at the
peak of his achievements, he renounced everything and adopted kshetra
sannyasa, living as a paramahamsa ascetic. In 1989 Rikhia was revealed
to him, where he came to live and performed higher vedic sadhanas in
seclusion. Receiving the command to provide for his neighbours in 1991,
he allowed the ashram to help the underprivileged villages in the
region. From 1995 onwards, he performed a twelve-year Rajasooya Yajna
with the sankalpa of peace, plenty and prosperity for all, and in 2007
he announced the establishment of Rikhiapeeth with its mandate to
'serve, love, give'.]{.class-8}

[Swami Satyananda attained mahasamadhi, a yogic accomplishment of
discarding the body at will to become one with the universal
consciousness, in 2009, in the presence of his disciples.]{.class-8}
