      Mindfulness
      in the Age of
       Complexity

An interview with Ellen Langer by Alison Beard

                      1

O ver nearly four decades, Ellen Langer's re- search on mindfulness has greatly inﬂuenced thinking across a range of ﬁelds, from be- havioral economics to positive psychology. It reveals that by paying attention to what's going on around us, instead of operating on autopilot, we can reduce stress, unlock creativity, and boost performance. Her "counterclockwise" experiments, for example, demonstrated that elderly men could improve their health by simply acting as if it were 20 years earlier. In this interview with senior editor Alison Beard, Langer applies her thinking to leadership and man- agement in an age of increasing chaos.

                          3

Mindfulness

HBR: Let's start with the basics. What, exactly, is mindfulness? How do you deﬁne it?

Langer: Mindfulness is the process of actively no- ticing new things. When you do that, it puts you in the present. It makes you more sensitive to context and perspective. It's the essence of engagement. And it's energy-begetting, not energy-consuming. The mistake most people make is to assume it's stressful and exhausting---all this thinking. But what's stressful is all the mindless negative evalu- ations we make and the worry that we'll ﬁnd prob- lems and not be able to solve them. We all seek stability. We want to hold things still, thinking that if we do, we can control them. But since everything is always changing, that doesn't work. Actually, it causes you to lose control. Take work processes. When people say, "This is the way to do it," that's not true. There are al- ways many ways, and the way you choose should

                           4

Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity

depend on the current context. You can't solve to- day's problems with yesterday's solutions. So when someone says, "Learn this so it's second nature," let a bell go off in your head, because that means mindlessness. The rules you were given were the rules that worked for the person who created them, and the more different you are from that person, the worse they're going to work for you. When you're mindful, rules, routines, and goals guide you; they don't govern you.

What are some of the speciﬁc beneﬁts of being more mindful, according to your research?

Better performance, for one. We did a study with symphony musicians, who, it turns out, are bored to death. They're playing the same pieces over and over again, and yet it's a high-status job that they can't easily walk away from. So we had groups of them perform. Some were told to replicate a

                             5

Mindfulness

previous performance they'd liked---that is, to play pretty mindlessly. Others were told to make their individual performance new in subtle ways---to play mindfully. Remember: This wasn't jazz, so the changes were very subtle indeed. But when we played recordings of the symphonies for peo- ple who knew nothing about the study, they over- whelmingly preferred the mindfully played pieces. So here we had a group performance where every- body was doing their own thing, and it was better. There's this view that if you let everyone do their own thing, chaos will reign. When people are do- ing their own thing in a rebellious way, yes, it might. But if everyone is working in the same con- text and is fully present, there's no reason why you shouldn't get a superior coordinated performance. There are many other advantages to mindful- ness. It's easier to pay attention. You remember more of what you've done. You're more creative. You're able to take advantage of opportunities

                        6

Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity

when they present themselves. You avert the dan- ger not yet arisen. You like people better, and peo- ple like you better, because you're less evaluative. You're more charismatic. The idea of procrastination and regret can go away, because if you know why you're doing some- thing, you don't take yourself to task for not doing something else. If you're fully present when you decide to prioritize this task or work at this ﬁrm or create this product or pursue this strategy, why would you regret it? I've been studying this for nearly 40 years, and for almost any measure, we ﬁnd that mindfulness generates a more positive result. That makes sense when you realize it's a superordinate variable. No matter what you're doing---eating a sandwich, do- ing an interview, working on some gizmo, writing a report---you're doing it mindfully or mindlessly. When it's the former, it leaves an imprint on what you do. At the very highest levels of any ﬁeld---

                           7

Mindfulness

Fortune 50 CEOs, the most impressive artists and musicians, the top athletes, the best teachers and mechanics---you'll ﬁnd mindful people, because that's the only way to get there.

How have you shown a link between mindfulness and innovation?

With Gabriel Hammond, a graduate student, I ran a study where we asked participants to come up with new uses for products that had failed. We primed one group for mindlessness by telling them how the product had fallen short of its original in- tended use---to cite a famous example from 3M, a failed glue. We primed the other for mindfulness by simply describing the product's properties--- a substance that adheres for only a short amount of time. Of course, the most creative ideas for new uses came from the second group.

                          8

Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity

    I’m an artist as well as a researcher, writer, and

consultant---each activity informs the others for me---and I got the idea to study mindfulness and mistakes when I was painting. I looked up and saw I was using ocher when I'd meant to use magenta, so I started trying to ﬁx it. But then I realized I'd made the decision to use magenta only seconds be- fore. People do this all the time. You start with un- certainty, you make a decision, and if you make a mistake, it's a calamity. But the path you were fol- lowing was just a decision. You can change it at any time, and maybe an alternative will turn out better. When you're mindful, mistakes become friends.

How does being mindful make someone more charis- matic?

We've shown this in a few studies. An early one was with magazine salespeople: The mindful ones

                             9

Mindfulness

sold more and were rated as more likable by buy- ers. More recently, we've looked at the bind that women executives face: If they act in strong, ste- reotypically masculine ways, they're seen as bitchy, but if they act feminine, they're seen as weak and not leadership material. So we asked two groups of women to give persuasive speeches. One group was told to act masculine, the other to act femi- nine. Then half of each group was instructed to give their speech mindfully, and we found that au- diences preferred the mindful speakers, regardless of what gender role they were playing out.

And mindfulness also makes you less judgmental about others?

Yes. We all have a tendency to mindlessly pigeon- hole people: He's rigid. She's impulsive. But when

                         10

Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity

you freeze someone in that way, you don't get the chance to enjoy a relationship with them or use their talents. Mindfulness helps you to appreciate why people behave the way they do. It makes sense to them at the time, or else they wouldn't do it. We did a study in which we asked people to rate their own character traits---the things they would most like to change and the things they most val- ued about themselves---and we found a big irony. The traits that people valued tended to be positive versions of the ones they wanted to change. So the reason I personally can't stop being impulsive is that I value being spontaneous. That means if you want to change my behavior, you'll have to persuade me not to like spontaneity. But chances are that when you see me from this proper perspective--- spontaneous rather than impulsive---you won't want to change me.

                          11

Mindfulness

             Mindful management

What else can managers do to be more mindful?

One tactic is to imagine that your thoughts are to- tally transparent. If they were, you wouldn't think awful things about other people. You'd ﬁnd a way to understand their perspective. And when you're upset about something--- maybe someone turned in an assignment late or didn't do it the way you wanted---ask yourself, "Is it a tragedy or an inconvenience?" It's probably the latter. Most of the things that get us upset are. I also tell people to think about work/life inte- gration, not balance. "Balance" suggests that the two are opposite and have nothing in common. But that's not true. They're both mostly about peo- ple. There are stresses in both. There are schedules

                          12

Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity

to be met. If you keep them separate, you don't learn to transfer what you do successfully in one domain to the other. When we're mindful, we re- alize that categories are person constructed and don't limit us. Remember, too, that stress is not a function of events; it's a function of the view you take of events. You think a particular thing is going to happen and that when it does, it's going to be awful. But predic- tion is an illusion. We can't know what's going to happen. So give yourself ﬁve reasons you won't lose the job. Then think of ﬁve reasons why, if you did, it would be an advantage---new opportunities, more time with family, et cetera. Now you've gone from thinking it's deﬁnitely going to happen to thinking maybe it will and even if it does, you'll be OK. If you feel overwhelmed by your responsibili- ties, use the same approach. Question the belief that you're the only one who can do it, that there's only one way to do it, and that the company will

                          13

Mindfulness

collapse if you don't do it. When you open your views to be mindful, the stress just dissipates. Mindfulness helps you realize that there are no positive or negative outcomes. There's A, B, C, D, and more, each with its challenges and opportunities. Give me some scenarios, and I'll explain how mindfulness helps.

I'm the leader of a team in dissent. People are argu- ing vehemently for different strategies, and I have to decide on one.

There's an old story about two people coming be- fore a judge. One guy tells his side of the story, and the judge says, "That's right." The other guy tells his side of the story, and the judge says, "That's right." They say, "We can't both be right." And the judge says, "That's right." We have this mindless notion

                           14

Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity

to settle disputes with a choice between this way or that way, or a compromise. But win-win solu- tions can almost always be sought. Instead of let- ting people lock into their positions, go back and open it up. Have opponents play the debate from the other side so that they realize there are good arguments either way. Then ﬁnd a way for both of them to be right.

I'm an executive with lots of commitments who's facing a personal crisis.

If I couldn't do this interview because I was hav- ing a problem at home, I would say, "Alison, I hope you'll forgive me, but my mind is elsewhere right now because I'm having this crisis." And you might say, "Oh, no, I had a crisis last week. It's OK. I un- derstand." And then, when the crisis was over, we could come back to what we were doing, but with a

                             15

Mindfulness

whole new relationship, which would set us up for all sorts of good things in the future.

I'm a boss giving a review to an underperforming employee.

Make clear that the evaluation is your perspective, not a universal one, which opens up the dialogue. Let's say a student or a worker adds one and one and gets one. The teacher or employer can just say "Wrong," or he can try to ﬁgure out how the person got to one. Then the worker says, "If you add one wad of chewing gum to another wad, one plus one equals one." Now the boss has learned something. As a leader, you can walk around as if you're God and get everybody to quiver. But then you're not going to learn anything, because they're not going to tell you, and you're going to be lonely and unhappy. It doesn't have to be lonely at the top. You can be there and be open.

                          16

Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity

How do you create a more mindful organization?

When I'm doing consulting work with companies, I usually start by showing everyone how mindless they are and what they're missing as a result. You can be mindless only if two conditions are met: You've found the very best way of doing things, and nothing changes. Of course, those conditions can't be met. So if you're going to work, you should be there and notice things. Then I explain that there are alternative ways of getting anywhere, and in fact, you can't even be sure that the destina- tion you've chosen is ultimately where you'll want to be. Everything looks different from different perspectives. I tell leaders they should make not know- ing OK---I don't know, you don't know, nobody knows---rather than acting like they know, so everyone else pretends they know, which leads to all sorts of discomfort and anxiety. Eliminate

                            17

Mindfulness

zero-accident policies. If you have a zero-accident policy, you're going to have a maximum-lying policy. Get people to ask, "Why? What are the beneﬁts of doing it this way versus another way?" When you do that, everyone relaxes a little, and you're all better able to see and take advantage of opportunities. I was working with a nursing home years ago, and a nurse walked in, complaining that one of the residents didn't want to go to the dining room. She wanted to stay in her room and eat peanut butter. So I butted in and said, "What's wrong with that?" Her answer was "What if everybody wants to do it?" And I said, "Well, if everybody did it, you'd save a lot of money on food. But, more seriously, it would tell you something about how the food is being prepared or served. If it's only one person occasionally, what's the big deal? If it happens all the time, there's an opportunity here."

                       18

Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity

I imagine you don't like checklists?

The ﬁrst time you go through a checklist, it's ﬁne. But after that, most people tend to do it mind- lessly. So in aviation you have ﬂaps up, throttle open, anti-ice off. But if snow is coming and the anti-ice is off, the plane crashes. Checklists aren't bad if they require qualita- tive information to be obtained in that moment. For example, "Please note the weather conditions. Based on these conditions, should the anti-ice be on or off?" or "How is the patient's skin color dif- ferent from yesterday?" If you ask questions that encourage mindfulness, you bring people into the present and you're more likely to avoid an accident. Mindful, qualitative comments help in interper- sonal relationships, too, by the way. If you're giving a compliment, "You look great" is not nearly as ef- fective as something like "Your eyes are sparkling

                             19

Mindfulness

today." To say that, you have to be there, and peo- ple will recognize and appreciate it.

            Mindfulness and focus

The business environment has changed a lot since you began studying mindfulness. It's more complex and uncertain. We have new data and analysis coming at us all the time. So mindfulness becomes more impor- tant for navigating the chaos---but the chaos makes it a lot harder to be mindful.

I think chaos is a perception. People say that there's too much information, and I would say that there's no more information now than there was before. The difference is that people believe they have to know it---that the more information they have, the better the product is going to be and the more

                          20

Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity

money the company is going to make. I don't think it depends as much on the amount of information someone has as on the way it's taken in. And that needs to be mindfully.

How has technology changed our ability to be mind- ful? Is it a help or a hindrance?

Again, one can bring mindfulness to anything. We've studied multitasking and found that if you're open and keep the boundaries loose, it can be an advantage. The information from one thing can help you with another. I think what we should do is learn from the way technology is fun and compelling and build that into our work.

HBR recently published an article on the importance of focus in which the author, Daniel Goleman, talks about the need for both exploration and exploita- tion. How do you balance mindfulness---constantly

                             21

Mindfulness

looking for the new---with the ability to buckle down and get things done?

Vigilance, or very focused attention, is probably mindless. If I'm racing through the woods on horseback, watching the branches so that I don't get hit in the face, I might miss the boulder on the ground, so then my horse stumbles and I'm thrown off. But I don't think that's what Dan means by focus. What you want is a soft openness---to be attentive to the things you're doing but not single-minded, because then you're missing other opportunities.

We hear the management community talking more about mindfulness now. When did you realize that the ideas you've been studying for decades had be- come mainstream?

I was at a party, and two different people came up to me and said, "Your mindfulness is everywhere."

                           22

Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity

Of course, I just saw a new ﬁlm that starts with someone going around Harvard Square asking people what mindfulness is, and nobody knows. So there's still a lot of work to do.

What are you working on next?

The Langer Mindfulness Institute works in three arenas: health, aging, and the workplace. In health we want to see just how far we can push the mind- body notion. Years ago we did studies on chamber- maids (who lost weight after being told their work was exercise) and vision (where people did better on eye tests that had them work up from large let- ters at the bottom to small ones at the top, creat- ing the expectation that they would be able to read them). Now we're trying a mindfulness cure on many diseases that people think are uncon- trollable to see if we can at least ameliorate the symptoms. We're also doing counterclockwise re- treats around the world, starting in San Miguel

                             23

Mindfulness

de Allende, Mexico, using research-proven tech- niques to help people live boldly. And we're doing conferences and consulting on work/life integra- tion, mindful leadership and strategy processes, stress reduction, and innovation, with companies such as Thorlo and Santander and NGOs such as CARE and Vermont's Energy Action Network. I'm told that I drive my students crazy because I'm always coming up with new ideas. I'm thinking about maybe a mindfulness camp for children. One exercise might be to take a group of 20 kids and keep dividing them into subsets---male/female, younger/older, dark hair/light hair, wearing black/ not wearing black---until they realize that everyone is unique. As I've said for 30 years, the best way to decrease prejudice is to increase discrimination. We would also play games and midway through mix up the teams. Or maybe we'd give each child a chance to rewrite the rules of the game, so it becomes clear that performance is only a reﬂec- tion of one's ability under certain circumstances.

                        24

Mindfulness in the Age of Complexity

You know, if they allowed three serves in tennis, I would be a much better player.

What's the one thing about mindfulness you'd like every executive to remember?

It's going to sound corny, but I believe it fully: Life consists only of moments, nothing more than that. So if you make the moment matter, it all matters. You can be mindful, you can be mindless. You can win, you can lose. The worst case is to be mindless and lose. So when you're doing anything, be mind- ful, notice new things, make it meaningful to you, and you'll prosper.

Mindfulness Can Literally Change Your Brain

By Christina Congleton, Britta K. Hölzel, and Sara W. Lazar

                   27

T he business world is abuzz with mindfulness. But perhaps you haven't heard that the hype is backed by hard science. Recent research pro- vides strong evidence that practicing nonjudgmen- tal, present-moment awareness (aka mindfulness) changes the brain, and it does so in ways that anyone working in today's complex business environment--- and certainly every leader---should know about.1 We contributed to this research in 2011 with a study on participants who completed an eight-week mindfulness program.2 We observed signiﬁcant in- creases in the density of their gray matter. In the years since, neuroscience laboratories from around

                         29

Mindfulness

the world have also investigated ways in which medi- tation, one key way to practice mindfulness, changes the brain. This year, a team of scientists from the University of British Columbia and the Chemnitz University of Technology were able to pool data from more than 20 studies to determine which areas of the brain are consistently affected.3 They identiﬁed at least eight different regions. Here we will focus on two that we believe to be of particular interest to business professionals. The ﬁrst is the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a structure located deep inside the forehead, behind the brain's frontal lobe. The ACC is associated with self-regulation, meaning the ability to purposefully direct attention and behavior, suppress inappropri- ate knee-jerk responses, and switch strategies ﬂex- ibly.4 People with damage to the ACC show impul- sivity and unchecked aggression, and those with impaired connections between this and other brain regions perform poorly on tests of mental ﬂexibility:

                          30

Mindfulness Can Literally Change Your Brain

They hold onto ineffective problem-solving strategies rather than adapting their behavior.5 Meditators, on the other hand, demonstrate superior performance on tests of self-regulation, resisting distractions and making correct answers more often than non- meditators.6 They also show more activity in the ACC than nonmeditators.7 In addition to self-regulation, the ACC is associated with learning from past experi- ence to support optimal decision making.8 Scientists point out that the ACC may be particularly important in the face of uncertain and fast-changing conditions. The second brain region we want to highlight is the hippocampus, a region that showed increased amounts of gray matter in the brains of our 2011 mindfulness program participants. This seahorse- shaped area is buried inside the temple on each side of the brain and is part of the limbic system, a set of inner structures associated with emotion and memory. It is covered in receptors for the stress hor- mone cortisol, and studies have shown that it can be

                              31

Mindfulness

damaged by chronic stress, contributing to a harmful spiral in the body.9 Indeed, people with stress-related disorders like depression and PTSD tend to have a smaller hippocampus.10 All of this points to the im- portance of this brain area in resilience---another key skill in the current high-demand business world. These ﬁndings are just the beginning of the story. Neuroscientists have also shown that practicing mindfulness affects brain areas related to percep- tion, body awareness, pain tolerance, emotion regu- lation, introspection, complex thinking, and sense of self. While more research is needed to document these changes over time and to understand un- derlying mechanisms, the converging evidence is compelling. Mindfulness should no longer be considered a "nice to have" for executives. It's a "must have": a way to keep our brains healthy, to support self-regulation and effective decision-making capabilities, and to protect ourselves from toxic stress. It can be inte- grated into one's religious or spiritual life or practiced

                           32

Mindfulness Can Literally Change Your Brain

as a form of secular mental training. When we take a seat, take a breath, and commit to being mindful--- particularly when we gather with others who are do- ing the same---we have the potential to be changed.

How to Practice Mindfulness Throughout Your Work Day

By Rasmus Hougaard and Jacqueline Carter

                  37

Y ou probably know the feeling all too well: You arrive at the ofﬁce with a clear plan for the day, and then, in what feels like just a moment, you ﬁnd yourself on your way back home. Nine or ten hours have passed but you've accomplished only a few of your priorities. And, most likely, you can't even remember exactly what you did all day. If this sounds familiar, don't worry: You're not alone. Re- search shows that people spend nearly 47% of their waking hours thinking about something other than what they're doing.1 In other words, many of us oper- ate on autopilot.

                           39

Mindfulness

Add to this that we have entered what many people are calling the "attention economy." In the attention economy, the ability to maintain focus and concen- tration is every bit as important as technical or man- agement skills. And because leaders must be able to absorb and synthesize a growing ﬂood of information in order to make good decisions, they're hit particu- larly hard by this emerging trend. The good news is you can train your brain to focus better by incorporating mindfulness exercises throughout your day. Based on our experience with thousands of leaders in more than 250 organiza- tions, here are some guidelines for becoming a more focused and mindful leader. First, start off your day right. Researchers have found that we release the most stress hormones within minutes after waking.2 Why? Because think- ing of the day ahead triggers our ﬁght-or-ﬂight in- stinct and releases cortisol into our blood. Instead, try this: When you wake up, spend two minutes in

                          40

How to Practice Mindfulness Throughout Your Work Day

your bed simply noticing your breath. As thoughts about the day pop into your mind, let them go and return to your breath. Next, when you get to the ofﬁce, take 10 minutes at your desk or in your car to boost your brain with the following short mindfulness practice before you dive into activity. Close your eyes, relax, and sit upright. Place your full focus on your breath. Simply main- tain an ongoing ﬂow of attention on the experience of your breathing: Inhale, exhale; inhale, exhale. To help your focus stay on your breathing, count silently at each exhalation. Any time you ﬁnd your mind distracted, simply release the distraction by return- ing your focus to your breath. Most important, allow yourself to enjoy these minutes. Throughout the rest of the day, other people and competing urgencies will ﬁght for your attention. But for these 10 minutes, your attention is all your own. Once you ﬁnish this practice and get ready to start working, mindfulness can help increase your

                             41

Mindfulness

effectiveness. Two skills deﬁne a mindful mind: focus and awareness. Focus is the ability to concentrate on what you're doing in the moment, while awareness is the ability to recognize and release unnecessary dis- tractions as they arise. Understand that mindfulness is not just a sedentary practice; it is about developing a sharp, clear mind. And mindfulness in action is a great alternative to the illusory practice of multitasking. Mindful working means applying focus and awareness to everything you do from the moment you enter the ofﬁce. Focus on the task at hand, and recognize and release internal and external distractions as they arise. In this way, mindfulness helps increase effectiveness, decrease mistakes, and even enhance creativity. To better understand the power of focus and aware- ness, consider an afﬂiction that touches nearly all of us: email addiction. Emails have a way of seducing our attention and redirecting it to lower-priority tasks because completing small, quickly accomplished tasks releases dopamine, a pleasurable hormone, in

                           42

How to Practice Mindfulness Throughout Your Work Day

our brains. This release makes us addicted to email and compromises our concentration. Instead, ap- ply mindfulness when opening your inbox. Focus on what is important and maintain awareness of what is merely noise. To get a better start to your day, avoid checking your email ﬁrst thing in the morning. Do- ing so will help you sidestep an onslaught of distrac- tions and short-term problems during a time of day that holds the potential for exceptional focus and creativity. As the day moves on and the inevitable back-to- back meetings start, mindfulness can help you lead shorter, more effective meetings. To avoid entering a meeting with a wandering mind, take two minutes to practice mindfulness, which you can do en route. Even better, let the ﬁrst two minutes of the meeting be silent, allowing everybody to arrive both physically and mentally. Then, if possible, end the meeting ﬁve minutes before the hour to allow all participants a mindful transition to their next appointment.

                              43

Mindfulness

As the day progresses and your brain starts to tire, mindfulness can help you stay sharp and avoid poor decisions. After lunch, set a timer on your phone to ring every hour. When the timer rings, cease your current activity and do one minute of mindfulness practice. These mindful performance breaks will help keep you from resorting to autopilot and lapsing into action addiction. Finally, as the day comes to an end and you start your commute home, apply mindfulness. For at least 10 minutes of the commute, turn off your phone, shut off the radio, and simply be. Let go of any thoughts that arise. Attend to your breath. Doing so will allow you to let go of the stresses of the day so you can re- turn home and be fully present with your family. Mindfulness is not about living life in slow mo- tion. It's about enhancing focus and awareness both in work and in life. It's about stripping away dis- tractions and staying on track with both individual and organizational, goals. Take control of your own

Resilience for the Rest of Us

By Daniel Goleman

          47

T here are two ways to become more resilient: one by talking to yourself, the other by retrain- ing your brain. If you've suffered a major failure, take the sage advice given by psychologist Martin Seligman in the HBR article "Building Resilience" (April 2011). Talk to yourself. Give yourself a cognitive intervention, and counter defeatist thinking with an optimistic attitude. Challenge your downbeat thinking, and re- place it with a positive outlook. Fortunately, major failures come along rarely in life. But what about bouncing back from the more frequent annoying screwups, minor setbacks, and

                           49

Mindfulness

irritating upsets that are routine in any leader's life? Resilience is, again, the answer---but with a different ﬂavor. You need to retrain your brain. The brain has a very different mechanism for bouncing back from the cumulative toll of daily has- sles. And with a little effort, you can upgrade its abil- ity to snap back from life's downers. Whenever we get so upset that we say or do some- thing we later regret (and who doesn't now and then?), that's a sure sign that our amygdala---the brain's ra- dar for danger and the trigger for the ﬁght-or-ﬂight response---has hijacked the brain's executive centers in the prefrontal cortex. The neural key to resilience lies in how quickly we recover from that hijacked state. The circuitry that brings us back to full energy and focus after an amygdala hijack concentrates in the left side of our prefrontal area, says Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin. He's also found that when we're distressed, there's heightened activity on the right side of the prefrontal

                           50

Resilience for the Rest of Us

area. Each of us has a characteristic level of left/right activity that predicts our daily mood range---if we're tilted to the right, more upsets; if to the left, we're quicker to recover from distress of all kinds. To tackle this in the workplace, Davidson teamed with the CEO of a high-pressure, 24/7, biotech startup and meditation expert Jon Kabat-Zinn of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Kabat-Zinn offered the employees at the biotech out- ﬁt instruction in mindfulness, an attention-training method that teaches the brain to register anything happening in the present moment with full focus--- but without reacting. The instructions are simple:

1.  Find a quiet, private place where you can be undistracted for a few minutes. For instance, close your ofﬁce door and mute your phone.

2.  Sit comfortably, with your back straight but relaxed.

                            51

     Mindfulness

3.  Focus your awareness on your breath, staying attentive to the sensations of the inhalation and exhalation, and start again on the next breath.

4.  Do not judge your breathing or try to change it in any way.

5.  See anything else that comes to mind as a distraction---thoughts, sounds, whatever. Let them go and return your attention to your breath.

After eight weeks and an average of 30 minutes a day practicing mindfulness, the employees had shifted their ratio from tilted toward the stressed- out right side to leaning toward the resilient left side. What's more, they said they remembered what they loved about their work: They got in touch with what had brought them energy in the ﬁrst place. To get the full beneﬁt of mindfulness, a daily prac- tice of 20 to 30 minutes works best. Think of it like

                            52

Resilience for the Rest of Us

a mental exercise routine. It can be very helpful to have guided instructions, but the key is to ﬁnd a slot for the practice in your daily routine. (There are even instructions for using a long drive as your practice session.) Mindfulness has steadily been gaining credence among hard-nosed executives. There are centers where mindfulness instruction has been tailored to businesspeople, from tony resorts like Miraval Resort in Arizona to programs in mindful leadership at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Google University has been offering a course in mindfulness to employees for years. Might you beneﬁt from tuning up your brain's re- silience circuitry by learning to practice mindfulness? Among high-performing executives, the effects of stress can be subtle. My colleagues Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee suggest as a rough diagnostic of leadership stress asking yourself, "Do I have a vague sense of unease, restlessness, or the feeling that life

                            53

Mindfulness

is not great (a higher standard than 'good enough')?" A bit of mindfulness might put your mind at ease.

Emotional Agility How Eﬀective Leaders Manage Their Thoughts and Feelings

By Susan David and Christina Congleton

                 55

S ixteen thousand---that's how many words we speak, on average, each day. So imagine how many unspoken ones course through our minds. Most of them are not facts but evaluations and judgments entwined with emotions---some posi- tive and helpful (I've worked hard and I can ace this presentation; This issue is worth speaking up about; The new VP seems approachable), others negative and less so (He's purposely ignoring me; I'm going to make a fool of myself; I'm a fake). The prevailing wisdom says that difﬁcult thoughts and feelings have no place at the ofﬁce: Executives, and particularly leaders, should be either stoic or

                          57

Mindfulness

cheerful; they must project conﬁdence and damp down any negativity bubbling up inside them. But that goes against basic biology. All healthy human beings have an inner stream of thoughts and feelings that include criticism, doubt, and fear. That's just our minds doing the job they were designed to do: trying to anticipate and solve problems and avoid potential pitfalls. In our people-strategy consulting practice ad- vising companies around the world, we see leaders stumble not because they have undesirable thoughts and feelings---that's inevitable---but because they get hooked by them, like ﬁsh caught on a line. This hap- pens in one of two ways. They buy into the thoughts, treating them like facts (It was the same in my last job . . . I've been a failure my whole career), and avoid situations that evoke them (I'm not going to take on that new challenge). Or, usually at the behest of their supporters, they challenge the existence of the thoughts and try to rationalize them away (I shouldn't

                           58

Emotional Agility

have thoughts like this . . . I know I'm not a total fail- ure), and perhaps force themselves into similar situ- ations, even when those go against their core values and goals (Take on that new assignment---you've got to get over this). In either case, they are paying too much attention to their internal chatter and allowing it to sap important cognitive resources that could be put to better use. This is a common problem, often perpetuated by popular self-management strategies. We regularly see executives with recurring emotional challenges at work---anxiety about priorities, jealousy of others' success, fear of rejection, distress over perceived slights---who have devised techniques to "ﬁx" them: positive afﬁrmations, prioritized to-do lists, immer- sion in certain tasks. But when we ask how long the challenges have persisted, the answer might be 10 years, 20 years, or since childhood. Clearly, those techniques don't work---in fact, am- ple research shows that attempting to minimize or

                            59

Mindfulness

ignore thoughts and emotions serves only to amplify them. In a famous study led by the late Daniel Weg- ner, a Harvard professor, participants who were told to avoid thinking about white bears had trouble do- ing so; later, when the ban was lifted, they thought about white bears much more than the control group did. Anyone who has dreamed of chocolate cake and french fries while following a strict diet understands this phenomenon. Effective leaders don't buy into or try to suppress their inner experiences. Instead they approach them in a mindful, values-driven, and productive way--- developing what we call emotional agility. In our complex, fast-changing knowledge economy, this ability to manage one's thoughts and feelings is essential to business success. Numerous studies, from the University of London professor Frank Bond and others, show that emotional agility can help peo- ple alleviate stress, reduce errors, become more inno- vative, and improve job performance.

                          60

Emotional Agility

We've worked with leaders in various industries to build this critical skill, and here we offer four practices---adapted from Acceptance and Commit- ment Therapy (ACT), originally developed by the University of Nevada psychologist Steven C. Hayes--- that are designed to help you do the same: Recognize your patterns; label your thoughts and emotions; ac- cept them; and act on your values.

                  Fish on a line

Let's start with two case studies. Cynthia is a senior corporate lawyer with two young children. She used to feel intense guilt about missed opportunities--- both at the ofﬁce, where her peers worked 80 hours a week while she worked 50, and at home, where she was often too distracted or tired to fully engage with her husband and children. One nagging voice in her head told her she'd have to be a better employee or

                           61

Mindfulness

risk career failure; another told her to be a better mother or risk neglecting her family. Cynthia wished that at least one of the voices would shut up. But neither would, and in response she failed to put up her hand for exciting new prospects at the ofﬁce and compulsively checked messages on her phone during family dinners. Jeffrey, a rising-star executive at a leading con- sumer goods company, had a different problem. Intel- ligent, talented, and ambitious, he was often angry--- at bosses who disregarded his views, subordinates who didn't follow orders, or colleagues who didn't pull their weight. He had lost his temper several times at work and been warned to get it under control. But when he tried, he felt that he was shutting off a core part of his personality, and he became even angrier and more upset. These smart, successful leaders were hooked by their negative thoughts and emotions. Cynthia was absorbed by guilt; Jeffrey was exploding with anger.

                          62

Emotional Agility

Cynthia told the voices to go away; Jeffrey bottled his frustration. Both were trying to avoid the discomfort they felt. They were being controlled by their inner experience, attempting to control it, or switching between the two.

                Getting unhooked

Fortunately, both Cynthia and Jeffrey realized that they couldn't go on---at least not successfully and happily---without more-effective inner strategies. We coached them to adopt the four practices:

              Recognize your patterns

The ﬁrst step in developing emotional agility is to no- tice when you've been hooked by your thoughts and feelings. That's hard to do, but there are certain tell- tale signs. One is that your thinking becomes rigid

                            63

Mindfulness

and repetitive. For example, Cynthia began to see that her self-recriminations played like a broken record, repeating the same messages over and over again. Another is that the story your mind is telling seems old, like a rerun of some past experience. Jeffrey no- ticed that his attitude toward certain colleagues (He's incompetent; There's no way I'm letting anyone speak to me like that) was quite familiar. In fact, he had ex- perienced something similar in his previous job---and in the one before that. The source of trouble was not just Jeffrey's environment but his own patterns of thought and feeling. You have to realize that you're stuck before you can initiate change.

        Label your thoughts and emotions

When you're hooked, the attention you give your thoughts and feelings crowds your mind; there's no room to examine them. One strategy that may help you consider your situation more objectively is

                          64

Emotional Agility

the simple act of labeling. Just as you call a spade a spade, call a thought a thought and an emotion an emotion. I'm not doing enough at work or at home becomes I'm having the thought that I'm not doing enough at work or at home. Similarly, My coworker is wrong---he makes me so angry becomes I'm having the thought that my coworker is wrong, and I'm feel- ing anger. Labeling allows you to see your thoughts and feelings for what they are: transient sources of data that may or may not prove helpful. Humans are psychologically able to take this helicopter view of private experiences, and mounting scientiﬁc evi- dence shows that simple, straightforward mindful- ness practice like this not only improves behavior and well-being but also promotes beneﬁcial biologi- cal changes in the brain and at the cellular level. As Cynthia started to slow down and label her thoughts, the criticisms that had once pressed in on her like a dense fog became more like clouds passing through a blue sky.

                           65

Mindfulness

                    Accept them

The opposite of control is acceptance: not acting on every thought or resigning yourself to negativity but responding to your ideas and emotions with an open attitude, paying attention to them and letting your- self experience them. Take 10 deep breaths, and no- tice what's happening in the moment. This can bring relief, but it won't necessarily make you feel good. In fact, you may realize just how upset you really are. The important thing is to show yourself (and others) some compassion and examine the reality of the situ- ation. What's going on---both internally and exter- nally? When Jeffrey acknowledged and made room for his feelings of frustration and anger rather than rejecting them, quashing them, or taking them out on others, he began to notice their energetic quality. They were a signal that something important was at stake and that he needed to take productive action. Instead of yelling at people, he could make a clear

                          66

Emotional Agility

request of a colleague or move swiftly on a press- ing issue. The more Jeffrey accepted his anger and brought his curiosity to it, the more it seemed to sup- port rather than undermine his leadership.

                 Act on your values

When you unhook yourself from your difﬁcult thoughts and emotions, you expand your choices. You can decide to act in a way that aligns with your values. We encourage leaders to focus on the concept of workability: Is your response going to serve you and your organization in the long term as well as the short term? Will it help you steer others in a direc- tion that furthers your collective purpose? Are you taking a step toward being the leader you most want to be and living the life you most want to live? The mind's thought stream ﬂows endlessly, and emotions change like the weather, but values can be called on at any time, in any situation.

                            67

Mindfulness

                WHAT ARE YOUR VALUES?

This list is drawn from the Personal Values Card Sort (2001), developed by W. R. Miller, J. C'de Baca, D. B. Matthews, and P. L. Wilbourne, of the University of New Mexico. You can use it to quickly identify the val- ues you hold that might inform a challenging situation at work. When you next make a decision, ask yourself whether it is consistent with these values.

Accuracy Duty Justice Realism Achievement Family Knowledge Responsibility Authority Forgiveness Leisure Risk Autonomy Friendship Mastery Safety Caring Fun Moderation Self-knowledge Challenge Generosity Nonconformity Service Comfort Genuineness Openness Simplicity Compassion Growth Order Stability Contribution Health Passion Tolerance Cooperation Helpfulness Popularity Tradition Courtesy Honesty Power Wealth Creativity Humility Purpose Dependability Humor Rationality

                              68

Emotional Agility

When Cynthia considered her values, she recog- nized how deeply committed she was to both her family and her work. She loved being with her chil- dren, but she also cared passionately about the pur- suit of justice. Unhooked from her distracting and discouraging feelings of guilt, she resolved to be guided by her principles. She recognized how impor- tant it was to get home for dinner with her family ev- ery evening and to resist work interruptions during that time. But she also undertook to make a number of important business trips, some of which coincided with school events that she would have preferred to attend. Conﬁdent that her values---not solely her emotions---were guiding her, Cynthia ﬁnally found peace and fulﬁllment.

It's impossible to block out difﬁcult thoughts and emotions. Effective leaders are mindful of their in- ner experiences but not caught in them. They know

                           69

Mindfulness

how to free up their internal resources and commit to actions that align with their values. Developing emotional agility is no quick fix. Even those who, like Cynthia and Jeffrey, regularly practice the steps we've outlined here will often find themselves hooked. But over time, leaders who become increasingly adept at it are the ones most likely to thrive.

Don't Let Power Corrupt You

    By Dacher Keltner
           71

I n the behavioral research I've conducted over the past 20 years, I've uncovered a disturbing pattern: While people usually gain power through traits and actions that advance the interests of others, such as empathy, collaboration, openness, fairness, and shar- ing, when they start to feel powerful or enjoy a po- sition of privilege, those qualities begin to fade. The powerful are more likely than other people to engage in rude, selﬁsh, and unethical behavior. The 19th- century historian and politician Lord Acton got it right: Power does tend to corrupt. I call this phenomenon "the power paradox," and I've studied it in numerous settings: colleges, the U.S.

                          73

Mindfulness

Senate, pro sports teams, and a variety of other pro- fessional workplaces. In each I've observed that peo- ple rise on the basis of their good qualities, but their behavior grows increasingly worse as they move up the ladder. This shift can happen surprisingly quickly. In one of my experiments, known as "the cookie monster" study, I brought people into a lab in groups of three, randomly assigned one to a position of lead- ership, and then gave them a group writing task. A half hour into their work, I placed a plate of freshly baked cookies---one for each team member, plus an extra---in front of everyone. In all groups each person took one and, out of politeness, left the extra cookie. The question was: Who would take a second treat, knowing that it would deprive others of the same? It was nearly always the person who'd been named the leader. In addition, the leaders were more likely to eat with their mouths open, lips smacking, and crumbs falling onto their clothes.

Studies show that wealth and credentials can have a similar effect. In another experiment, Paul Piff of UC Irvine and I found that whereas drivers of the least expensive vehicles---Dodge Colts, Plymouth Sat- ellites---always ceded the right-of-way to pedestrians in a crosswalk, people driving luxury cars such as BMWs and Mercedes yielded only 54% of the time; nearly half the time they ignored the pedestrian and the law. Surveys of employees in 27 countries have revealed that wealthy individuals are more likely to say it's acceptable to engage in unethical behavior, such as taking bribes or cheating on taxes. And re- cent research led by Danny Miller at HEC Montréal demonstrated that CEOs with MBAs are more likely than those without MBAs to engage in self-serving behavior that increases their personal compensation but causes their companies' value to decline. These ﬁndings suggest that iconic abuses of power ---Jeffrey Skilling's fraudulent accounting at Enron,

                            75

Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski's illegal bonuses, Silvio Berlusconi's bunga bunga parties, Leona Helmsley's tax evasion---are extreme examples of the kinds of misbehavior to which all leaders, at any level, are sus- ceptible. Studies show that people in positions of cor- porate power are three times as likely as those at the lower rungs of the ladder to interrupt coworkers, multitask during meetings, raise their voices, and say insulting things at the ofﬁce. And people who've just moved into senior roles are particularly vulnerable to losing their virtues, my research and other studies indicate. The consequences can be far-reaching. The abuse of power ultimately tarnishes the reputations of ex- ecutives, undermining their opportunities for inﬂu- ence. It also creates stress and anxiety among their colleagues, diminishing rigor and creativity in the group and dragging down team members' engage- ment and performance. In a recent poll of 800 man- agers and employees in 17 industries, about half the

                          76

Don't Let Power Corrupt You

respondents who reported being treated rudely at work said they deliberately decreased their effort or lowered the quality of their work in response. So how can you avoid succumbing to the power paradox? Through awareness and action.

             A need for reﬂection

A ﬁrst step is developing greater self-awareness. When you take on a senior role, you need to be atten- tive to the feelings that accompany your newfound power and to any changes in your behavior. My re- search has shown that power puts us into some- thing like a manic state, making us feel expansive, energized, omnipotent, hungry for rewards, and immune to risk---which opens us up to rash, rude, and unethical actions. But new studies in neurosci- ence ﬁnd that simply by reﬂecting on those thoughts and emotions---"Hey, I'm feeling as if I should rule

                            77

Mindfulness

the world right now"---we can engage regions of our frontal lobes that help us keep our worst impulses in check. When we recognize and label feelings of joy and conﬁdence, we're less likely to make irrational decisions inspired by them. When we acknowledge feelings of frustration (perhaps because subordinates aren't behaving the way we want), we're less likely to respond in adversarial or confrontational ways. You can build this kind of self-awareness through everyday mindfulness practices. One approach starts with sitting in a comfortable and quiet place, breath- ing deeply, and concentrating on the feeling of inhal- ing and exhaling, physical sensations, or sounds or sights in your environment. Studies show that spend- ing just a few minutes a day on such exercises gives people greater focus and calm, and for that reason techniques for them are now taught in training pro- grams at companies like Google, Facebook, Aetna, General Mills, Ford, and Goldman Sachs.

                          78

Don't Let Power Corrupt You

It's also important to reﬂect on your demeanor and actions. Are you interrupting people? Do you check your phone when others are talking? Have you told a joke or story that embarrassed or humiliated some- one else? Do you swear at the ofﬁce? Have you ever taken sole credit for a group effort? Do you forget col- leagues' names? Are you spending a lot more money than in the past or taking unusual physical risks? If you answered yes to at least a few of these ques- tions, take it as an early warning sign that you're be- ing tempted into problematic, arrogant displays of power. What may seem innocuous to you probably doesn't to your subordinates. Consider a story I re- cently heard about a needlessly hierarchical lunch delivery protocol on a cable television writing team. Each day when the team's sandwiches arrived, they were doled out to the writers in order of seniority. In failing to correct this behavior, the group's leaders were almost certainly diminishing its collaborative

                            79

Mindfulness

and creative potential. For a contrast, consider U.S. military mess halls, where the practice is the reverse, as the ethnographer and author Simon Sinek notes in the title of his most recent book, Leaders Eat Last. Ofﬁcers adhere to the policy not to cede authority but to show respect for their troops.

            Practicing graciousness

Whether you've already begun to succumb to the power paradox or not, you must work to remember and repeat the virtuous behaviors that helped you rise in the ﬁrst place. When teaching executives and others in positions of power, I focus on three essential practices---empathy, gratitude, and generosity---that have been shown to sustain benevolent leadership, even in the most cutthroat environments. For example, Leanne ten Brinke, Chris Liu, Sa- meer Srivastava, and I found that U.S. senators who

                          80

Don't Let Power Corrupt You

used empathetic facial expressions and tones of voice when speaking to the ﬂoor got more bills passed than those who used domineering, threatening ges- tures and tones in their speeches. Research by Anita Woolley of Carnegie Mellon and Thomas Malone of MIT has likewise shown that when teammates sub- tly signal understanding, engagement, interest, and concern for one another, the team is more effective at tackling hard analytical problems. Small expressions of gratitude also yield positive results. Studies show that romantic partners who acknowledge each other's value in casual conversa- tion are less likely to break up, that students who re- ceive a pat on the back from their teachers are more likely to take on difﬁcult problems, and that people who express appreciation to others in a newly formed group feel stronger ties to the group months later. Adam Grant of Wharton has found that when man- agers take the time to thank their employees, those workers are more engaged and productive. And my

                            81

Mindfulness

own research on NBA teams with Michael Kraus of Yale University shows that players who physically display their appreciation---through head raps, bear hugs, and hip and chest bumps---inspire their team- mates to play better and win nearly two more games per season (which is both statistically signiﬁcant and often the difference between making the play-offs and not). Simple acts of generosity can be equally power- ful. Studies show that individuals who share with others in a group---for example, by contributing new ideas or directly assisting on projects not their own---are deemed more worthy of respect and inﬂu- ence and more suitable for leadership. Mike Norton at Harvard Business School has found that when organizations provide an opportunity to donate to charities at work, employees feel more satisﬁed and productive. It might seem difﬁcult to constantly follow the ethics of "good power" when you're the boss and

                          82

Don't Let Power Corrupt You

responsible for making sure things get done. Not so. Your capacity for empathy, gratitude, and generosity can be cultivated by engaging in simple social behav- iors whenever the opportunity presents itself: a team meeting, a client pitch or negotiation, a 360-degree feedback session. Here are a few suggestions.

               To practice empathy:

• Ask a great question or two in every interaction, and paraphrase important points that others make.

• Listen with gusto. Orient your body and eyes toward the person speaking, and convey inter- est and engagement vocally.

• When someone comes to you with a problem, signal concern with phrases such as "I'm sorry" and "That's really tough." Avoid rushing to judgment and advice.

                           83

Mindfulness

• Before meetings, take a moment to think about the person you'll be with and what is happening in his or her life.

Arturo Bejar, Facebook's director of engineering, is one executive I've seen make empathy a priority as he guides his teams of designers, coders, data specialists, and writers. Watching him at work, I've noticed that his meetings all tend to be structured around a cas- cade of open-ended questions and that he never fails to listen thoughtfully. He leans toward whoever is speaking and carefully writes down everyone's ideas on a notepad. These small expressions of empathy signal to his team that he understands their concerns and wants them to succeed together.

                To practice gratitude:

• Make thoughtful thank-yous a part of how you communicate with others.

                               84

Don't Let Power Corrupt You

• Send colleagues speciﬁc and timely emails or notes of appreciation for jobs done well.

• Publicly acknowledge the value that each person contributes to your team, including the support staff.

• Use the right kind of touch---pats on the back, ﬁst bumps, or high ﬁves---to celebrate successes.

When Douglas Conant was CEO of the Campbell Soup Company, he emphasized a culture of gratitude across the organization. Each day he and his execu- tive assistants would spend up to an hour scanning his email and the company intranet for news of em- ployees who were "making a difference." Conant would then personally thank them---everyone from senior executives to maintenance people---for their contributions, usually with handwritten notes. He estimates that he wrote at least 10 a day, for a total

                              85

Mindfulness

of about 30,000 during his decade-long tenure, and says he would often ﬁnd them pinned up in employees' workspaces. Leaders I've taught have shared other tactics: giving small gifts to employees, taking them out to nice lunches or dinners, hosting employee-of-the-month celebrations, and setting up real or virtual "gratitude walls," on which coworkers can thank one another for speciﬁc contributions.

               To practice generosity:

• Seek opportunities to spend a little one-on-one time with the people you lead.

• Delegate some important and high-proﬁle responsibilities.

• Give praise generously.

• Share the limelight. Give credit to all who contribute to the success of your team and your organization.

                             86

Don't Let Power Corrupt You

Pixar director Pete Docter is a master of this last practice. When I ﬁrst started working with him on the movie Inside Out, I was curious about a cine- matic marvel he'd created ﬁve years before: the montage at the start of the ﬁlm Up, which shows the protagonist, Carl, meeting and falling in love with a girl, Ellie; enjoying a long married life with her; and then watching her succumb to illness. When I asked how he'd accomplished it, his answer was an exhaus- tive list of the 250 writers, animators, actors, story artists, designers, sculptors, editors, programmers, and computer modelers who had worked on it with him. When people ask about the box-ofﬁce success of Inside Out, he gives a similar response. Another Facebook executive I've worked with, product man- ager Kelly Winters, shares credit in a similar way. When she does PowerPoint presentations or talks to reporters about the success of her Compassion team, she always lists or talks about the data analysts, en- gineers, and content specialists who made it happen.

                            87

Mindfulness

You can outsmart the power paradox by practicing the ethics of empathy, gratitude, and generosity. It will bring out the best work and collaborative spirit of those around you. And you, too, will beneﬁt, with a burnished reputation, long-lasting leadership, and the dopamine-rich delights of advancing the interests of others.

Mindfulness for People Who Are Too Busy to Meditate

    By Maria Gonzalez
           89

M indfulness has become almost a buzzword. But what is it, really? Quite simply, mind- fulness is being present and aware, moment by moment, regardless of circumstances. For instance, researchers have found that practic- ing mindfulness can reprogram the brain to be more rational and less emotional. When faced with a deci- sion, meditators who practiced mindfulness showed increased activity in the posterior insula of the brain, an area linked to rational decision making. This al- lowed them to make decisions based more on fact than emotion. This is good news since other research has found that reasoning is actually suffused with emotion---the two are inseparable. What's more, our

                          91

Mindfulness

positive and negative feelings about people, things, and ideas arise much more rapidly than our con- scious thoughts---in a matter of milliseconds. We push threatening information away and hold friendly information close. We apply ﬁght-or-ﬂight reﬂexes not only to predators, but also to data itself. There are speciﬁc techniques that you can practice to help you reap the beneﬁts of mindfulness. You may have heard about a mindfulness-enhancing tech- nique where you meditate for a period of time before going about the rest of your day. This is deﬁnitely valuable. But I prefer practicing mindfulness all day, in every circumstance. In essence, you start living all of life mindfully, and over time there is no distinction between your formal mindfulness practice and mak- ing a presentation, negotiating a deal, driving your car, working out, or playing a round of golf. Try a technique I call "micro meditations." These are meditations that can be done several times a day for one to three minutes at a time. Periodically

                           92

Mindfulness for People Who Are Too Busy to Meditate

throughout the day, become aware of your breath. It could be when you feel yourself getting stressed or overwhelmed, with too much to do and too little time, or perhaps when you notice yourself becoming increasingly distracted and agitated. First, notice the quality of your breathing. Is it shallow or deep? Are you holding your breath and in so doing perhaps also holding your stomach? Are you hunching your shoulders? Next, start breathing so that you are bringing the breath into the belly. Do not strain. If this feels too unnatural, then try bringing the breath down into the lower chest. If the mind wanders, gently come back to the breath---without judging yourself for momen- tarily losing focus. You will notice that by regularly practicing this micro meditation you will become more aware and calmer. You'll ﬁnd yourself to be increasingly mind- ful, calm, and focused. It's helpful to create reminders for yourself to practice these meditations throughout

                              93

Mindfulness

the day. You can do them two to four times a day, every hour, before you go to a meeting, or whenever you feel like multitasking is eroding your concen- tration---whatever is feasible and feels right to you. Micro meditations can put you back on track and help you develop your mindfulness muscle. A second technique I use is one I call "mindful- ness in action." Instead of adding a new routine to your day, just experience your day a little differently by paying attention in a particular way, for seconds at a time. For instance, if you've ever been in a meeting and suddenly noticed that you missed what was just said because you were "somewhere else" for the last few minutes, chances are you weren't being mindful. Maybe you were thinking about your next meeting, everything on your to do list, or an incoming text. Or perhaps you just zoned out. This is incredibly com- mon. Unfortunately, not being present in this way can cause misunderstandings, missed opportunities, and wasted time.

                          94

Mindfulness for People Who Are Too Busy to Meditate

The next time you're in a meeting, try to do noth- ing but listen for seconds at a time. This is harder than it sounds, but with practice you will be able to listen continuously, without a break in concentration. Whenever you notice that your mind has wandered, come right back to listening to the voice of the per- son who is speaking. You may have to redirect your attention dozens of times in a single meeting---it's ex- tremely common. Always bring yourself back gently and with patience. You are training the mind to be right here, right now. These techniques can, as I've said, rewire the brain. As a result, three critical things happen. First, your ability to concentrate increases. Second, you see things with increasing clarity, which improves your judgment. And third, you develop equanimity. Equa- nimity enables you to reduce your physiological and emotional stress and enhances the likelihood that you will be able to ﬁnd creative solutions to problems. Practicing mindfulness---and reaping its beneﬁts--- doesn't have to be a big time commitment or require

                              95

Mindfulness

special training. You can start right now---in this moment.

Is Something Lost When We Use Mindfulness as a Productivity Tool?

    By Charlotte Lieberman
             97

I came to mindfulness as a healing practice after overcoming an addiction to the drug Adderall dur- ing my junior year of college. I found myself in this situation because I thought that using Adderall to help me focus was no big deal---an attitude shared by 81% of students nationwide.1 Adderall simply seemed like an innocuous short- cut to getting things done efﬁciently and effortlessly. I still remember the rush I felt my ﬁrst night on Ad- derall: I completed every page of assigned Faulkner reading (not easy), started and ﬁnished a paper sev- eral weeks before the due date (because why not?), Swiffered my room (twice), and answered all of my unread emails (even the irrelevant ones). It's also

                          99

Mindfulness

worth noting that I had forgotten to eat all night and somehow found myself still awake at 4 a.m., my jaw clenched and my stomach rumbling. Sleep was no- where in sight. What I saw initially as a shortcut to more focus and productivity ultimately turned out instead to be a long detour toward self-destruction. Rather than thinking of focus as the by-product of my own power and capability, I looked outside of myself, thinking that a pill would solve my problems. Long story short, I eventually came to grips with my problem, got off the drug, and found an antidote to my crippling self-doubt: meditation---particularly, mindfulness (or Vipassana) meditation. So to me, it's somewhat ironic that mindfulness has taken the media by storm precisely because of its sci- entiﬁcally proven beneﬁts for focus and productivity.2 And it's not just because I came to mindfulness as a way of healing from the fallout of the amount of pressure I put on myself to be productive. While

                         100

Is Something Lost When We Use Mindfulness as a Productivity Tool?

mindfulness is not a little blue pill, it's starting to be thought of as a kind of shortcut to focus and produc- tivity, not unlike a morning coffee. A wisdom tradi- tion associated with personal growth and insight is now being absorbed by our culture as a tool for career development and efﬁciency. But should mindfulness really be used to attain a particular goal? Is it OK to think of a practice that's all about "being" as just an- other tool for "doing"? Companies seem to think so. Given the mindful- ness buzz, it's no surprise that corporate mindfulness programs are proliferating across the country. Google offers "Search Inside Yourself " classes that teach mindfulness meditation at work. As celebrated in the recent book Mindful Work by David Gelles, corpo- rations like Goldman Sachs, HBO, Deutsche Bank, Target, and Bank of America tout the productivity- related beneﬁts of meditation to their employees. The world of professional athletics---most re- cently the NFL---too has drawn attention to the

                              101

Mindfulness

achievement-oriented underpinnings of the main- stream mindfulness movement. The 2015 Wall Street Journal article that explored the Seattle Seahawks' success in the 2014 Super Bowl explained that the team's secret weapon was its willingness to work with a sports psychologist who teaches mindfulness. Sea- hawks assistant head coach Tom Cable went so far as to describe the team as "incredibly mindful." This article was written in January, a month before the Seahawks lost the 2015 Super Bowl. In the wake of their defeat, I heard several conversations among acquaintances and family members (all of whom were sports fans and were nonmeditating but aware of meditation) in which they expressed skepticism about the power of meditation for focus and success. I mean, how much can we embrace mindfulness as a tool for success if a team famous for meditating lost the Super Bowl? Still a lot, I think. And I'm ﬁne stopping here to admit (if you haven't already concluded yourself ) that

                         102

Is Something Lost When We Use Mindfulness as a Productivity Tool?

the commodiﬁcation of mindfulness as a productiv- ity tool leaves me with a strange taste in my mouth. Above all, I am resistant to the teleological attitude toward meditation: that it's a "tool" designed for a particular purpose, contingent on "results." And yet asserting this skepticism brings me back to a conversation I had with my vegan cousin a few years ago. He is a PhD student in biological anthro- pology, an animal activist, and a longtime vegan. When I asked him if he was irked by all the celebri- ties going vegan to lose weight, he shook his head vig- orously. "I'd rather have people do the right thing for the wrong reason than not do the right thing at all," he explained (the "right" thing here being veganism). This philosophy seems applicable to the mind- fulness craze (aka "McMindfulness") too. I'm happy more people are getting the myriad beneﬁts of medi- tation. I am glad that you're no longer thought of as a patchouli-scented hippie if you're an avid medita- tor. If corporate mindfulness programs mean that

                              103

Mindfulness

employee self-care is more valued in the workplace, then so be it. But I also think there's room to consider an alter- native way of talking about meditation, especially when it comes to how we relate to our work. Looking at mindfulness as a tool for accomplish- ing what we need to get done keeps us trapped in a future-oriented mindset, rather than encouraging us to dilate the present moment. Of course, this doesn't invalidate the neuroscience; mindfulness helps us get more stuff done. But what about allowing mindful- ness to just be? To have the effects it is going to have, without attaching a marketing pitch to this ancient practice? Psychologist Kristin Neff is renowned for coining the term "self-compassion." In particular, Neff has as- serted that the ﬁrst component of self-compassion is kindness, the ability to shrug off those times when we "let ourselves down," when we don't get to check off

                          104

Is Something Lost When We Use Mindfulness as a Productivity Tool?

everything from our to do lists. The other two com- ponents of self-compassion are awareness and mind- fulness. The goal is not to get more done but to un- derstand that we are enough---and that our worth is not contingent on what we get done. (Although stud- ies have shown that self-forgiveness actually helps us procrastinate less.3) I'm not an idealist. I'm not saying everyone should start "Om-ing," devoting themselves solely to self- compassion, and forgetting all about their to do lists. But I am saying that compassion, and self- compassion, ought to move into the foreground as we talk about mindfulness---even in corporate mindful- ness programs. There's no shame in wanting to be productive at work. But there's also no shame in being able to cut yourself some slack, to extend yourself some love during those times at work when things don't feel so great.

There Are Risks to Mindfulness at Work

    By David Brendel
          107

M indfulness is close to taking on cult sta- tus in the business world. But as with any rapidly growing movement---regardless of its potential beneﬁts---there is good reason here for caution. Championed for many years by pioneering re- searchers such as Ellen Langer and Jon Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness is a mental orientation and set of strat- egies for focusing one's mind on here-and-now ex- periences, such as abdominal muscle movements during respiration or the chirping of birds outside one's window. It is rooted in ancient Eastern philoso- phies, such as Taoism and Buddhism. Contempo- rary empirical research demonstrates its beneﬁts for

                          109

Mindfulness

reducing anxiety and mental stress.1 A recent study suggested that it might cut the risk of stroke and heart attack as well. Mindful meditation and related practices are now widely accepted. For example, the New Republic pub- lished an article entitled "How 2014 Became the Year of Mindfulness." Mindfulness has also recently been featured on CBS's 60 Minutes and been lauded by the Hufﬁngton Post. Dan Harris, a well-known ABC News correspondent, has published a best-selling book called Ten Percent Happier, which describes his journey to discovering mindful meditation as an op- timal way to manage his very publicly shared anxiety disorder. There is increasing interest in how mindful- ness can be applied in clinical medicine and psychol- ogy, and some large insurance companies are even beginning to consider providing coverage for mind- fulness strategies for certain patients. As an executive coach and physician, I often sing the praises of mindfulness practices and recommend

                           110

There Are Risks to Mindfulness at Work

them to clients to manage stress, avoid burnout, en- hance leadership capacity, and steady the mind when in the midst of making important business decisions, career transitions, and personal life changes. Draw- ing on concepts from Eastern philosophies and re- search evidence from contemporary neuroscience, I help some clients employ controlled breathing and similar strategies in our sessions and in their every- day lives.2 I also refer clients to trusted colleagues who teach yoga and mindful meditation in greater depth than I can provide in my coaching sessions. But my growing knowledge of (and enthusiasm for) mindfulness is now tempered by a concern about its potential excesses and the risk that it may be crowding out other equally important models and strategies for managing stress, achieving peak perfor- mance, and reaching professional and personal ful- ﬁllment. At times, it appears that we are witnessing the development of a "cult of mindfulness" that, if not appropriately recognized and moderated, may result

                            111

Mindfulness

in an unfortunate backlash against it. Here are a cou- ple of my concerns.

               The avoidance risk

Some people use mindfulness strategies to avoid critical thinking tasks. I've worked with clients who, instead of rationally thinking through a career chal- lenge or ethical dilemma, prefer to disconnect from their challenges and retreat into a meditative mind- set. The issue here is that some problems require more thinking, not less. Sometimes stress is a signal that we need to consider our circumstances through greater self-reﬂective thought, not a "mindful" retreat to focused breathing or other immediate sensory ex- periences. Mindfulness strategies can prime the mind for sounder rational thinking---but the former clearly should not displace the latter. One of my clients spent so much time meditating and "mindfully" accepting

                         112

There Are Risks to Mindfulness at Work

her life "on its own terms" that she failed to confront underperforming workers (and discipline or ﬁre the worst offenders) in her company. After periods of meditating, she struggled to return to focused, task- oriented thinking. She required signiﬁcant reminders and reassurance from me that embracing Buddhist meditation does not entail tolerating substandard performance from her employees. Mindful medita- tion should always be used in the service of enhanc- ing, not displacing, people's rational and analytical thought processes about their careers and personal lives.

               The groupthink risk

As mindfulness practices enter mainstream Ameri- can life, some organizations and companies are admi- rably encouraging their people to make use of them in the workplace.3 But I'm aware of situations where

                            113

Mindfulness

this new orientation has gone too far. In one case, the director of a business unit in a ﬁnancial services corporation required his direct reports to participate several times per week in a 10- to 15-minute mindful- ness session that involved controlled breathing and guided imagery. Many participants came to dread the exercise. Some of them felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable, believing that mindfulness practices should be done in private. The very exercise that was supposed to reduce their work-related stress actually had increased it. The practice continued for weeks until several members of the group ﬁnally gathered the courage to tell the group leader that they would strongly prefer the daily exercises be optional, with impunity for nonparticipants. Mindfulness is rooted in a philosophy and psychology of self-efﬁcacy and proactive self-care. Imposing it on people in a top- down manner degrades the practice and the people who might beneﬁt from using it of their own volition.

There Are Risks to Mindfulness at Work

That mindfulness has emerged as a major cultural phenomenon on the contemporary American scene and in the business world in particular can be good news for people dealing with stress, burnout, and other realities of the modern workplace. But mindful- ness practices need to be incorporated as one among many self-chosen strategies for people aiming to cope with stress, think effectively, make sound deci- sions, and achieve fulﬁllment. Mindfulness practices should be used to enhance our rational and ethical thinking processes, not limit or displace them. And mindfulness practices should never be imposed on people, especially in the workplace. At its very core, mindfulness will be a huge step forward for Western culture if it stays focused on creating opportunities for individuals to discover their own personalized strategies for taming anxieties, managing stress, op- timizing work performance, and reaching happiness and fulﬁllment.

How Resilience Works

    By Diane Coutu
          1

W hen I began my career in journalism---I was a reporter at a national magazine in those days---there was a man I'll call Claus Schmidt. He was in his mid-ﬁfties, and to my impres- sionable eyes, he was the quintessential newsman: cynical at times, but unrelentingly curious and full of life, and often hilariously funny in a sandpaper-dry kind of way. He churned out hard-hitting cover sto- ries and features with a speed and elegance I could only dream of. It always astounded me that he was never promoted to managing editor. But people who knew Claus better than I did thought of him not just as a great newsman but as a

                          3

Resilience

quintessential survivor, someone who had endured in an environment often hostile to talent. He had lived through at least three major changes in the maga- zine's leadership, losing most of his best friends and colleagues on the way. At home, two of his children succumbed to incurable illnesses, and a third was killed in a trafﬁc accident. Despite all this---or maybe because of it---he milled around the newsroom day after day, mentoring the cub reporters, talking about the novels he was writing---always looking forward to what the future held for him. Why do some people suffer real hardships and not falter? Claus Schmidt could have reacted very differently. We've all seen that happen: One person cannot seem to get the conﬁdence back after a layoff; another, persistently depressed, takes a few years off from life after her divorce. The question we would all like answered is, Why? What exactly is that quality of resilience that carries people through life? It's a question that has fascinated me ever since I ﬁrst learned of the Holocaust survivors in elemen-

                           4

tary school. In college, and later in my studies as an afﬁliate scholar at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, I returned to the subject. For the past several months, however, I have looked on it with a new urgency, for it seems to me that the terrorism, war, and recession of recent months have made understanding resilience more important than ever. I have considered both the nature of individual resilience and what makes some organizations as a whole more resilient than others. Why do some people and some companies buckle under pressure? And what makes others bend and ultimately bounce back? My exploration has taught me much about re- silience, although it's a subject none of us will ever understand fully. Indeed, resilience is one of the great puzzles of human nature, like creativity or the religious instinct. But in sifting through psychological research and in reﬂecting on the many stories of resilience I've heard, I have seen a little more deeply into the hearts and minds of people like

                           5

Resilience

Claus Schmidt and, in doing so, looked more deeply into the human psyche as well.

           The buzz about resilience

Resilience is a hot topic in business these days. Not long ago, I was talking to a senior partner at a respected consulting ﬁrm about how to land the very best MBAs---the name of the game in that particular industry. The partner, Daniel Savageau (not his real name), ticked off a long list of qualities his ﬁrm sought in its hires: intelligence, ambition, integrity, analytic ability, and so on. "What about resilience?" I asked. "Well, that's very popular right now," he said. "It's the new buzzword. Candidates even tell us they're resilient; they volunteer the information. But frankly, they're just too young to know that about themselves. Resilience is something you realize you have after the fact."

                            6

How Resilience Works

"But if you could, would you test for it?" I asked. "Does it matter in business?" Savageau paused. He's a man in his late forties and a success personally and professionally. Yet it hadn't been a smooth ride to the top. He'd started his life as a poor French Canadian in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and had lost his father at six. He lucked into a football scholarship but was kicked out of Bos- ton University twice for drinking. He turned his life around in his twenties, married, divorced, remar- ried, and raised ﬁve children. Along the way, he made and lost two fortunes before helping to found the consulting ﬁrm he now runs. "Yes, it does matter," he said at last. "In fact, it probably matters more than any of the usual things we look for." In the course of reporting this article, I heard the same assertion time and again. As Dean Becker, the president and CEO of Adaptiv Learning Systems, a four-year-old com- pany in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, that devel- ops and delivers programs about resilience training,

                           7

Resilience

puts it: "More than education, more than experience, more than training, a person's level of resilience will determine who succeeds and who fails. That's true in the cancer ward, it's true in the Olympics, and it's true in the boardroom." Academic research into resilience started about 40 years ago with pioneering studies by Norman Garmezy, now a professor emeritus at the Univer- sity of Minnesota in Minneapolis. After studying why many children of schizophrenic parents did not suffer psychological illness as a result of growing up with them, he concluded that a certain quality of re- silience played a greater role in mental health than anyone had previously suspected. Today, theories abound about what makes resil- ience. Looking at Holocaust victims, Maurice Vander- pol, a former president of the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, found that many of the healthy survivors of concentration camps had what he calls a "plastic shield." The shield was comprised of several

                           8

How Resilience Works

factors, including a sense of humor. Often the humor was black, but nonetheless it provided a critical sense of perspective. Other core characteristics that helped included the ability to form attachments to others and the possession of an inner psychological space that protected the survivors from the intrusions of abusive others. Research about other groups uncovered dif- ferent qualities associated with resilience. The Search Institute, a Minneapolis-based nonproﬁt organiza- tion that focuses on resilience and youth, found that the more resilient kids have an uncanny ability to get adults to help them out. Still other research showed that resilient inner-city youth often have talents such as athletic abilities that attract others to them. Many of the early theories about resilience stressed the role of genetics. Some people are just born resil- ient, so the arguments went. There's some truth to that, of course, but an increasing body of empirical evidence shows that resilience---whether in children, survivors of concentration camps, or businesses back

                            9

Resilience

from the brink---can be learned. For example, George Vaillant, the director of the Study of Adult Develop- ment at Harvard Medical School in Boston, observes that within various groups studied during a 60-year period, some people became markedly more resil- ient over their lifetimes. Other psychologists claim that unresilient people more easily develop resiliency skills than those with head starts. Most of the resilience theories I encountered in my research make good common sense. But I also observed that almost all the theories overlap in three ways. Resilient people, they posit, possess three char- acteristics: a staunch acceptance of reality; a deep be- lief, often buttressed by strongly held values, that life is meaningful; and an uncanny ability to improvise. You can bounce back from hardship with just one or two of these qualities, but you will only be truly re- silient with all three. These three characteristics hold true for resilient organizations as well. Let's take a look at each of them in turn.

                           10

How Resilience Works

               Facing down reality

A common belief about resilience is that it stems from an optimistic nature. That's true but only as long as such optimism doesn't distort your sense of reality. In extremely adverse situations, rose-colored thinking can actually spell disaster. This point was made poi- gnantly to me by management researcher and writer Jim Collins, who happened upon this concept while researching Good to Great, his book on how compa- nies transform themselves out of mediocrity. Collins had a hunch (an exactly wrong hunch) that resilient companies were ﬁlled with optimistic people. He tried out that idea on Admiral Jim Stockdale, who was held prisoner and tortured by the Vietcong for eight years. Collins recalls: "I asked Stockdale: 'Who didn't make it out of the camps?' And he said, 'Oh, that's easy. It was the optimists. They were the ones who

                          11

Resilience

said we were going to be out by Christmas. And then they said we'd be out by Easter and then out by Fourth of July and out by Thanksgiving, and then it was Christmas again.' Then Stockdale turned to me and said, 'You know, I think they all died of broken hearts.'" In the business world, Collins found the same un- blinking attitude shared by executives at all the most successful companies he studied. Like Stockdale, resilient people have very sober and down-to-earth views of those parts of reality that matter for sur- vival. That's not to say that optimism doesn't have its place: In turning around a demoralized sales force, for instance, conjuring a sense of possibility can be a very powerful tool. But for bigger challenges, a cool, almost pessimistic, sense of reality is far more important. Perhaps you're asking yourself, "Do I truly under- stand---and accept---the reality of my situation? Does my organization?" Those are good questions, particu-

                          12

How Resilience Works

larly because research suggests most people slip into denial as a coping mechanism. Facing reality, really facing it, is grueling work. Indeed, it can be unpleas- ant and often emotionally wrenching. Consider the following story of organizational resilience, and see what it means to confront reality. Prior to September 11, 2001, Morgan Stanley, the famous investment bank, was the largest ten- ant in the World Trade Center. The company had some 2,700 employees working in the south tower on 22 ﬂoors between the 43rd and the 74th. On that horrible day, the ﬁrst plane hit the north tower at 8:46 a.m. and Morgan Stanley started evacuating just one minute later, at 8:47 a.m. When the second plane crashed into the south tower 15 minutes after that, Morgan Stanley's ofﬁces were largely empty. All told, the company lost only seven employees despite receiving an almost direct hit. Of course, the organization was just plain lucky to be in the second tower. Cantor Fitzgerald, whose

                          13

Resilience

ofﬁces were hit in the ﬁrst attack, couldn't have done anything to save its employees. Still, it was Morgan Stanley's hard-nosed realism that enabled the com- pany to beneﬁt from its luck. Soon after the 1993 at- tack on the World Trade Center, senior management recognized that working in such a symbolic center of U.S. commercial power made the company vulner- able to attention from terrorists and possible attack. With this grim realization, Morgan Stanley launched a program of preparedness at the micro level. Few companies take their ﬁre drills seriously. Not so Morgan Stanley, whose VP of security for the Individual Investor Group, Rick Rescorla, brought a military discipline to the job. Rescorla, himself a highly resilient, decorated Vietnam vet, made sure that people were fully drilled about what to do in a catastrophe. When disaster struck on September 11, Rescorla was on a bullhorn telling Morgan Stanley employees to stay calm and follow their well-practiced drill, even though some building supervisors were

                          14

How Resilience Works

telling occupants that all was well. Sadly, Rescorla himself, whose life story has been widely covered in recent months, was one of the seven who didn't make it out. "When you're in ﬁnancial services where so much depends on technology, contingency planning is a major part of your business," says President and COO Robert G. Scott. But Morgan Stanley was prepared for the very toughest reality. It had not just one but three recovery sites where employees could congre- gate and business could take place if work locales were ever disrupted. "Multiple backup sites seemed like an incredible extravagance on September 10," concedes Scott. "But on September 12, they seemed like genius." Maybe it was genius; it was undoubtedly resilience at work. The fact is, when we truly stare down reality, we prepare ourselves to act in ways that allow us to endure and survive extraordinary hardship. We train ourselves how to survive before the fact.

                          15

            The search for meaning

The ability to see reality is closely linked to the sec- ond building block of resilience, the propensity to make meaning of terrible times. We all know people who, under duress, throw up their hands and cry, "How can this be happening to me?" Such people see themselves as victims, and living through hardship carries no lessons for them. But resilient people de- vise constructs about their suffering to create some sort of meaning for themselves and others. I have a friend I'll call Jackie Oiseaux who suffered repeated psychoses over a 10-year period due to an undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Today, she holds down a big job in one of the top publishing companies in the country, has a family, and is a prominent mem- ber of her church community. When people ask her how she bounced back from her crises, she runs her hands through her hair. "People sometimes say, 'Why me?' But I've always said, 'Why not me?' True, I lost

                          16

How Resilience Works

many things during my illness," she says, "but I found many more---incredible friends who saw me through the bleakest times and who will give meaning to my life forever." This dynamic of meaning making is, most research- ers agree, the way resilient people build bridges from present-day hardships to a fuller, better-constructed future. Those bridges make the present manageable, for lack of a better word, removing the sense that the present is overwhelming. This concept was beauti- fully articulated by Viktor E. Frankl, an Austrian psy- chiatrist and an Auschwitz survivor. In the midst of staggering suffering, Frankl invented "meaning ther- apy," a humanistic therapy technique that helps indi- viduals make the kinds of decisions that will create signiﬁcance in their lives. In his book Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl described the pivotal moment in the camp when he developed meaning therapy. He was on his way to work one day, worrying whether he should trade his last cigarette for a bowl of soup. He wondered how

                              17

Resilience

he was going to work with a new foreman whom he knew to be particularly sadistic. Suddenly, he was disgusted by just how trivial and meaningless his life had become. He realized that to survive, he had to ﬁnd some purpose. Frankl did so by imagining him- self giving a lecture after the war on the psychology of the concentration camp, to help outsiders under- stand what he had been through. Although he wasn't even sure he would survive, Frankl created some con- crete goals for himself. In doing so, he succeeded in rising above the sufferings of the moment. As he put it in his book: "We must never forget that we may also ﬁnd meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed." Frankl's theory underlies most resilience coach- ing in business. Indeed, I was struck by how often businesspeople referred to his work. "Resilience training---what we call hardiness---is a way for us to help people construct meaning in their everyday lives," explains Salvatore R. Maddi, a University

                         18

of California, Irvine psychology professor and the director of the Hardiness Institute in Newport Beach, California. "When people realize the power of resilience training, they often say, 'Doc, is this what psychotherapy is?' But psychotherapy is for people whose lives have fallen apart badly and need repair. We see our work as showing people life skills and atti- tudes. Maybe those things should be taught at home, maybe they should be taught in schools, but they're not. So we end up doing it in business." Yet the challenge confronting resilience trainers is often more difﬁcult than we might imagine. Mean- ing can be elusive, and just because you found it once doesn't mean you'll keep it or ﬁnd it again. Con- sider Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who survived the war against the Nazis, imprisonment in the gulag, and cancer. Yet when he moved to a farm in peaceful, safe Vermont, he could not cope with the "infantile West." He was unable to discern any real meaning in what he felt to be the destructive and irresponsible free- dom of the West. Upset by his critics, he withdrew

                          19

Resilience

into his farmhouse, behind a locked fence, seldom to be seen in public. In 1994, a bitter man, Solzhenitsyn moved back to Russia. Since ﬁnding meaning in one's environment is such an important aspect of resilience, it should come as no surprise that the most successful organizations and people possess strong value systems. Strong val- ues infuse an environment with meaning because they offer ways to interpret and shape events. While it's popular these days to ridicule values, it's surely no coincidence that the most resilient organization in the world has been the Catholic Church, which has survived wars, corruption, and schism for more than 2,000 years, thanks largely to its immutable set of values. Businesses that survive also have their creeds, which give them purposes beyond just mak- ing money. Strikingly, many companies describe their value systems in religious terms. Pharmaceutical gi- ant Johnson & Johnson, for instance, calls its value system, set out in a document given to every new

                           20

How Resilience Works

employee at orientation, the Credo. Parcel company UPS talks constantly about its Noble Purpose. Value systems at resilient companies change very little over the years and are used as scaffolding in times of trouble. UPS Chairman and CEO Mike Es- kew believes that the Noble Purpose helped the com- pany to rally after the agonizing strike in 1997. Says Eskew: "It was a hugely difﬁcult time, like a family feud. Everyone had close friends on both sides of the fence, and it was tough for us to pick sides. But what saved us was our Noble Purpose. Whatever side peo- ple were on, they all shared a common set of values. Those values are core to us and never change; they frame most of our important decisions. Our strategy and our mission may change, but our values never do." The religious connotations of words like "credo," "values," and "noble purpose," however, should not be confused with the actual content of the values. Com- panies can hold ethically questionable values and still be very resilient. Consider Phillip Morris, which has

                          21

Resilience

demonstrated impressive resilience in the face of in- creasing unpopularity. As Jim Collins points out, Phil- lip Morris has very strong values, although we might not agree with them---for instance, the value of "adult choice." But there's no doubt that Phillip Morris exec- utives believe strongly in its values, and the strength of their beliefs sets the company apart from most of the other tobacco companies. In this context, it is worth noting that resilience is neither ethically good nor bad. It is merely the skill and the capacity to be ro- bust under conditions of enormous stress and change. As Viktor Frankl wrote: "On the average, only those prisoners could keep alive who, after years of trekking from camp to camp, had lost all scruples in their ﬁght for existence; they were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, even brutal . . . in order to save themselves. We who have come back . . . we know: The best of us did not return." Values, positive or negative, are actually more important for organizational resilience than hav-

                           22

How Resilience Works

ing resilient people on the payroll. If resilient em- ployees are all interpreting reality in different ways, their decisions and actions may well conﬂict, calling into doubt the survival of their organization. And as the weakness of an organization becomes apparent, highly resilient individuals are more likely to jettison the organization than to imperil their own survival.

              Ritualized ingenuity

The third building block of resilience is the ability to make do with whatever is at hand. Psychologists follow the lead of French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss in calling this skill bricolage.1 Intrigu- ingly, the roots of that word are closely tied to the concept of resilience, which literally means "bounc- ing back." Says Levi-Strauss: "In its old sense, the verb bricoler . . . was always used with reference to some extraneous movement: a ball rebounding, a dog

                           23

Resilience

straying, or a horse swerving from its direct course to avoid an obstacle." Bricolage in the modern sense can be deﬁned as a kind of inventiveness, an ability to improvise a solu- tion to a problem without proper or obvious tools or materials. Bricoleurs are always tinkering---building radios from household effects or ﬁxing their own cars. They make the most of what they have, put- ting objects to unfamiliar uses. In the concentration camps, for example, resilient inmates knew to pocket pieces of string or wire whenever they found them. The string or wire might later become useful---to ﬁx a pair of shoes, perhaps, which in freezing conditions might make the difference between life and death. When situations unravel, bricoleurs muddle through, imagining possibilities where others are confounded. I have two friends, whom I'll call Paul Shields and Mike Andrews, who were roommates throughout their college years. To no one's surprise, when they graduated, they set up a business to- gether selling educational materials to schools, busi-

                          24

How Resilience Works

nesses, and consulting ﬁrms. At ﬁrst, the company was a great success, making both founders paper millionaires. But the recession of the early 1990s hit the company hard, and many core clients fell away. At the same time, Paul experienced a bitter divorce and a depression that made it impossible for him to work. Mike offered to buy Paul out but was instead slapped with a lawsuit claiming that Mike was trying to steal the business. At this point, a less resilient per- son might have just walked away from the mess. Not Mike. As the case wound through the courts, he kept the company going any way he could---constantly morphing the business until he found a model that worked: going into joint ventures to sell English- language training materials to Russian and Chinese companies. Later, he branched off into publishing newsletters for clients. At one point, he was even writing video scripts for his competitors. Thanks to all this bricolage, by the time the lawsuit was settled in his favor, Mike had an entirely different, and much more solid, business than the one he had started with.

                            25

Resilience

Bricolage can be practiced on a higher level as well. Richard Feynman, winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize in physics, exempliﬁed what I like to think of as intellec- tual bricolage. Out of pure curiosity, Feynman made himself an expert on cracking safes, not only looking at the mechanics of safecracking but also cobbling to- gether psychological insights about people who used safes and set the locks. He cracked many of the safes at Los Alamos, for instance, because he guessed that theoretical physicists would not set the locks with random code numbers they might forget but would instead use a sequence with mathematical signiﬁ- cance. It turned out that the three safes containing all the secrets to the atomic bomb were set to the same mathematical constant, e, whose ﬁrst six digits are 2.71828. Resilient organizations are stuffed with bricoleurs, though not all of them, of course, are Richard Feyn- mans. Indeed, companies that survive regard improvi- sation as a core skill. Consider UPS, which empowers its drivers to do whatever it takes to deliver packages

                          26

How Resilience Works

on time. Says CEO Eskew: "We tell our employees to get the job done. If that means they need to impro- vise, they improvise. Otherwise we just couldn't do what we do every day. Just think what can go wrong: a busted trafﬁc light, a ﬂat tire, a bridge washed out. If a snowstorm hits Louisville tonight, a group of people will sit together and discuss how to handle the problem. Nobody tells them to do that. They come to- gether because it's our tradition to do so." That tradition meant that the company was deliv- ering parcels in southeast Florida just one day after Hurricane Andrew devastated the region in 1992, causing billions of dollars in damage. Many peo- ple were living in their cars because their homes had been destroyed, yet UPS drivers and managers sorted packages at a diversion site and made deliver- ies even to those who were stranded in their cars. It was largely UPS's improvisational skills that enabled it to keep functioning after the catastrophic hit. And the fact that the company continued on gave others a sense of purpose or meaning amid the chaos.

                           27

Resilience

Improvisation of the sort practiced by UPS, how- ever, is a far cry from unbridled creativity. Indeed, much like the military, UPS lives on rules and regula- tions. As Eskew says: "Drivers always put their keys in the same place. They close the doors the same way. They wear their uniforms the same way. We are a company of precision." He believes that although they may seem stiﬂing, UPS's rules were what allowed the company to bounce back immediately after Hurri- cane Andrew, for they enabled people to focus on the one or two ﬁxes they needed to make in order to keep going. Eskew's opinion is echoed by Karl E. Weick, a professor of organizational behavior at the Univer- sity of Michigan Business School in Ann Arbor and one of the most respected thinkers on organiza- tional psychology. "There is good evidence that when people are put under pressure, they regress to their most habituated ways of responding," Weick has writ- ten. "What we do not expect under life-threatening

                         28

How Resilience Works

pressure is creativity." In other words, the rules and regulations that make some companies appear less creative may actually make them more resilient in times of real turbulence.

Claus Schmidt, the newsman I mentioned earlier, died about ﬁve years ago, but I'm not sure I could have interviewed him about his own resilience even if he were alive. It would have felt strange, I think, to ask him, "Claus, did you really face down reality? Did you make meaning out of your hardships? Did you improvise your recovery after each professional and personal disaster?" He may not have been able to answer. In my experience, resilient people don't of- ten describe themselves that way. They shrug off their survival stories and very often assign them to luck. Obviously, luck does have a lot to do with surviv- ing. It was luck that Morgan Stanley was situated in the south tower and could put its preparedness

                            29

Resilience

training to work. But being lucky is not the same as being resilient. Resilience is a reﬂex---a way of facing and understanding the world---that is deeply etched into a person's mind and soul. Resilient people and companies face reality with staunchness, make meaning of hardship instead of crying out in despair, and improvise solutions from thin air. Others do not. This is the nature of resilience, and we will never completely understand it.

Resilience for the Rest of Us

     By Daniel Goleman
            31

T here are two ways to become more resilient: one by talking to yourself, the other by retrain- ing your brain. If you've suffered a major failure, take the sage advice given by psychologist Martin Seligman in the HBR article "Building Resilience" (April 2011). Talk to yourself. Give yourself a cognitive intervention, and counter defeatist thinking with an optimistic attitude. Challenge your downbeat thinking, and re- place it with a positive outlook. Fortunately, major failures come along rarely in life. But what about bouncing back from the more frequent annoying screwups, minor setbacks, and

                           33

Resilience

irritating upsets that are routine in any leader's life? Resilience is, again, the answer---but with a different ﬂavor. You need to retrain your brain. The brain has a very different mechanism for bouncing back from the cumulative toll of daily has- sles. And with a little effort, you can upgrade its abil- ity to snap back from life's downers. Whenever we get so upset that we say or do some- thing we later regret (and who doesn't now and then?), that's a sure sign that our amygdala---the brain's radar for danger and the trigger for the ﬁght- or-ﬂight response---has hijacked the brain's execu- tive centers in the prefrontal cortex. The neural key to resilience lies in how quickly we recover from that hijacked state. The circuitry that brings us back to full energy and focus after an amygdala hijack concentrates in the left side of our prefrontal area, says Richard David- son, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin. He's also found that when we're distressed, there's

                           34

Resilience for the Rest of Us

heightened activity on the right side of the prefrontal area. Each of us has a characteristic level of left/right activity that predicts our daily mood range---if we're tilted to the right, more upsets; if to the left, we're quicker to recover from distress of all kinds. To tackle this in the workplace, Davidson teamed with the CEO of a high-pressure, 24/7, biotech startup and meditation expert Jon Kabat-Zinn of the Univer- sity of Massachusetts Medical School. Kabat-Zinn offered the employees at the biotech outﬁt instruc- tion in mindfulness, an attention-training method that teaches the brain to register anything happening in the present moment with full focus---but without reacting. The instructions are simple:

1.  Find a quiet, private place where you can be undistracted for a few minutes. For instance, close your ofﬁce door and mute your phone.

                           35

     Resilience

2.  Sit comfortably, with your back straight but relaxed.

3.  Focus your awareness on your breath, staying attentive to the sensations of the inhalation and exhalation, and start again on the next breath.

4.  Do not judge your breathing or try to change it in any way.

5.  See anything else that comes to mind as a distraction---thoughts, sounds, whatever. Let them go and return your attention to your breath.

After eight weeks and an average of 30 minutes a day practicing mindfulness, the employees had shifted their ratio from tilted toward the stressed- out right side to leaning toward the resilient left side. What's more, they said they remembered what they loved about their work: They got in touch with what had brought them energy in the ﬁrst place.

                           36

Resilience for the Rest of Us

To get the full beneﬁt of mindfulness, a daily prac- tice of 20 to 30 minutes works best. Think of it like a mental exercise routine. It can be very helpful to have guided instructions, but the key is to ﬁnd a slot for the practice in your daily routine. (There are even instructions for using a long drive as your practice session.) Mindfulness has steadily been gaining credence among hard-nosed executives. There are centers where mindfulness instruction has been tailored to businesspeople, from tony resorts like Miraval Resort in Arizona to programs in mindful leadership at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Google University has been offering a course in mindfulness to employees for years. Might you beneﬁt from tuning up your brain's resilience circuitry by learning to practice mindful- ness? Among high-performing executives, the ef- fects of stress can be subtle. My colleagues Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee suggest as a rough diag- nostic of leadership stress asking yourself, "Do I have

                            37

Resilience

a vague sense of unease, restlessness, or the feeling that life is not great (a higher standard than 'good enough')?" A bit of mindfulness might put your mind at ease.

How to Evaluate, Manage, and Strengthen Your Resilience

     By David Kopans

T hink back to your last off-site meeting. You and the rest of your team likely poured over reports and spreadsheets, facts and ﬁgures. Strewn about the table were probably the tools of your trade: reams of data, balance sheets, and P&Ls. Managers understand that clear-eyed analysis---both quantitative and qualitative---is the key to building a resilient business. And yet when it comes to measur- ing and strengthening our own ability to adapt, grow, and prosper, rarely do we apply the same methodical approach. But we should. Based on my own experience start- ing, building, and growing companies, as well as

                         41

Resilience

upon decades of research showing the underlying components of personal resilience, I've discovered a few fundamental things you can do to actually evalu- ate, manage, and strengthen your own resilience in the same way that you would increase the resiliency of your company:

Build up your positivity currency. We can't just print resilience the way countries print money. Individu- als must use what I call a "positivity currency" ap- proach that is grounded in actual positive interac- tions, events, and memories---factors that are known to boost resilience. This currency is only "printed" and stored as assets when we focus on positive things and express gratitude for them. Why? Because main- taining a positive outlook and regularly expressing gratitude are the bullion bars that have real value in backstopping and building resilience. Research by Robert Emmons of UC Davis, Mi- chael McCullough of the University of Miami, and

                         42

How to Evaluate, Manage, and Strengthen Your Resilience

others clearly shows that they are among the most re- liable methods for increasing personal happiness and life satisfaction.1 Creating such positivity currency can decrease anxiety, reduce symptoms of illness, and improve the quality of your sleep. All of which, of course, lead to greater personal resilience.

Keep records. None of the tools we use to evalu- ate companies work very well without good record keeping. That's also true when it comes to building individual resilience. When you commit positive in- teractions, events, and memories to the written word, they register higher value than other non-written forms of positivity currency-based activity, accord- ing to research by positive psychology expert Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania.2 Record your positive currency transactions (by jotting them down in a leather bound journal or a digital equiva- lent). The data points you record could be as simple as keeping a written tally by category (such as family,

                              43

Resilience

friends, or work) in a paper notebook, entering the information into a spreadsheet, or assigning hashtags to items in a digital gratitude journal.

Create a bull market. Financial markets boom when increasing numbers of investors want in. Likewise, our own resilience grows when we encourage positiv- ity buyers to enter the market. It's not a difﬁcult task; positivity is socially contagious. In the research be- hind their book Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives, Harvard's Nicholas Christakis and the University of California, San Diego's James Fowler detail how hap- piness depends not just on our own choices and ac- tions, but also on those of people who are two or even three degrees removed from us. What this means is by being more positive ourselves, we encourage oth- ers to do the same, and this in turn creates a virtuous "reverse run on the bank" positive feedback loop, and

                           44

How to Evaluate, Manage, and Strengthen Your Resilience

our own resilience is increased and strengthened by the actions of others.

Take a portfolio approach. Resilient businesses diver- sify risk. Accordingly, resilient individuals diversify their positivity currency. They look to increase their overall resilience by evaluating what it is that provides the highest returns across their entire "life portfolio" and then investing more in those areas. Most fre- quently, these high-return assets come from our lives outside of the ofﬁce. Indeed, while we may spend the majority of waking hours at work, our job should not be central to our overall positive outlook. In a 2015 report entitled "The Happiness Study" from Black- hawk Engagement Solutions, respondents ranked their jobs eighth out of a list of 12 contributors to overall happiness. Ranking in the top spots were fam- ily, friends, health, hobbies, and community.3 It fol- lows that by generating more positivity currency in

                              45

Resilience

those areas, you will increase the ability to bring your best self to work.

Report regularly. Finally, just as regular review of a company's ﬁnancials is important to building a resil- ient business, building individual resilience requires regular review of positivity currency data. This review not only enables you to glean insights and take cor- rective actions, but also to boost your resilience by simply increasing your exposure to positive interac- tions and expressions of gratitude. As suggested in a famous 2014 experiment conducted by Facebook's data scientists and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, if your news feed skews positive, so will you.4 Even if you don't analyze your positivity currency data deeply like a Wall Street quant, just exposing yourself to it on a regular basis will make you more

                          46

How to Evaluate, Manage, and Strengthen Your Resilience

resilient. So ﬁnd a regular time to celebrate and re- ﬂect on your positivity currency (I do it while I wait for my morning coffee). Make it a habit, and your level of resilience---and that of your friends, family, and coworkers---will rise.

Find the Coaching in Criticism

By Sheila Heen and Douglas Stone

                49

F eedback is crucial. That's obvious: It improves performance, develops talent, aligns expecta- tions, solves problems, guides promotion and pay, and boosts the bottom line. But it's equally obvious that in many organizations, feedback doesn't work. A glance at the stats tells the story: Only 36% of managers complete appraisals thoroughly and on time. In one recent survey, 55% of employees said their most recent performance re- view had been unfair or inaccurate, and one in four said they dread such evaluations more than anything else in their working lives. When senior HR execu- tives were asked about their biggest performance management challenge, 63% cited managers' inability

                         51

Resilience

or unwillingness to have difﬁcult feedback discus- sions. Coaching and mentoring? Uneven at best. Most companies try to address these problems by training leaders to give feedback more effectively and more often. That's ﬁne as far as it goes; everyone beneﬁts when managers are better communicators. But improving the skills of the feedback giver won't accomplish much if the receiver isn't able to absorb what is said. It is the receiver who controls whether feedback is let in or kept out, who has to make sense of what he or she is hearing, and who decides whether or not to change. People need to stop treat- ing feedback only as something that must be pushed and instead improve their ability to pull. For the past 20 years we've coached executives on difﬁcult conversations, and we've found that almost everyone, from new hires to C-suite veterans, strug- gles with receiving feedback. A critical performance review, a well-intended suggestion, or an oblique comment that may or may not even be feedback

                          52

Find the Coaching in Criticism

("Well, your presentation was certainly interesting") can spark an emotional reaction, inject tension into the relationship, and bring communication to a halt. But there's good news, too: The skills needed to re- ceive feedback well are distinct and learnable. They include being able to identify and manage the emo- tions triggered by the feedback and extract value from criticism even when it's poorly delivered.

       Why feedback doesn’t register

What makes receiving feedback so hard? The pro- cess strikes at the tension between two core human needs---the need to learn and grow, and the need to be accepted just the way you are. As a result, even a seemingly benign suggestion can leave you feeling an- gry, anxious, badly treated, or profoundly threatened. A hedge such as "Don't take this personally" does nothing to soften the blow.

                            53

Resilience

Getting better at receiving feedback starts with understanding and managing those feelings. You might think there are a thousand ways in which feed- back can push your buttons, but in fact there are only three. Truth triggers are set off by the content of the feed- back. When assessments or advice seem off base, unhelpful, or simply untrue, you feel indignant, wronged, and exasperated. Relationship triggers are tripped by the person providing the feedback. Exchanges are often colored by what you believe about the giver (He's got no cred- ibility on this topic!) and how you feel about your previous interactions (After all I've done for you, I get this petty criticism?). So you might reject coaching that you would accept on its merits if it came from someone else. Identity triggers are all about your relationship with yourself. Whether the feedback is right or wrong, wise or witless, it can be devastating if it causes your

                           54

Find the Coaching in Criticism

sense of who you are to come undone. In such mo- ments you'll struggle with feeling overwhelmed, de- fensive, or off balance. All these responses are natural and reasonable; in some cases they are unavoidable. The solution isn't to pretend you don't have them. It's to recognize what's happening and learn how to derive beneﬁt from feedback even when it sets off one or more of your triggers.

            Six steps to becoming a
                 better receiver

Taking feedback well is a process of sorting and ﬁlter- ing. You need to understand the other person's point of view, try on ideas that may at ﬁrst seem a poor ﬁt, and experiment with different ways of doing things. You also need to discard or shelve critiques that are genuinely misdirected or are not helpful right away.

                             55

Resilience

But it's nearly impossible to do any of those things from inside a triggered response. Instead of ushering you into a nuanced conversation that will help you learn, your triggers prime you to reject, counterat- tack, or withdraw. The six steps below will keep you from throwing valuable feedback onto the discard pile or---just as damaging---accepting and acting on comments that you would be better off disregarding. They are pre- sented as advice to the receiver. But, of course, under- standing the challenges of receiving feedback helps the giver be more effective, too.

              1. Know your tendencies

You've been getting feedback all your life, so there are no doubt patterns in how you respond. Do you de- fend yourself on the facts ("This is plain wrong"), ar- gue about the method of delivery ("You're really doing

this by email?"), or strike back ("You, of all people?")? Do you smile on the outside but seethe on the in- side? Do you get teary or ﬁlled with righteous indig- nation? And what role does the passage of time play? Do you tend to reject feedback in the moment and then step back and consider it over time? Do you ac- cept it all immediately but later decide it's not valid? Do you agree with it intellectually but have trouble changing your behavior? When Michael, an advertising executive, hears his boss make an offhand joke about his lack of pro- fessionalism, it hits him like a sledgehammer. "I'm ﬂooded with shame," he told us, "and all my failings rush to mind, as if I'm Googling 'things wrong with me' and getting 1.2 million hits, with sponsored ads from my father and my ex. In this state it's hard to see the feedback at 'actual size.'" But now that Michael understands his standard operating procedure, he's able to make better choices about where to go from

there: "I can reassure myself that I'm exaggerating, and usually after I sleep on it, I'm in a better place to ﬁgure out whether there's something I can learn."

    2. Disentangle the “what” from the “who”

If the feedback is on target and the advice is wise, it shouldn't matter who delivers it. But it does. When a relationship trigger is activated, entwining the con- tent of comments with your feelings about the giver (or about how, when, or where she delivered the com- ments), learning is short-circuited. To keep that from happening, you have to work to separate the message from the messenger, and then consider both. Janet, a chemist and a team leader at a pharma- ceutical company, received glowing comments from her peers and superiors during her 360-degree review but was surprised by the negative feedback she got from her direct reports. She immediately concluded that the problem was theirs: "I have high standards,

                           58

Find the Coaching in Criticism

and some of them can't handle that," she remembers thinking. "They aren't used to someone holding their feet to the ﬁre." In this way, she changed the subject from her management style to her subordinates' competence, preventing her from learning something important about the impact she had on others. Eventually the penny dropped, Janet says. "I came to see that whether it was their performance prob- lem or my leadership problem, those were not mu- tually exclusive issues, and both were worth solving." She was able to disentangle the issues and talk to her team about both. Wisely, she began the conversation with their feedback to her, asking, "What am I doing that's making things tough? What would improve the situation?"

              3. Sort toward coaching

Some feedback is evaluative ("Your rating is a 4"); some is coaching ("Here's how you can improve").

                            59

Resilience

Everyone needs both. Evaluations tell you where you stand, what to expect, and what is expected of you. Coaching allows you to learn and improve and helps you play at a higher level. It's not always easy to distinguish one from the other. When a board member phoned James to sug- gest that he start the next quarter's CFO presentation with analyst predictions rather than internal projec- tions, was that intended as a helpful suggestion, or was it a veiled criticism of his usual approach? When in doubt, people tend to assume the worst and to put even well-intentioned coaching into the evaluation bin. Feeling judged is likely to set off your identity triggers, and the resulting anxiety can drown out the opportunity to learn. So whenever possible, sort to- ward coaching. Work to hear feedback as potentially valuable advice from a fresh perspective rather than as an indictment of how you've done things in the past. When James took that approach, "the sugges- tion became less emotionally loaded," he says. "I de-

                              60

Find the Coaching in Criticism

cided to hear it as simply an indication of how that board member might more easily digest quarterly information."

                4. Unpack the feedback

Often it's not immediately clear whether feedback is valid and useful. So before you accept or reject it, do some analysis to better understand it. Here's a hypothetical example. Kara, who's in sales, is told by Johann, an experienced colleague, that she needs to "be more assertive." Her reaction might be to reject his advice ("I think I'm pretty assertive al- ready"). Or she might acquiesce ("I really do need to step it up"). But before she decides what to do, she needs to understand what he really means. Does he think she should speak up more often, or just with greater conviction? Should she smile more or less? Have the conﬁdence to admit she doesn't know some- thing or the conﬁdence to pretend she does?

                              61

Resilience

Even the simple advice to "be more assertive" comes from a complex set of observations and judg- ments that Johann has made while watching Kara in meetings and with customers. Kara needs to dig into the general suggestion and ﬁnd out what in particular prompted it. What did Johann see her do or fail to do? What did he expect, and what is he worried about? In other words, where is the feedback coming from? Kara also needs to know where the feedback is going---exactly what Johann wants her to do differ- ently and why. After a clarifying discussion, she might agree that she is less assertive than others on the sales ﬂoor but disagree with the idea that she should change. If all her sales heroes are quiet, humble, and deeply curious about customers' needs, Kara's view of what it means to be good at sales might look and sound very different from Johann's Glengarry Glen Ross ideal. When you set aside snap judgments and take time to explore where feedback is coming from and where

                          62

Find the Coaching in Criticism

it's going, you can enter into a rich, informative con- versation about perceived best practices---whether you decide to take the advice or not.

               5. Ask for just one thing

Feedback is less likely to set off your emotional trig- gers if you request it and direct it. So don't wait until your annual performance review. Find opportunities to get bite-size pieces of coaching from a variety of people throughout the year. Don't invite criticism with a big, unfocused question like "Do you have any feedback for me?" Make the process more manage- able by asking a colleague, a boss, or a direct report, "What's one thing you see me doing (or failing to do) that holds me back?" That person may name the ﬁrst behavior that comes to mind or the most important one on his or her list. Either way, you'll get concrete information and can tease out more speciﬁcs at your own pace.

Roberto, a fund manager at a ﬁnancial services ﬁrm, found his 360-degree review process over- whelming and confusing. "Eighteen pages of charts and graphs and no ability to have follow-up conver- sations to clarify the feedback was frustrating," he says, adding that it also left him feeling awkward around his colleagues. Now Roberto taps two or three people each quar- ter to ask for one thing he might work on. "They don't offer the same things, but over time I hear themes, and that gives me a good sense of where my growth edge lies," he says. "And I have really good conver- sations---with my boss, with my team, even with peers where there's some friction in the relationship. They're happy to tell me one thing to change, and of- ten they're right. It does help us work more smoothly together." Research has shown that those who explicitly seek critical feedback (that is, who are not just ﬁshing for praise) tend to get higher performance ratings. Why?

                            64

Find the Coaching in Criticism

Mainly, we think, because someone who's asking for coaching is more likely to take what is said to heart and genuinely improve. But also because when you ask for feedback, you not only ﬁnd out how others see you, you also inﬂuence how they see you. Solic- iting constructive criticism communicates humility, respect, passion for excellence, and conﬁdence, all in one go.

             6. Engage in small experiments

After you've worked to solicit and understand feed- back, it may still be hard to discern which bits of advice will help you and which ones won't. We suggest designing small experiments to ﬁnd out. Even though you may doubt that a suggestion will be useful, if the downside risk is small and the upside potential is large, it's worth a try. James, the CFO we discussed earlier, decided to take the board member's advice for the next presentation and see what happened. Some

                              65

Resilience

directors were pleased with the change, but the shift in format prompted others to offer suggestions of their own. Today James reverse-engineers his presentations to meet board members' current top-of-mind con- cerns. He sends out an email a week beforehand ask- ing for any burning questions and either front-loads his talk with answers to them or signals at the start that he will get to them later on. "It's a little more challenging to prepare for but actually much easier to give," he says. "I spend less time ﬁelding unexpected questions, which was the hardest part of the job." That's an example worth following. When some- one gives you advice, test it out. If it works, great. If it doesn't, you can try again, tweak your approach, or decide to end the experiment. Criticism is never easy to take. Even when you know that it's essential to your development and you trust that the person delivering it wants you to succeed, it can activate psychologi- cal triggers. You might feel misjudged, ill-used, and sometimes threatened to your very core.

                           66

Your growth depends on your ability to pull value from criticism in spite of your natural responses and on your willingness to seek out even more advice and coaching from bosses, peers, and subordinates. They may be good or bad at providing it, or they may have little time for it---but you are the most important fac- tor in your own development. If you're determined to learn from whatever feedback you get, no one can stop you.

       Firing Back
     How Great Leaders Rebound
       After Career Disasters

By Jeﬀrey A. Sonnenfeld and Andrew J. Ward

                   69

A mong the tests of a leader, few are more challenging---and more painful---than recov- ering from a career catastrophe, whether it is caused by natural disaster, illness, misconduct, slipups, or unjust conspiratorial overthrow. But real leaders don't cave in. Defeat energizes them to rejoin the fray with greater determination and vigor. Take the case of Jamie Dimon, who was ﬁred as president of Citigroup but now is CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Or look at Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, who was removed from his position as president of Wellington Management but then went on to cre- ate the index fund and become a leading voice for

                         71

governance reform. Similarly, there's former Coca- Cola president Steve Heyer, who was surprisingly passed over for the CEO position at Coke but then was quickly named head of Starwood Hotels. Most colorful, perhaps, is Donald Trump, who recovered from two rounds of ﬁnancial distress in his casino business and is admired today both as a hugely suc- cessful estate developer and as a producer and star of popular reality TV shows---and of course ran success- fully for President of the United States. These stories are still the exception rather than the rule. F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous observation that there are no second acts in American lives casts an especially dark shadow over the derailed careers of business leaders. In our research---analyzing more than 450 CEO successions between 1988 and 1992 at large, publicly traded companies---we found that only 35% of ousted CEOs returned to an active execu- tive role within two years of departure; 22% stepped back and took only advisory roles, generally coun- seling smaller organizations or sitting on boards.

                          72

Firing Back

But 43% effectively ended their careers and went into retirement. What prevents a deposed leader from coming back? Leaders who cannot recover have a tendency to blame themselves and are often tempted to dwell on the past rather than look to the future. They secretly hold themselves responsible for their career setback, whether they were or not, and get caught in a psycho- logical web of their own making, unable to move be- yond the position they no longer hold. This dynamic is usually reinforced by well-meaning colleagues and even by family and friends, who may try to lay blame in an attempt to make sense of the chaos surround- ing the disaster. Sadly, their advice can often be more damaging than helpful. In every culture, the ability to transcend life's ad- versity is an essential feature of becoming a great leader. In his inﬂuential 1949 book, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, anthropologist Joseph Campbell showed us that the various stories of great leaders around the world, in every culture and every era, are

                           73

Resilience

all essentially the same story---the "hero myth." This myth is embodied in the life stages of such univer- sal archetypes as Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, Bud- dha, Aeneas, Odysseus, and the Aztecs' Tezcatlipoca. Transformational leaders follow a path that entails a call to greatness, early successes (involving tough choices), ongoing trials, profound setbacks, and, ul- timately, triumph as they reintegrate into society. If Campbell were writing today, he might want to include business leaders in his study, as they must confront similar trials on their way to greatness. This article is intended to help leaders---or anyone suffering from an unexpected setback---examine their often abrupt fall from grace and to give them a pro- cess through which they can recover, and even exceed their past accomplishments. From our 22 years of interviews with 300 ﬁred CEOs and other derailed professionals, our scholarly study of leadership, our consulting assignments, and our own searing personal experiences, we are convinced that leaders can tri- umph over tragedy, provided they take conscious steps

                          74

Firing Back

to do so. For a start, they must carefully decide how to ﬁght back. Once this crucial decision has been taken, they must recruit others into battle. They must then take steps to recover their heroic status, in the process proving to themselves and others that they have the mettle necessary to rediscover their heroic mission. Few people exemplify this journey better than President Jimmy Carter. After his devastating 1980 reelection loss to Ronald Reagan, Carter was emo- tionally fatigued. As he told us sometime later, "I returned to Plains, Georgia, completely exhausted, slept for almost 24 hours, and then awoke to an al- together new, unwanted, and potentially empty life." While proud of his achievements---his success in de- regulating energy, for example, his efforts to promote global human rights, and his ability to broker peace between Israel and Egypt through the Camp David Accords---post election, Carter needed to move past his sense of frustration and rejection, particularly his failure to secure the timely release of the American hostages in Iran.

                            75

Resilience

Despite his pain and humiliation, Carter did not retreat into anger or self-pity. He realized that his global prominence gave him a forum to ﬁght to restore his inﬂuential role in world events. Accord- ingly, he recruited others into battle by enlisting the enthusiastic support of his wife, Rosalynn, several members of his administration, academic research- ers in the sciences and social sciences, world lead- ers, and ﬁnancial backers to build the Carter Center. He proved his mettle by refusing to remove himself from the fray. Indeed, he continued to involve himself in international conﬂict mediation in Ethiopia and Eritrea, Liberia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Venezuela, dem- onstrating in the process that he was not a has-been. He regained his heroic stature when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 "for his decades of untiring effort to ﬁnd peaceful solutions to interna- tional conﬂicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social develop- ment." And he has rediscovered his heroic mission by

                          76

Firing Back

using the Carter Center to continue his drive to ad- vance human rights and alleviate needless suffering. Let us look now at how some great business lead- ers have followed the same path to recover from their own disastrous career setbacks.

           Decide how to ﬁght back

The ﬁrst decision you will face in responding to a career disaster is the question of whether to con- front the situation that brought you down---with an exhausting, expensive, and perhaps embarrassing battle---or to try to put it behind you as quickly as pos- sible, in the hope that no one will notice or remember for long. In some cases, it's best to avoid direct and immediate confrontation. Home Depot cofounder Bernie Marcus, for example, decided to sidestep the quicksand of litigation against Sandy Sigoloff, the conglomerateur who ﬁred Marcus from Handy Dan

                           77

Resilience

Home Improvement. Marcus made his battleground the marketplace rather than the courtroom. Thanks to this strategy, he was free to set the historic course for the Home Depot, which now under his succes- sor is approaching \$100 billion in sales, with several hundred thousand employees. Other comeback kids also began with a grace- ful retreat. Jamie Dimon was sacked as president of Citigroup by then chairman Sandy Weill following 16 years of partnership in building the institution. When he spoke to us and to others, he did not dwell on his disappointment or sense of injustice. Monica Langley in her 2003 book Tearing Down the Walls describes what happened when Weill asked Dimon to resign. Dimon was shocked but replied, "You've obviously thought this through, and there's nothing I can do." As he scanned the already-prepared press release, Dimon saw that the board agreed with Weill. The ﬁrm offered Dimon a generous, nonrestrictive severance package, so a battle with Weill seemed pointless. While he was unemployed, Dimon read

                          78

Firing Back

biographies of great national leaders who had truly suffered. He also took up boxing---another way, per- haps, of dealing with the stress and pain. After a year of this, Dimon decided he needed closure, so he invited Weill to lunch at the Four Seasons to thank him. As Dimon recounts in Harvey Mackay's 2004 book, We Got Fired!: "I had mellowed by then. Sandy wasn't going to call me. . . . I knew I was ready to say thank you for what he did for me. I also knew he and I should talk about what happened. I wanted to get this event behind me so I could move on. Part of me said I had spent sixteen years with him. Twelve or thirteen were pretty good. You can't just look at one side and not the other. I made my own mistakes; I acknowledged I was partly to blame. Whether I was 40 percent or 60 percent to blame really didn't mat- ter. I felt very good about my meeting with him." In this way, Dimon was able to turn his ouster into an event that yielded both helpful perspective and re- assuring resolution. (See the sidebar "Getting Beyond Rage and Denial.")

        GETTING BEYOND RAGE AND DENIAL

One of the most important steps on the route to re- covery is to confront and acknowledge failure. This can be as simple as understanding the Machiavellian politics of others. So as you set about rebuilding your career, make sure you:

    • Remember that failure is a beginning, not an
       end. Comeback is always possible.

    • Look to the future. Preemptive actions are
       often more eﬀective than reactive ones—even
       if they only take the form of standing back and
       reﬂecting on what to do next.

About six months after that lunch, in March 2000, Dimon became CEO of Bank One, a huge Chicago bank that survived the merger of First Chicago and the original Banc One. That year, Bank One posted a loss of \$511 million. Three years later, under Dimon's

                              80

    • Help people deal with your failure. Even close
       friends may avoid you because they don’t know
       what to say or do. Let them know that you are
       ready for assistance and what kind of aid would
       be most useful.

leadership, Bank One was earning record proﬁts of \$3.5 billion, and its stock price had soared 85%. Add- ing to the sweetness of vindication, the following year Bank One merged with JPMorgan Chase, an institu- tion with which Weill had long wanted Citigroup to merge. Dimon became CEO of the new company and is now widely regarded as one of the most inﬂuential ﬁnancial executives in the world.

                             81

Resilience

Of course, it's not always a good decision to sit on the sidelines and presume that justice will prevail. The highly respected Nick Nicholas, outmaneuvered as CEO of Time Warner by his skilled rival Gerald Levin, never challenged his old ﬁrm. He went off to Vail to ski at the time, awaiting a call back to service, soon becoming a very successful investor in new busi- nesses, a professor, and a board director. But he never regained his role as the leader of a great public en- terprise. Other deposed CEOs, such as Ford's Jacques Nasser, Hewlett-Packard's Carly Fiorina, IBM's John Akers, United Air Lines' Richard Ferris, and Apple's John Sculley have similarly failed to return to lead major public ﬁrms. They were considered brilliant leaders by many and were never accused of plunder- ing the shareholders' wealth, like some rogue CEOs of recent years. But they never fought back, and they disappeared from the corner ofﬁce. The key determinant in the ﬁght-or-ﬂight ques- tion is the damage (or potential damage) incurred to

                           82

Firing Back

the leader's reputation---the most important resource of all leaders. While departed CEOs and other lead- ers may have enough other resources and experience to rebound, it is their reputation that will make the difference between successful career recovery and failure. Fights that will result only in a Pyrrhic victory are best avoided. Battles of pure revenge can resem- ble Shakespearean tragedies, where all parties lose. Hewlett-Packard board member Tom Perkins, for example, in trying to defend his friend and fellow director George Keyworth from allegations of leak- ing conﬁdential board discussions, not only brought down HP chairman Patricia Dunn but also caused his friend far greater humiliation, forcing him off the board as well. A leader must consider whether ﬁght- ing the allegations will exacerbate the damage by making the accusations more public. When, however, the allegations are not only sufﬁ- cient to cause a catastrophic career setback but would

                           83

Resilience

also block a career comeback, then leaders need to ﬁght back. Consider former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon. He was a triumphant commander on the Egyptian front in the Six Day War of 1967. Fifteen years later, as minister of defense, Sharon initiated an attack on the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon. Christian militias seized the opportunity to massacre hundreds of Palestinians in acts of revenge against the PLO in the Israeli-controlled Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. In a February 21, 1983, cover story, Time maga- zine reported that these massacres were the result of a plot between Sharon and the militias to avenge the killing of Lebanon's Christian president Bashir Ge- mayel. Sharon sued Time in Israel and in New York in lengthy litigation. In both places, juries found Time's accusations to be false and defamatory. The magazine settled and apologized. "It was a very long and hard struggle and was worth it," Sharon said publically at

                            84

Firing Back

the time. "I came here to prove that Time magazine lied: We were able to prove that Time did lie." A ferocious warrior, Sharon took on this carefully calculated battle for his reputation and executed it with focus and determination. He knew that if he did not vigorously defend himself, no one else would be able to help him. Sharon could not have regained his honor and returned to public ofﬁce if he had not challenged these false charges and then moved on with his life.

            Recruit others into battle

Whether you ﬁght or tactically retreat for a while, it is essential to engage others right from the start to join your battle to put your career back on track. Friends and acquaintances play an instrumental role in pro- viding support and advice in the process of recovery.

                            85

Resilience

Those who really care for you can help you gain per- spective on the good and bad choices you have made. You are also more likely to make yourself vulnerable with those you trust. Without such vulnerability, you cannot hope to achieve the candid, self-critical per- spective you will need to learn from your experience. Still, although family and friends can provide invalu- able personal support, they may be less effective when it comes to practical career assistance. Research has shown that slight acquaintances are actually more helpful than close friends in steering you toward op- portunities for new positions in other organizations. In an acclaimed study, Stanford University's Mark Granovetter discovered that of those individuals who landed jobs through personal contacts, only 16.7% found them through people they saw at least twice a week; 55.6% found positions through acquaintances seen at least once a year. But 27.8% of job candidates found work through distant acquaintances, whom they saw less than once a year---old college friends,

                         86

Firing Back

former workmates, or people known through pro- fessional associations. In other words, more job contacts will come to you through people you see less than once a year than from people you see twice or more a week. That's because close friends share the same networks as you do, whereas acquaintances are more likely to introduce you to new people and contacts. Indeed, through the power of acquaintance networks, you can reach almost anyone within a few steps. Thus, distant acquaintances that don't appear to have any connection to you may prove key to your recovery when you are trying to get back on your feet. But it's not enough to have a wide network of acquaintances. The quality of the connections, even the more distant ones, matters as well. That was the case for Home Depot's Bernie Marcus. Marcus was devastated when he was ﬁred as CEO of Handy Dan on what he felt were trumped-up charges made by Sandy Sigoloff, the threatened boss of the parent company, Daylin. "There was a lot of self-pity on my

                          87

Resilience

part," Marcus told us. "I was drowning in my sorrow, going several nights at a time without sleeping. For the ﬁrst time in my adult life, instead of building, I was more concerned with surviving." Marcus, however, had an unexpected resource. Whether they were close friends and colleagues with whom he worked or acquaintances he dealt with on a casual basis, Marcus treated others with uncommon honesty, respect, and trust. This consideration was re- ciprocated by people in his network when he needed help; it was one of his less frequent acquaintances, Rip Fleming at Security Paciﬁc National Bank, who made it possible for Marcus to launch Home Depot. Marcus had raised \$2 million in seed money for the Home Depot venture, but that was not enough to get his new company off the ground. He applied to several banks for a line of credit but was turned down every time. Eventually, he knocked at Fleming's door at Security Paciﬁc National. Both Marcus and Flem- ing believed that the relationship between banker

                          88

Firing Back

and client should amount to more than just the busi- ness transactions they conducted. Consequently, Fleming had become an adviser to Marcus at Handy Dan. Despite these strong professional ties, though, Fleming was initially reluctant to issue a line of credit until Marcus ﬂew out to Los Angeles and sold Flem- ing on the idea. In the end, Security Paciﬁc National provided a \$3.5 million line of credit, which enabled Home Depot to get up and running. Unbeknownst to Marcus, the proposal was repeatedly turned down by the bank's loan committee and was approved only when Fleming marched into the president's ofﬁce with his resignation letter in hand. How you build relationships has a huge impact on your prospects for career recovery. Marcus had a way of building relatively strong relationships even in cir- cumstances when most people would settle for weak acquaintanceships. This capacity for afﬁliation is a litmus test of a leader's ability to bounce back. People who can create connections are much more likely to

                            89

Resilience

engender the kind of help they need when fate turns against them.

          Recover your heroic status

It's not enough for you to recruit others to advance your career. To launch your comeback, you must ac- tually do things to win back the support of a wider audience. To manage this, you must regain what we call your heroic status. The great leader has a heroic persona that confers a larger-than-life presence. You can achieve this sta- tus by developing a personal dream that you offer as a public possession. If your dream is accepted, you achieve renown. If for whatever reason your public vision is ultimately discarded, you suffer the loss of both your private dream and your public identity. Af- ter a career disaster, you can rebound only if you are able to rebuild your heroic stature---that is, the public

reputation with which you were previously perceived. An intrinsic part of recovering this heroic status in- volves getting your story out. This calls for a public campaign to educate and inform. When a CEO is ﬁred, the true causes for the dis- missal are often deliberately hidden, as the board seeks to protect the reputation of the ﬁrm and itself. The organization often engages in elaborate face- saving activities to disguise the real nature of the exit. Euphemistically, the press reports that the CEO re- signed "for personal reasons" or "to spend more time with family." In our interviews with dismissed CEOs, we found that their greatest frustration stemmed from not being able to rebuild their heroic stat- ure by telling their side of the story. We have inter- viewed several people who had seven-ﬁgure separa- tion agreements that were contingent on their toeing the party line when they left. That's a problem when CEOs are publicly sacriﬁced even though they are not guilty of the accusations that led to their ouster. In

                            91

such cases, CEOs' inability to challenge and set the record straight can lead to destructive speculation in the press, which can damage their reputations so much that it becomes all but impossible to recover. Popular wisdom holds that a deposed leader should sign the nondisparagement agreement, accept the noncompete clause, take the money, and run. Our strong belief is that such agreements are a mistake. In the end, your cash will disappear, and you won't be able to get your story out. If you agree not to speak out, be prepared to be unemployed for a number of years. A lesser-known player in the Enron saga, Dan- iel Scotto, comes to mind. Scotto was the ﬁnancial analyst who headed up the research department for the large global investment bank Paribas. Early on, Scotto said that Enron was losing money in all its mainstream businesses and that it was only through offshore ﬁnagling that the company was creating the image of proﬁtability. Paribas, which was underwrit-

                          92

ing a large part of the debt, asked Scotto to recant. When he wouldn't, Paribas put him on an imposed medical leave for three weeks and then ﬁred him. He was forced to sign a nondisparagement agreement that hurt his ability to get his story out. Scotto has been unemployed for ﬁve years. Martha Stewart is the best reminder that it doesn't have to be that way. As the most public example in re- cent times of a CEO who got her story out, Stewart is a model for how to regain your heroic status. She did it by carefully orchestrating a multitiered campaign to restore her reputation. The day after she was indicted for obstruction of justice in the federal government's insider-trading in- vestigation of ImClone stock, Stewart took out a full- page advertisement in USA Today and the New York Times and launched a new website, marthatalks. com. In an open letter to her public, Stewart clearly proclaimed her innocence and her intention to clear her name. She understood intuitively that when a

hero stumbles, constituents have to reconcile two conﬂicting images of the person---the larger-than-life presence the hero once commanded and the hero's new fallen state. In her letter, Stewart managed to eliminate the confusion by making sure that people knew her side of the story. She openly denied any charges of insider trading and hammered home the unreliability of the three witnesses upon which the government based its case. Stewart very proactively helped others continue to believe in her heroic status. Stewart's open letter was supported by a statement on her website by her attorneys, Robert G. Morvillo and John J. Tigue Jr., who challenged the media to investigate why the government waited nearly a year and a half to ﬁle the charges. "Is it because she is a woman who has successfully competed in a man's business world by virtue of her talent, hard work, and demanding standards?" they asked. With the aid of her attorneys, Stewart ingeni- ously---and successfully---portrayed herself as a Da-

vid struggling in a just and valiant quest against the Goliath of government. Her fans, far from abandon- ing a fallen star, rallied around her. The astounding strength of this sentiment is measured in the stock price of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Even at the midpoint of Stewart's prison sentence, the stock had not merely rebounded---it was 50% higher than before anybody had heard of ImClone and the ill- fated stock transaction. Upon her release from prison, the share price neared an all-time high, ad revenue at her magazines picked up, and she launched two na- tional network TV shows. The more Stewart got her story out, the more loyal her public became. Stewart managed to provide a reassuring account of what really happened in her case. But what if you can't? What if you have truly stumbled? If you cannot refute the facts of your dismissal because they are so condemning, show authentic remorse. The public is often enormously forgiving of genuine contrition and atonement.

               Prove your mettle

Protecting your reputation by knowing how to ﬁght unjust accusations and bringing others on board are both essential precursors to relaunching a career in the aftermath of catastrophe. Ultimately, however, you will recover fully only when you take on that next role or start a new organization. When you show that you can still perform at a credible or superior level, others will begin to think of you as having the mettle to triumph over your career calamity. (See the sidebar "How to Come Back.") Showing mettle is not easy. Fallen leaders face many barriers on the path to recovery, not least of which are doubts in their own ability to get back to the top. As one ﬁred CEO told us, "I'd never sit here and say, 'Geez, all I have to do is just replicate and do it again.' The chances of doing it again are pretty small." Yet leaders who rebound are unfailingly those who get over this doubt about their ability to do it

                 HOW TO COME BACK

Our interviews with some 300 derailed CEOs and other professionals, as well as our scholarly lead- ership research, consulting assignments, and per- sonal experiences, have brought to light ﬁve key steps for rebounding from career disaster. Anyone trying to recover from a catastrophic setback can use these steps to match, or even exceed, their past accomplishments.

• Decide how to ﬁght back. Pyrrhic victories will hurt you by calling attention to the accusations leveled against you. But when your reputation is unfairly damaged, you must take quick action.

• Recruit others into battle. Friends and family can provide comfort and, perhaps, some perspective in your hour of need. But acquain- tances may be more important in landing that next job. (Continued)

                          97

• Recover your heroic status. Deposed leaders are often advised to sign nondisparagement agreements. Don't do it. Engage instead in a multitiered campaign to clear your reputation and restore your stature.

• Prove your mettle. After suﬀering career disas- ter, you will probably have doubts about your ability to get back to the top. You must over- come that insecurity and in the process ﬁnd the courage to prove to others---and yourself---that you have not lost your magic touch.

• Rediscover your heroic mission. It is the single- minded pursuit of a lasting legacy that sets great leaders apart. To recover from a disas- trous setback, ﬁnd a new heroic mission that renews your passion and creates new meaning in your life.

again. Even when forced from familiar arenas into to- tally new ﬁelds, some leaders remain unafraid of try- ing new ventures. This capacity to bounce back from adversity---to prove your inner strength once more by overcoming your shattered conﬁdence---is critical to earning lasting greatness. Take Mickey Drexler. When Gap founder Donald Fisher poached Drexler away from Ann Taylor in 1983, the Gap was struggling to compete, since it sold the same brands of clothing as everyone else and was caught in a pricing game. Drexler expanded the re- tailer beyond the core Gap stores to brand extension such as GapKids, babyGap, and GapBody, as well as introducing other complementary brands, including Banana Republic and Old Navy. Between the time he arrived in 1983 and 2000, Gap's sales increased from \$480 million to \$13.7 billion, and its stock rose 169-fold. Then things began to go awry. Drexler was ac- cused of having lost his touch as a prescient mer- chant; suspicion arose in the minds of analysts and

                          99

Resilience

in the media that the goods had become too trendy. Although some people have suggested that the real problem was that Fisher's brother had built too many stores too close to one another, Drexler was blamed for the slump, as same-store sales dropped every quarter for two years, and the stock plummeted 75%. On May 21, 2002, Drexler presented the upcoming season's merchandise to the board, conﬁdent that he had a great selling line for the fall. It wasn't enough for the directors, and the next morning Fisher ﬁred him, believing that the company was now too large for Drexler's hands-on management style. Drexler was by this time independently wealthy, but he was nonetheless determined to prove that the failures of the previous two years were not primarily his fault and did not reﬂect his abilities. He knew that the only way to restore his belief in himself, as well as other people's conﬁdence in him, was to return to a role in which he could once again demonstrate his expertise. He turned down a multimillion-dollar severance package from Gap because it contained

                          100

Firing Back

a noncompete clause. After he explored a few other avenues, opportunity came knocking in the guise of struggling fashion retailer J.Crew. With only about 200 stores, J.Crew was a small fraction of the Gap's size and consequently much more amenable to Drexler's hands-on style, giving him a greater opportunity to make an impact. Drex- ler invested \$10 million of his own money to buy a 22% stake in the company from the retailer's private owner, the investment ﬁrm Texas Paciﬁc. He took a salary that was less than a tenth of what he had earned at his former employer. "You've no idea how much it's costing me to run this company," he joked in a New York magazine article shortly after taking over. The results more than proved that Drexler still had the right stuff. J.Crew rebounded from a \$30 million operating loss in 2003 to an operating proﬁt of over \$37 million in 2004. Same-store sales per square foot, one of the key metrics in retailing, rose 18% from \$338 to \$400, while at his old employer, sales per square foot dropped 3%. By the summer of 2006,

                          101

Resilience

Drexler had increased both sales and proﬁts by 20% and launched a wildly embraced IPO to take J.Crew public. The media celebrated his recovery and ac- knowledged his obvious talent. For Drexler, as for others, the comeback required him to prove his worth in a situation that was per- ceived to be enormously difﬁcult. Start-ups or turn- arounds are common contexts in which fallen leaders can recover grace. It is in these demanding situations that leaders ﬁnd the mettle to prove to themselves and to others that they have not lost their magic touch and that no obstacle is too great to overcome in their quest for return.

       Rediscover your heroic mission

Most great leaders want to build a legacy that will last beyond their lifetime. This does not mean having their names etched on an ivy-clad university ediface

                            102

Firing Back

but rather advancing society by building and leading an organization. This is what we call the leader's he- roic mission. Most of the leaders we have proﬁled in this arti- cle were deeply engaged in building a lasting legacy even before they suffered their career setbacks. It is the loss of this mission that really raises a derailment to catastrophic proportions in the leader's own mind, since it puts at risk a lifetime of achievement. On the day Steve Jobs was ﬁred from Apple in 1985, for example, his friend Mike Murray was so concerned about Jobs's reaction that he went over to Jobs's house and sat with him for hours until Murray was convinced that Jobs would not commit suicide. Jobs did not wallow in despair for long. A week after his ouster from Apple, he ﬂew to Europe and, after a few days in Paris, headed for the Tuscan hills of northern Italy, where he bought a bicycle and a sleeping bag and camped out under the stars, con- templating what he would do next. From Italy, he

                          103

Resilience

went to Sweden and then to Russia before return- ing home. Once back in California, with his passion and ambition renewed, Jobs set about re-creating himself as a force in the IT world. He went on to found another computer company, NeXT, which Apple purchased in 1996 for \$400 million, at which point Jobs returned to Apple and at the same time became the driving force behind the hugely success- ful computer-graphics studio Pixar. Once back at Apple, Jobs revived and reenergized the company with breakthrough, high-design products, such as the iMac, iBook, and iPod, and took the company into emerging businesses, such as iTunes. Like Martha Stewart, Steve Jobs was able to recap- ture his original heroic mission. Other deposed lead- ers, however, must truly start again because the door to their familiar ﬁeld is ﬁrmly closed, and they must seek new opportunities and create a totally new he- roic mission.

That's what Drexel Burnham Lambert ﬁnancier Michael Milken, the imaginative "king of the junk bonds," had to do. Milken's life was almost the incar- nation of the American dream. Born on the Fourth of July, Milken had become a billionaire by his mid- forties and one of the most inﬂuential ﬁnanciers in the world. Then it all came tumbling down. He was charged with a 98-count criminal indictment, and a massive civil case was brought against him by the SEC for insider trading, stock parking, price ma- nipulation, racketeering, and defrauding customers, among other crimes. He ended up pleading guilty to six relatively minor counts. In November 1990, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, agreed to pay \$600 million at the time, and ended up paying a further \$42 million over a probation violation. Af- ter serving 22 months, Milken was released early for cooperating with other inquiries. But he was barred from the securities industry for life.

                           105

A week later, Milken was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was told he had 12 to 18 months to live. He immediately turned his maniacal zeal into a new heroic mission to conquer this disease. Through ag- gressive treatment and his own dietary research, he survived to build a huge foundation supporting re- search to battle prostate cancer. He also created an economic research institute that attracts the world's top scientiﬁc, political, religious, and business lead- ers. Milken still argues that he was wrongly accused. Others may disagree, but few would doubt that he has earned restitution. The public has come to ac- cept that he has paid for his crimes, and there has even been some reconsideration of their actual severity. It is the single-minded, passionate pursuit of a heroic mission that sets leaders like Steve Jobs and Michael Milken and Jimmy Carter apart from the general population, and it is what attracts and mo- tivates followers to join them. In the worst of cases,

to have that life purpose ripped from you and to be prohibited from its further pursuit can leave an un- bearable void and doubts as to your reason for being. Finding a new mission to replace your lifelong pur- pose can be a great struggle, but one that is necessary if you are to recover. The tragedies and triumphant comebacks of the leaders we have proﬁled in this article can seem re- mote, bordering on the mythological, perhaps. But their stories point to important lessons about recov- ering from career catastrophe. Stunning comeback is possible in all industries, though the challenges vary according to the leadership norms of each ﬁeld's culture. For example, clergy ensnarled in publicized sex scandals will probably see their careers dissolve, whereas entertainment ﬁgures may not only recover but actually beneﬁt from notoriety. Where one pro- fession values trust, another values celebrity. Thus, recovery plans must be adapted to the cultures of dif- ferent industries.

                            107

Whatever the arena in which your recovery takes shape, the important thing to remember is that we all have choices in life, even in defeat. We can lose our health, our loved ones, our jobs, but much can be saved. No one can truly deﬁne success and failure for us---only we can deﬁne that for ourselves. No one can take away our dignity unless we surrender it. No one can take away our hope and pride unless we relin- quish them. No one can steal our creativity, imagina- tion, and skills unless we stop thinking. No one can stop us from rebounding unless we give up.

Resilience Is About How You Recharge, Not How You Endure

By Shawn Achor and Michelle Gielan

A s constant travelers and parents of a 2-year- old, we sometimes fantasize about how much work we can do when one of us gets on a plane, undistracted by phones, friends, and Find- ing Nemo. We race to get all our ground work done: packing, going through TSA, doing a last-minute work call, calling each other, boarding the plane. Then, when we try to have that amazing in-ﬂight work session, we get nothing done. Even worse, af- ter refreshing our email or reading the same studies over and over, we are too exhausted when we land to soldier on with the emails that have inevitably still piled up.

                        111

Resilience

Why should ﬂying deplete us? We're just sitting there doing nothing. Why can't we be tougher--- more resilient and determined in our work---so we can accomplish all of the goals we set for ourselves? Through our current research, we have come to real- ize that the problem is not our hectic schedule or the plane travel itself; the problem comes from a misun- derstanding of what it means to be resilient and the resulting impact of overworking. We often take a militaristic, "tough" approach to resilience and grit. We imagine a marine slogging through the mud, a boxer going one more round, or a football player picking himself up off the turf for one more play. We believe that the longer we tough it out, the tougher we are, and therefore the more successful we will be. However, this entire conception is scien- tiﬁcally inaccurate. The very lack of a recovery period is dramatically holding back our collective ability to be resilient and successful. Research has found that there is a direct correlation between lack of recovery and increased

                         112

Resilience Is About How You Recharge, Not How You Endure

incidence of health and safety problems.1 And lack of recovery---whether by disrupting sleep with thoughts of work or having continuous cognitive arousal by watching our phones---is costing our companies \$62 billion a year (that's billion, not million) in lost productivity.2 And just because work stops, it doesn't mean we are recovering. We "stop" work sometimes at 5 p.m., but then we spend the night wrestling with solutions to work problems, talking about our work over din- ner, and falling asleep thinking about how much work we'll do tomorrow. In a study released last month, researchers from Norway found that 7.8% of Norwe- gians have become workaholics.3 The scientists cite a deﬁnition of "workaholism" as "being overly con- cerned about work, driven by an uncontrollable work motivation, and investing so much time and effort to work that it impairs other important life areas."4 We believe that this deﬁnition applies to the ma- jority of American workers (including those who read HBR), and this prompted us to begin a study of

                            113

Resilience

workaholism in the United States. Our study will use a large corporate data set from a major medical com- pany to examine how technology extends our work- ing hours and thus interferes with necessary cognitive recovery. We believe this is resulting in huge health care costs and high turnover rates for employers. Misconceptions about resilience is often bred from an early age. Parents trying to teach their chil- dren resilience might celebrate a high school student staying up until 3 a.m. to ﬁnish a science fair proj- ect. What a distortion of resilience! A resilient child is a well-rested one. When an exhausted student goes to school, he risks hurting everyone on the road with his impaired driving, he doesn't have the cogni- tive resources to do well on his English test, he has lower self-control with his friends, and at home, he is moody with his parents. Overwork and exhaustion are the opposite of resilience. And the bad habits we learn when we're young only magnify when we hit the workforce.

                         114

Resilience Is About How You Recharge, Not How You Endure

In her excellent book The Sleep Revolution, Ari- anna Hufﬁngton wrote, "We sacriﬁce sleep in the name of productivity, but ironically our loss of sleep, despite the extra hours we spend at work, adds up to 11 days of lost productivity per year per worker, or about \$2,280." The key to resilience is trying really hard, then stopping, recovering, and then trying again. This conclusion is based on biology. Homeostasis is a fun- damental biological concept describing the ability of the brain to continuously restore and sustain well- being.5 Positive neuroscientist Brent Furl from Texas A&M University coined the term "homeostatic value" to describe the value that certain actions have for cre- ating equilibrium, and thus well-being, in the body. When the body is out of alignment from overwork- ing, we waste vast mental and physical resources try- ing to return to balance before we can move forward. As Power of Full Engagement authors Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz have written, if you have too

                            115

Resilience

much time in the performance zone, you need more time in the recovery zone; otherwise you risk burnout. Mustering your resources to "try hard" re- quires burning energy in order to overcome your currently low arousal level. This is called "upregu- lation." It also exacerbates exhaustion. Thus, the more imbalanced we become due to overworking, the more value there is in activities that allow us to return to a state of balance. The value of a recovery period rises in proportion to the amount of work re- quired of us. So how do we recover and build resilience? Most people assume that if you stop doing a task like an- swering emails or writing a paper that your brain will naturally recover, that when you start again later in the day or the next morning, you'll have your energy back. But surely everyone reading this has had times when they lie in bed for hours, unable to fall asleep because their brain is thinking about work. If you lie in bed for eight hours, you may have rested, but you

                         116

Resilience Is About How You Recharge, Not How You Endure

can still feel exhausted the next day. That's because rest and recovery are not the same thing. Stopping does not equal recovering. If you're trying to build resilience at work, you need adequate internal and external recovery periods. As researchers Fred R. H. Zijlstra, Mark Cropley, and Leif W. Rydstedt write in their 2014 paper: "Internal recovery refers to the shorter periods of relaxation that take place within the frames of the workday or the work setting in the form of short scheduled or unscheduled breaks, by shifting attention or chang- ing to other work tasks when the mental or physical resources required for the initial task are temporarily depleted or exhausted. External recovery refers to ac- tions that take place outside of work---e.g. in the free time between the workdays, and during weekends, holidays or vacations."6 If after work you lie around on your bed and get riled up by political commentary on your phone or get stressed thinking about decisions about how to renovate your home, your brain has not

                            117

Resilience

received a break from high mental arousal states. Our brains need a rest as much as our bodies do. If you really want to build resilience, you can start by strategically stopping. Give yourself the resources to be tough by creating internal and external recovery periods. In her upcoming book The Future of Happi- ness, based on her work at Yale Business School, Amy Blankson describes how to strategically stop during the day by using technology to control overworking.7 She suggests downloading the Instant or Moment apps to see how many times you turn on your phone each day. The average person turns on their phone 150 times every day.8 If every distraction took only one minute (which would be seriously optimistic), that would account for 2.5 hours of every day. You can use apps like Offtime or Unplugged to create tech free zones by strategically scheduling au- tomatic airplane modes. In addition, you can take a cognitive break every 90 minutes to recharge your batteries. Try to not have lunch at your desk, but in-

                         118

Resilience Is About How You Recharge, Not How You Endure

stead spend time outside or with your friends---not talking about work. Take all of your paid time off, which not only gives you recovery periods but raises your productivity and the likelihood of promotion.9 As for us, we've started using our plane time as a work-free zone and thus as time to dip into the re- covery phase. The results have been fantastic. We are usually tired already by the time we get on a plane, and the cramped space and spotty internet connec- tion make work more challenging. Now, instead of swimming upstream, we relax, meditate, sleep, watch movies, journal, or listen to entertaining podcasts. And when we get off the plane, instead of being de- pleted, we feel rejuvenated and ready to return to the performance zone.

                            of Inﬂuence

H7290-Influence.indd 1 9/11/17 7:39 AM H7290-Influence.indd 2 9/11/17 7:39 AM  W e've all encountered people who say less but what they say matters more; people who know how to use silence to dominate an exchange. So having inﬂuence means more than just doing all the talking; it's about taking charge and understanding the roles that positional power, emo- tion, expertise, and nonverbal signals play. These four aspects of inﬂuence are essential to master if you want to succeed as a leader. Take positional power. If you have it, inﬂuence be- comes a relatively simple proposition. People with power over others tend to talk more, to interrupt more, and to guide the conversation more, by picking the topics, for example.

                                            3

H7290-Influence.indd 3 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                  If you don’t have the positional power in a particu-
              lar situation, then, expect to talk less, interrupt less,
              and choose the topics of conversation less. After all,
              exercising their right to talk more about the subjects
              they care for is one of the ways that people with posi-
              tional power demonstrate it.
                  What do you do if you want to challenge the posi-
              tional authority? Perhaps you have a product, or an
              idea, or a company you want to sell, and you have the
              ear of someone who can buy it. How do you get con-
              trol in that kind of situation?
                  The second aspect of inﬂuence is emotion, and us-
              ing it is one way to counteract positional power and
              generally to dominate a conversation. When the other
              side has the power and you have the emotion, some-
              thing closer to parity is possible. Indeed, passion can
              sweep away authority, when it’s well supported and
              the speaker is well prepared. We’ve all witnessed that
              happen when a young unknown performer disarms
              and woos the judges, devastating the competition,
                                          4

H7290-Influence.indd 4 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Understand the Four Components of Inﬂuence

                 in one of those talent competitions. The purity and
                 power of the emotion in the performance is enough
                 to silence—and enlist—the judges despite their po-
                 sitional authority. Indeed, the impassioned speech,
                 the plea for clemency, the summation to the jury that
                 brings them to tears and wins the case for the defen-
                 dant—this is the stuff of Hollywood climaxes.
                     Passion often links with expertise, the third aspect
                 of inﬂuence. And indeed, you can dominate the con-
                 versation, beating out positional power, if you have
                 both passion and expertise. The difﬁdent expert’s
                 voice is sometimes lost in the clamor of people want-
                 ing to be heard. So expertise without passion is not
                 always effective, but if it’s patient, it can be the last
                 person standing in a debate and thereby get its turn.
                     The ﬁnal aspect of inﬂuence is the subtlest of the
                 four and as such rarely can trump either positional
                 authority or passion. But in rare instances, artfully
                 manipulated, I have seen it prevail. What is it? It is
                 the mastery of the dance of human interaction.
                                               5

H7290-Influence.indd 5 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                  We have very little conscious awareness of this as-
              pect of inﬂuence, but we are all participants in it with
              more or less expertise. We learn at a very early age
              that conversation is a pas de deux, a game that two
              (or more) people play that involves breathing, wink-
              ing, nodding, eye contact, head tilts, hand gestures,
              and a whole series of subtle nonverbal signals that
              help both parties communicate with each other.
                  Indeed, conversation is much less functional
              without these nonverbal signals. That’s why phone
              conversations are nowhere near as satisfying as in-
              person encounters and why conference calls inevi-
              tably involve lots more interruptions, miscues, and
              cross talking. We’re not getting the signals we’re used
              to getting to help us know when the other person is
              ready to hand the conversational baton on to us, and
              vice versa.
                  Can you manage inﬂuence only using this fourth
              aspect? I have seen it done in certain situations, but
                                          6

H7290-Influence.indd 6 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Understand the Four Components of Inﬂuence

                 the other three aspects will usually trump this one.
                 Nonetheless, I once watched a senior executive ef-
                 fortlessly dominate a roomful of people who were os-
                 tensibly equal—a group of researchers gathered from
                 around the world to discuss the future of IT. Within a
                 few minutes, everyone in the room was unconsciously
                 deferring to this executive, even though he had no
                 positional power and was not particularly passionate
                 about the subject. His mastery of the subtle signals of
                 conversational cuing was profound, and soon he had
                 everyone dancing to his verbal beat. It was beautiful
                 to watch; he showed complete conversational mas-
                 tery in action.
                     Inﬂuence, then, is a measure of how much skin
                 the participants have in the game, and most of us are
                 unconscious experts at measuring it. To wield it, you
                 need to have the edge in at least one of its four as-
                 pects—and preferably more than one.

A hand- ful of gifted "naturals" simply know how to capture an audience, sway the undecided, and convert the opposition. Watching these masters of persuasion work their magic is at once impressive and frustrating. What's impressive is not just the easy way they use charisma and eloquence to convince others to do as they ask. It's also how eager those oth- ers are to do what's requested of them, as if the per- suasion itself were a favor they couldn't wait to repay. The frustrating part of the experience is that these born persuaders are often unable to account for their remarkable skill or pass it on to others. Their

              way with people is an art, and artists as a rule are
              far better at doing than at explaining. Most of them
              can’t offer much help to those of us who possess no
              more than the ordinary quotient of charisma and elo-
              quence but who still have to wrestle with leadership’s
              fundamental challenge: getting things done through
              others. That challenge is painfully familiar to corpo-
              rate executives, who every day have to ﬁgure out how
              to motivate and direct a highly individualistic work
              force. Playing the “Because I’m the boss” card is out.
              Even if it weren’t demeaning and demoralizing for all
              concerned, it would be out of place in a world where
              cross-functional teams, joint ventures, and intercom-
              pany partnerships have blurred the lines of authority.
              In such an environment, persuasion skills exert far
              greater inﬂuence over others’ behavior than formal
              power structures do.
                  Which brings us back to where we started. Per-
              suasion skills may be more necessary than ever, but
                                        12

                 how can executives acquire them if the most talented
                 practitioners can’t pass them along? By looking to
                 science. For the past ﬁve decades, behavioral scien-
                 tists have conducted experiments that shed consider-
                 able light on the way certain interactions lead people
                 to concede, comply, or change. This research shows
                 that persuasion works by appealing to a limited
                 set of deeply rooted human drives and needs, and
                 it does so in predictable ways. Persuasion, in other
                 words, is governed by basic principles that can be
                 taught, learned, and applied. By mastering these
                 principles, executives can bring scientiﬁc rigor to the
                 business of securing consensus, cutting deals, and
                 winning concessions. In the pages that follow, I de-
                 scribe six fundamental principles of persuasion and
                 suggest a few ways that executives can apply them in
                 their own organizations.

                              The principle of liking:
                          People like those who like them.

                      The application: Uncover real similarities
                             and oﬀer genuine praise.

              The retailing phenomenon known as the Tupperware
              party is a vivid illustration of this principle in action.
              The demonstration party for Tupperware products is
              hosted by an individual, almost always a woman, who
              invites to her home an array of friends, neighbors, and
              relatives. The guests’ affection for their hostess predis-
              poses them to buy from her, a dynamic that was con-
              ﬁrmed by a 1990 study of purchase decisions made
              at demonstration parties. The researchers, Jonathan
              Frenzen and Harry Davis, writing in the Journal of
              Consumer Research, found that the guests’ fondness
              for their hostess weighed twice as heavily in their pur-
              chase decisions as their regard for the products they
                                            14

H7290-Influence.indd 14 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Harnessing the Science of Persuasion

                 bought. So when guests at a Tupperware party buy
                 something, they aren’t just buying to please them-
                 selves. They’re buying to please their hostess as well.
                     What’s true at Tupperware parties is true for busi-
                 ness in general: If you want to inﬂuence people, win
                 friends. How? Controlled research has identiﬁed
                 several factors that reliably increase liking, but two
                 stand out as especially compelling—similarity and
                 praise. Similarity literally draws people together.
                 In one experiment, reported in a 1968 article in the
                 Journal of Personality, participants stood physically
                 closer to one another after learning that they shared
                 political beliefs and social values. And in a 1963 ar-
                 ticle in American Behavioral Scientists, researcher
                 F. B. Evans used demographic data from insurance
                 company records to demonstrate that prospects were
                 more willing to purchase a policy from a salesperson
                 who was akin to them in age, religion, politics, or
                 even cigarette-smoking habits.

H7290-Influence.indd 15 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                  Managers can use similarities to create bonds with
              a recent hire, the head of another department, or even
              a new boss. Informal conversations during the work-
              day create an ideal opportunity to discover at least one
              common area of enjoyment, be it a hobby, a college
              basketball team, or reruns of Seinfeld. The important
              thing is to establish the bond early because it creates a
              presumption of goodwill and trustworthiness in every
              subsequent encounter. It’s much easier to build sup-
              port for a new project when the people you’re trying
              to persuade are already inclined in your favor.
                  Praise, the other reliable generator of affection,
              both charms and disarms. Sometimes the praise
              doesn’t even have to be merited. Researchers at the
              University of North Carolina writing in the Journal
              of Experimental Social Psychology found that men
              felt the greatest regard for an individual who ﬂat-
              tered them unstintingly even if the comments were
              untrue. And in their book Interpersonal Attraction
              (Addison-Wesley, 1978), Ellen Berscheid and Elaine
                                         16

                 Hatﬁeld Walster presented experimental data show-
                 ing that positive remarks about another person’s
                 traits, attitude, or performance reliably generates lik-
                 ing in return, as well as willing compliance with the
                 wishes of the person offering the praise.
                     Along with cultivating a fruitful relationship, adroit
                 managers can also use praise to repair one that’s dam-
                 aged or unproductive. Imagine you’re the manager of
                 a good-sized unit within your organization. Your work
                 frequently brings you into contact with another man-
                 ager—call him Dan—whom you have come to dislike.
                 No matter how much you do for him, it’s not enough.
                 Worse, he never seems to believe that you’re doing the
                 best you can for him. Resenting his attitude and his
                 obvious lack of trust in your abilities and in your good
                 faith, you don’t spend as much time with him as you
                 know you should; in consequence, the performance of
                 both his unit and yours is deteriorating.
                     The research on praise points toward a strategy
                 for ﬁxing the relationship. It may be hard to ﬁnd, but
                                               17

H7290-Influence.indd 17 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

              there has to be something about Dan you can sin-
              cerely admire, whether it’s his concern for the peo-
              ple in his department, his devotion to his family, or
              simply his work ethic. In your next encounter with
              him, make an appreciative comment about that trait.
              Make it clear that in this case at least, you value what
              he values. I predict that Dan will relax his relentless
              negativity and give you an opening to convince him
              of your competence and good intentions.
                          The principle of reciprocity:
                             People repay in kind.

                The application: Give what you want to receive.

              Praise is likely to have a warming and softening ef-
              fect on Dan because, ornery as he is, he is still hu-
              man and subject to the universal human tendency to
              treat people the way they treat him. If you have ever
                                          18

H7290-Influence.indd 18 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Harnessing the Science of Persuasion

                 caught yourself smiling at a coworker just because
                 he or she smiled ﬁrst, you know how this principle
                 works.
                     Charities rely on reciprocity to help them raise
                 funds. For years, for instance, the Disabled Ameri-
                 can Veterans organization, using only a well-crafted
                 fund-raising letter, garnered a very respectable 18%
                 rate of response to its appeals. But when the group
                 started enclosing a small gift in the envelope, the
                 response rate nearly doubled to 35%. The gift—
                 personalized address labels—was extremely modest,
                 but it wasn’t what prospective donors received that
                 made the difference. It was that they had gotten any-
                 thing at all.
                     What works in that letter works at the ofﬁce,
                 too. It’s more than an effusion of seasonal spirit,
                 of course, that impels suppliers to shower gifts on
                 purchasing departments at holiday time. In 1996,
                 purchasing managers admitted to an interviewer
                 from Inc. magazine that after having accepted a gift
                                                 19

H7290-Influence.indd 19 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

              from a supplier, they were willing to purchase prod-
              ucts and services they would have otherwise de-
              clined. Gifts also have a startling effect on retention.
              I have encouraged readers of my book to send me
              examples of the principles of inﬂuence at work
              in their own lives. One reader, an employee of the
              State of Oregon, sent a letter in which she offered
              these reasons for her commitment to her supervisor:

                  He gives me and my son gifts for Christmas and
                  gives me presents on my birthday. There is no
                  promotion for the type of job I have, and my only
                  choice for one is to move to another department.
                  But I ﬁnd myself resisting trying to move. My boss
                  is reaching retirement age, and I am thinking I
                  will be able to move out after he retires . . . [F]or
                  now, I feel obligated to stay since he has been so
                  nice to me.

                  Ultimately, though, gift giving is one of the cruder
              applications of the rule of reciprocity. In its more so-
                                           20

H7290-Influence.indd 20 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Harnessing the Science of Persuasion

                 phisticated uses, it confers a genuine ﬁrst-mover ad-
                 vantage on any manager who is trying to foster posi-
                 tive attitudes and productive personal relationships
                 in the ofﬁce: Managers can elicit the desired behavior
                 from coworkers and employees by displaying it ﬁrst.
                 Whether it’s a sense of trust, a spirit of cooperation,
                 or a pleasant demeanor, leaders should model the be-
                 havior they want to see from others.
                     The same holds true for managers faced with is-
                 sues of information delivery and resource allocation.
                 If you lend a member of your staff to a colleague who
                 is shorthanded and staring at a fast-approaching
                 deadline, you will signiﬁcantly increase your chances
                 of getting help when you need it. Your odds will im-
                 prove even more if you say, when your colleague
                 thanks you for the assistance, something like, “Sure,
                 glad to help. I know how important it is for me to
                 count on your help when I need it.”
                                              21

                     The principle of social proof:
                People follow the lead of similar others.

                          The application: Use peer power
                              whenever it’s available.

              Social creatures that they are, human beings rely
              heavily on the people around them for cues on how
              to think, feel, and act. We know this intuitively, but
              intuition has also been conﬁrmed by experiments,
              such as the one ﬁrst described in 1982 in the Journal
              of Applied Psychology. A group of researchers went
              door-to-door in Columbia, South Carolina, soliciting
              donations for a charity campaign and displaying a list
              of neighborhood residents who had already donated
              to the cause. The researchers found that the longer
              the donor list was, the more likely those solicited
              would be to donate as well.
                  To the people being solicited, the friends’ and
              neighbors’ names on the list were a form of social
                                          22

H7290-Influence.indd 22 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Harnessing the Science of Persuasion

                 evidence about how they should respond. But the evi-
                 dence would not have been nearly as compelling had
                 the names been those of random strangers. In an ex-
                 periment from the 1960s, ﬁrst described in the Jour-
                 nal of Personality and Social Psychology, residents of
                 New York City were asked to return a lost wallet to
                 its owner. They were highly likely to attempt to re-
                 turn the wallet when they learned that another New
                 Yorker had previously attempted to do so. But learn-
                 ing that someone from a foreign country had tried to
                 return the wallet didn’t sway their decision one way
                 or the other.
                     The lesson for executives from these two experi-
                 ments is that persuasion can be extremely effective
                 when it comes from peers. The science supports what
                 most sales professionals already know: Testimonials
                 from satisﬁed customers work best when the satisﬁed
                 customer and the prospective customer share similar
                 circumstances. That lesson can help a manager faced
                 with the task of selling a new corporate initiative.

              Imagine that you’re trying to streamline your depart-
              ment’s work processes. A group of veteran employees
              is resisting. Rather than try to convince the employ-
              ees of the move’s merits yourself, ask an old-timer
              who supports the initiative to speak up for it at a team
              meeting. The compatriot’s testimony stands a much
              better chance of convincing the group than yet an-
              other speech from the boss. Stated simply, inﬂuence is
              often best exerted horizontally rather than vertically.
                          The principle of consistency:
                             People align with their
                              clear commitments.

                     The application: Make their commitments
                           active, public, and voluntary.

              Liking is a powerful force, but the work of persuasion
              involves more than simply making people feel warmly

                 toward you, your idea, or your product. People need
                 not only to like you but to feel committed to what you
                 want them to do. Good turns are one reliable way to
                 make people feel obligated to you. Another is to win a
                 public commitment from them.
                     My own research has demonstrated that most peo-
                 ple, once they take a stand or go on record in favor of
                 a position, prefer to stick to it. Other studies reinforce
                 that ﬁnding and go on to show how even a small,
                 seemingly trivial commitment can have a powerful
                 effect on future actions. Israeli researchers writing in
                 1983 in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulle-
                 tin recounted how they asked half the residents of a
                 large apartment complex to sign a petition favoring
                 the establishment of a recreation center for the hand-
                 icapped. The cause was good and the request was
                 small, so almost everyone who was asked agreed to
                 sign. Two weeks later, on National Collection Day for
                 the Handicapped, all residents of the complex were
                 approached at home and asked to give to the cause.
                                              25

H7290-Influence.indd 25 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

              A little more than half of those who were not asked
              to sign the petition made a contribution. But an as-
              tounding 92% of those who did sign donated money.
              The residents of the apartment complex felt obligated
              to live up to their commitments because those com-
              mitments were active, public, and voluntary. These
              three features are worth considering separately.
                  There’s strong empirical evidence to show that a
              choice made actively—one that’s spoken out loud or
              written down or otherwise made explicit—is consid-
              erably more likely to direct someone’s future conduct
              than the same choice left unspoken. Writing in 1996
              in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,
              Delia Ciofﬁ and Randy Garner described an experi-
              ment in which college students in one group were
              asked to ﬁll out a printed form saying they wished to
              volunteer for an AIDS education project in the pub-
              lic schools. Students in another group volunteered
              for the same project by leaving blank a form stating
              that they didn’t want to participate. A few days later,
                                         26

H7290-Influence.indd 26 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Harnessing the Science of Persuasion

                 when the volunteers reported for duty, 74% of those
                 who showed up were students from the group that
                 signaled their commitment by ﬁlling out the form.
                     The implications are clear for a manager who
                 wants to persuade a subordinate to follow some par-
                 ticular course of action: Get it in writing. Let’s sup-
                 pose you want your employee to submit reports in
                 a more timely fashion. Once you believe you’ve won
                 agreement, ask him to summarize the decision in a
                 memo and send it to you. By doing so, you’ll have
                 greatly increased the odds that he’ll fulﬁll the com-
                 mitment because, as a rule, people live up to what
                 they have written down.
                     Research into the social dimensions of commit-
                 ment suggests that written statements become even
                 more powerful when they’re made public. In a clas-
                 sic experiment, described in 1955 in the Journal of
                 Abnormal and Social Psychology, college students
                 were asked to estimate the length of lines projected
                 on a screen. Some students were asked to write down
                                             27

H7290-Influence.indd 27 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

              their choices on a piece of paper, sign it, and hand the
              paper to the experimenter. Others wrote their choices
              on an erasable slate, then erased the slate immedi-
              ately. Still others were instructed to keep their deci-
              sions to themselves.
                  The experimenters then presented all three groups
              with evidence that their initial choices may have been
              wrong. Those who had merely kept their decisions in
              their heads were the most likely to reconsider their
              original estimates. More loyal to their ﬁrst guesses
              were the students in the group that had written them
              down and immediately erased them. But by a wide
              margin, the ones most reluctant to shift from their
              original choices were those who had signed and
              handed them to the researcher.
                  This experiment highlights how much most people
              wish to appear consistent to others. Consider again
              the matter of the employee who has been submitting
              late reports. Recognizing the power of this desire,
              you should, once you’ve successfully convinced him
                                         28

H7290-Influence.indd 28 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Harnessing the Science of Persuasion

                 of the need to be more timely, reinforce the commit-
                 ment by making sure it gets a public airing. One way
                 to do that would be to send the employee an email
                 that reads, “I think your plan is just what we need.
                 I showed it to Diane in manufacturing and Phil in
                 shipping, and they thought it was right on target,
                 too.” Whatever way such commitments are formal-
                 ized, they should never be like the New Year’s resolu-
                 tions people privately make and then abandon with
                 no one the wiser. They should be publicly made and
                 visibly posted.
                     More than 300 years ago, Samuel Butler wrote a
                 couplet that explains succinctly why commitments
                 must be voluntary to be lasting and effective: “He that
                 complies against his will/Is of his own opinion still.”
                 If an undertaking is forced, coerced, or imposed from
                 the outside, it’s not a commitment; it’s an unwel-
                 come burden. Think how you would react if your boss
                 pressured you to donate to the campaign of a politi-
                 cal candidate. Would that make you more apt to opt
                                              29

H7290-Influence.indd 29 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

              for that candidate in the privacy of a voting booth?
              Not likely. In fact, in their 1981 book Psychological
              Reactance (Academic Press), Sharon S. Brehm and
              Jack W. Brehm present data that suggest you’d vote
              the opposite way just to express your resentment of
              the boss’s coercion.
                  This kind of backlash can occur in the ofﬁce, too.
              Let’s return again to that tardy employee. If you
              want to produce an enduring change in his behav-
              ior, you should avoid using threats or pressure tactics
              to gain his compliance. He’d likely view any change
              in his behavior as the result of intimidation rather
              than a personal commitment to change. A better
              approach would be to identify something that the
              employee genuinely values in the workplace—high-
              quality workmanship, perhaps, or team spirit—and
              then describe how timely reports are consistent with
              those values. That gives the employee reasons for
              improvement that he can own. And because he owns
              them, they’ll continue to guide his behavior even
              when you’re not watching.

                              The principle of authority:
                               People defer to experts.

                          The application: Expose your expertise;
                               don’t assume it’s self-evident.

                 Two thousand years ago, the Roman poet Virgil of-
                 fered this simple counsel to those seeking to choose
                 correctly: “Believe an expert.” That may or may not
                 be good advice, but as a description of what people
                 actually do, it can’t be beaten. For instance, when the
                 news media present an acknowledged expert’s views
                 on a topic, the effect on public opinion is dramatic.
                 A single expert-opinion news story in the New York
                 Times is associated with a 2% shift in public opinion
                 nationwide, according to a 1993 study described
                 in the Public Opinion Quarterly. And researchers
                 writing in the American Political Science Review in
                 1987 found that when the expert’s view was aired on
                 national television, public opinion shifted as much
                 as 4%. A cynic might argue that these ﬁndings only
                                                31

              illustrate the docile submissiveness of the public.
              But a fairer explanation is that, amid the teeming
              complexity of contemporary life, a well-selected ex-
              pert offers a valuable and efﬁcient shortcut to good
              decisions. Indeed, some questions, be they legal, ﬁ-
              nancial, medical, or technological, require so much
              specialized knowledge to answer, we have no choice
              but to rely on experts.
                  Since there’s good reason to defer to experts, ex-
              ecutives should take pains to ensure that they estab-
              lish their own expertise before they attempt to exert
              inﬂuence. Surprisingly often, people mistakenly as-
              sume that others recognize and appreciate their ex-
              perience. That’s what happened at a hospital where
              some colleagues and I were consulting. The physical
              therapy staffers were frustrated because so many of
              their stroke patients abandoned their exercise rou-
              tines as soon as they left the hospital. No matter how
              often the staff emphasized the importance of regular
              home exercise—it is, in fact, crucial to the process of
                                         32

H7290-Influence.indd 32 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Harnessing the Science of Persuasion

                 regaining independent function—the message just
                 didn’t sink in.
                     Interviews with some of the patients helped us
                 pinpoint the problem. They were familiar with the
                 background and training of their physicians, but the
                 patients knew little about the credentials of the phy-
                 sical therapists who were urging them to exercise. It
                 was a simple matter to remedy that lack of informa-
                 tion: We merely asked the therapy director to display
                 all the awards, diplomas, and certiﬁcations of her
                 staff on the walls of the therapy rooms. The result
                 was startling: Exercise compliance jumped 34% and
                 has never dropped since.
                     What we found immensely gratifying was not just
                 how much we increased compliance, but how. We
                 didn’t fool or browbeat any of the patients. We in-
                 formed them into compliance. Nothing had to be in-
                 vented; no time or resources had to be spent in the
                 process. The staff ’s expertise was real—all we had to
                 do was make it more visible.

                  The task for managers who want to establish their
              claims to expertise is somewhat more difﬁcult. They
              can’t simply nail their diplomas to the wall and wait
              for everyone to notice. A little subtlety is called for.
              Outside the United States, it is customary for people
              to spend time interacting socially before getting down
              to business for the ﬁrst time. Frequently they gather
              for dinner the night before their meeting or negotia-
              tion. These get-togethers can make discussions easier
              and help blunt disagreements—remember the ﬁnd-
              ings about liking and similarity—and they can also
              provide an opportunity to establish expertise. Per-
              haps it’s a matter of telling an anecdote about suc-
              cessfully solving a problem similar to the one that’s
              on the agenda at the next day’s meeting. Or perhaps
              dinner is the time to describe years spent mastering a
              complex discipline—not in a boastful way but as part
              of the ordinary give-and-take of conversation.
                  Granted, there’s not always time for lengthy in-
              troductory sessions. But even in the course of the
                                         34

                    Thanks to several decades of rigorous empirical re-
                    search by behavioral scientists, our understanding
                    of the how and why of persuasion has never been
                    broader, deeper, or more detailed. But these scien-
                    tists aren’t the ﬁrst students of the subject. The his-
                    tory of persuasion studies is an ancient and honorable
                    one, and it has generated a long roster of heroes and
                    martyrs.
                          A renowned student of social inﬂuence, William
                    McGuire, contends in a chapter of the Handbook
                    of Social Psychology, 3rd edition (Oxford University
                    Press, 1985), that scattered among the more than
                    four millennia of recorded Western history are four
                    centuries in which the study of persuasion ﬂourished
                    as a craft. The ﬁrst was the Periclean Age of ancient
                    Athens, the second occurred during the years of the
                                                                        (Continued)

                 Roman Republic, the next appeared in the time of the
                 European Renaissance, and the last extended over the
                 hundred years that have just ended, which witnessed
                 the advent of large-scale advertising, information,
                 and mass media campaigns. Each of the three pre-
                 vious centuries of systematic persuasion study was
                 marked by a ﬂowering of human achievement that
                 was suddenly cut short when political authorities had
                 the masters of persuasion killed. The philosopher Soc-
                 rates is probably the best known of the persuasion ex-
                 perts to run afoul of the powers that be.
                     Information about the persuasion process is a
                 threat because it creates a base of power entirely sep-
                 arate from the one controlled by political authorities.
                 Faced with a rival source of inﬂuence, rulers in previ-
                 ous centuries had few qualms about eliminating those
                                           36

                    rare individuals who truly understood how to marshal
                    forces that heads of state have never been able to
                    monopolize, such as cleverly crafted language, stra-
                    tegically placed information, and, most important,
                    psychological insight.
                          It would perhaps be expressing too much faith in
                    human nature to claim that persuasion experts no lon-
                    ger face a threat from those who wield political power.
                    But because the truth about persuasion is no longer
                    the sole possession of a few brilliant, inspired indi-
                    viduals, experts in the ﬁeld can presumably breathe
                    a little easier. Indeed, since most people in power are
                    interested in remaining in power, they’re likely to be
                    more interested in acquiring persuasion skills than
                    abolishing them.

              preliminary conversation that precedes most meet-
              ings, there is almost always an opportunity to touch
              lightly on your relevant background and experience
              as a natural part of a sociable exchange. This initial
              disclosure of personal information gives you a chance
              to establish expertise early in the game, so that when
              the discussion turns to the business at hand, what you
              have to say will be accorded the respect it deserves.
                           The principle of scarcity:
                          People want more of what
                            they can have less of.

                     The application: Highlight unique beneﬁts
                            and exclusive information.

              Study after study shows that items and opportuni-
              ties are seen to be more valuable as they become less
              available. That’s a tremendously useful piece of in-
                                          38

                 formation for managers. They can harness the scar-
                 city principle with the organizational equivalents of
                 limited-time, limited-supply, and one-of-a-kind of-
                 fers. Honestly informing a coworker of a closing win-
                 dow of opportunity—the chance to get the boss’s ear
                 before she leaves for an extended vacation, perhaps—
                 can mobilize action dramatically.
                     Managers can learn from retailers how to frame
                 their offers not in terms of what people stand to
                 gain but in terms of what they stand to lose if they
                 don’t act on the information. The power of “loss lan-
                 guage” was demonstrated in a 1988 study of Califor-
                 nia homeowners written up in the Journal of Applied
                 Psychology. Half were told that if they fully insu-
                 lated their homes, they would save a certain amount
                 of money each day. The other half were told that if
                 they failed to insulate, they would lose that amount
                 each day. Signiﬁcantly more people insulated their
                 homes when exposed to the loss language. The same
                 phenomenon occurs in business. According to a 1994
                                             39

H7290-Influence.indd 39 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

              study in the journal Organizational Behavior and
              Human Decision Processes, potential losses ﬁgure far
              more heavily in managers’ decision making than po-
              tential gains.
                  In framing their offers, executives should also re-
              member that exclusive information is more persua-
              sive than widely available data. A doctoral student of
              mine, Amram Knishinsky, wrote his 1982 disserta-
              tion on the purchase decisions of wholesale beef buy-
              ers. He observed that they more than doubled their
              orders when they were told that, because of certain
              weather conditions overseas, there was likely to be a
              scarcity of foreign beef in the near future. But their
              orders increased 600% when they were informed
              that no one else had that information yet.
                  The persuasive power of exclusivity can be har-
              nessed by any manager who comes into possession
              of information that’s not broadly available and that
              supports an idea or initiative he or she would like the
                                          40

H7290-Influence.indd 40 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Harnessing the Science of Persuasion

                 organization to adopt. The next time that kind of in-
                 formation crosses your desk, round up your organi-
                 zation’s key players. The information itself may seem
                 dull, but exclusivity will give it a special sheen. Push it
                 across your desk and say, “I just got this report today.
                 It won’t be distributed until next week, but I want to
                 give you an early look at what it shows.” Then watch
                 your listeners lean forward.
                     Allow me to stress here a point that should be
                 obvious. No offer of exclusive information, no ex-
                 hortation to act now or miss this opportunity for-
                 ever should be made unless it is genuine. Deceiv-
                 ing colleagues into compliance is not only ethically
                 objectionable, it’s foolhardy. If the deception is de-
                 tected—and it certainly will be—it will snuff out any
                 enthusiasm the offer originally kindled. It will also
                 invite dishonesty toward the deceiver. Remember the
                 rule of reciprocity.

                             Putting it all together

              There’s nothing abstruse or obscure about these
              six principles of persuasion. Indeed, they neatly
              codify our intuitive understanding of the ways peo-
              ple evaluate information and form decisions. As
              a result, the principles are easy for most people to
              grasp, even those with no formal education in psy-
              chology. But in the seminars and workshops I con-
              duct, I have learned that two points bear repeated
              emphasis.
                  First, although the six principles and their applica-
              tions can be discussed separately for the sake of clar-
              ity, they should be applied in combination to com-
              pound their impact. For instance, in discussing the
              importance of expertise, I suggested that managers
              use informal, social conversations to establish their
              credentials. But that conversation affords an oppor-
              tunity to gain information as well as convey it. While
                                          42

H7290-Influence.indd 42 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Harnessing the Science of Persuasion

                 you’re showing your dinner companion that you have
                 the skills and experience your business problem de-
                 mands, you can also learn about your companion’s
                 background, likes, and dislikes—information that
                 will help you locate genuine similarities and give sin-
                 cere compliments. By letting your expertise surface
                 and also establishing rapport, you double your per-
                 suasive power. And if you succeed in bringing your
                 dinner partner on board, you may encourage other
                 people to sign on as well, thanks to the persuasive
                 power of social evidence.
                     The other point I wish to emphasize is that the
                 rules of ethics apply to the science of social inﬂuence
                 just as they do to any other technology. Not only is
                 it ethically wrong to trick or trap others into assent,
                 it’s ill-advised in practical terms. Dishonest or high-
                 pressure tactics work only in the short run, if at all.
                 Their long-term effects are malignant, especially
                 within an organization that can’t function properly
                 without a bedrock level of trust and cooperation.

                  That point is made vividly in the following account,
              which a department head for a large textile manu-
              facturer related at a training workshop I conducted.
              She described a vice president in her company who
              wrung public commitments from department heads
              in a highly manipulative manner. Instead of giving
              his subordinates time to talk or think through his
              proposals carefully, he would approach them in-
              dividually at the busiest moment of their workday
              and describe the beneﬁts of his plan in exhaustive,
              patience-straining detail. Then he would move in for
              the kill. “It’s very important for me to see you as being
              on my team on this,” he would say. “Can I count on
              your support?” Intimidated, frazzled, eager to chase
              the man from their ofﬁces so they could get back
              to work, the department heads would invariably go
              along with his request. But because the commitments
              never felt voluntary, the department heads never fol-
              lowed through, and as a result the vice president’s
              initiatives all blew up or petered out.

H7290-Influence.indd 44 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Harnessing the Science of Persuasion

                     This story had a deep impact on the other par-
                 ticipants in the workshop. Some gulped in shock as
                 they recognized their own manipulative behavior.
                 But what stopped everyone cold was the expression
                 on the department head’s face as she recounted the
                 damaging collapse of her superior’s proposals. She
                 was smiling.
                     Nothing I could say would more effectively make
                 the point that the deceptive or coercive use of the
                 principles of social inﬂuence is ethically wrong and
                 pragmatically wrongheaded. Yet the same principles,
                 if applied appropriately, can steer decisions correctly.
                 Legitimate expertise, genuine obligations, authentic
                 similarities, real social proof, exclusive news, and
                 freely made commitments can produce choices that
                 are likely to beneﬁt both parties. And any approach
                 that works to everyone’s mutual beneﬁt is good busi-
                 ness, don’t you think? Of course, I don’t want to press
                 you into it, but, if you agree, I would love it if you
                 could just jot me a memo to that effect.

That's the question we constantly get from new managers, only weeks or months into their positions, when we describe the three key activities they should be focusing on to be success- ful as leaders: building trust, building a team, and building a broader network. To their dismay, most of them have found they rarely end a day in their new positions having done what they planned to do. They spend most of their time solving unexpected prob- lems and making sure their groups do their work on time, on budget, and up to standard. They feel des- perately out of control because what's urgent---the

              daily work—always seems to highjack what’s impor-
              tant—their ongoing work as managers and leaders.
                  So they push back because they think we’ve just
              made their to-do list even longer. And these key
              elements (we call them the “Three Imperatives of
              Leading and Managing”) are not quick and easy
              wins—they are substantial and fundamental to one’s
              ability to function effectively as a leader. Here’s why:

                  • Building trust. Successful leadership is, at root,
                      about inﬂuencing others, and trust is the foun-
                      dation of all ability to inﬂuence others. You can-
                      not inﬂuence anyone who does not trust you.
                      Thus the manager must work to cultivate the
                      trust of everyone they work with. They do this
                      by demonstrating the two basic components
                      of trust: competence and character. Compe-
                      tence doesn’t mean being the resident expert in
                      everything the group does; it does mean under-
                      standing the work well enough to make solid
                      decisions about it and having the courage to ask

                                           50

H7290-Influence.indd 50 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Three Things Managers Should Be Doing Every Day

                          questions where they may be less knowledge-
                          able. Character means basing decisions and ac-
                          tions on values that go beyond self-interest and
                          truly caring about the work, about the custom-
                          ers (internal or external) for whom they do the
                          work, and about the people doing the work. If
                          people believe in your competence and charac-
                          ter, they will trust you to do the right thing.

                     • Building a real team and managing through
                          it. An effective team is bound together by a
                          common, compelling purpose, based on shared
                          values. In a genuine team, the bonds among
                          members are so strong that they truly believe
                          they will all succeed or fail together and that
                          no individual can win if the team loses. Be-
                          sides purpose and values, strong teams also
                          have rules of engagement: explicit and im-
                          plicit understandings of how members work
                          together. For example, what kinds of conﬂict
                          are allowed, and what kinds are not? Smart

                                                  51

H7290-Influence.indd 51 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                      leaders make sure all the elements that create a
                      real team are in place—purpose, values, rules—
                      and then manage through the team. So instead
                      of saying, “Do it because I’m the boss,” they
                      say, “Do it for the team,” which is a much more
                      powerful approach. In a real team, members
                      value their membership and strive mightily not
                      to let their comrades down. The smart leader
                      builds and uses these powerful ties to shape
                      behavior.

                  • Building a network. Every team depends on
                      the support and collaboration of outside people
                      and groups. Effective group leaders proactively
                      build and maintain a network of these outsid-
                      ers, which includes not just those needed for
                      today’s work but also those the group will need
                      to achieve future goals. This is without a doubt
                      the imperative that most troubles new manag-

                          organizational politicking that requires them to
                          pretend they like people just because they want
                          something from them. They strive to be above
                          that sort of thing. Alas, in the process, they
                          unnecessarily limit their own and their group’s
                          ability to inﬂuence others for good ends. Build-
                          ing a network can be politicking, but it need
                          not be if they do it honestly, openly, and with
                          the genuine intent of creating relationships that
                          beneﬁt both sides.

                     It is here, after covering these imperatives, that we
                 hear the question, “When are we supposed to build
                 trust, build a team, and create a network? How do we
                 do that on top of everything else we have to do?”
                     Our answer is that the “Three Imperatives” and all
                 that each embodies are not discrete tasks to put on a
                 to-do. Instead, strong, effective leaders manage and
                 lead through the daily work. They do this in the way
                 they deﬁne, assign, structure, talk about, review, and
                                                  53

              generally guide that work. They are masters at using
              the daily work and its inevitable crises to perform
              their work as managers and leaders.
                  How do they do this?
                  They build trust by taking the opportunity to dem-
              onstrate their ability as they do their daily work, by
              asking knowledgeable questions and offering insight-
              ful suggestions. They use daily decisions and choices
              to illustrate their own values, expressing their concern
              for those who work for them or those for whom the
              group does its work. They reveal themselves, but not
              in an egotistical way, showing what they know, what
              they believe, and what they value—and in doing this,
              they show themselves to be trustworthy.
                  They build a team by using problems and crises in
              the daily work to remind members of the team’s pur-
              pose and what it values most. They explain their deci-
              sions in these terms. They immediately call out team
              members who violate a rule of engagement—treating
              each other disrespectfully, for example—or who place
                                         54

H7290-Influence.indd 54 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Three Things Managers Should Be Doing Every Day

                 their interests above those of the team. And since the
                 rules apply to all members, including the leader, they
                 ask team members to hold the leader accountable if
                 she ever forgets one of those rules.
                     They build a network by taking opportunities af-
                 forded by routine activities—a regular meeting of
                 department heads, for example, or even a chance
                 meeting in the elevator—to build and maintain rela-
                 tionships with colleagues outside their group. They
                 consciously approach problems that involve another
                 group leader in a way that both solves the problem
                 and fosters a long-term relationship. They proactively
                 share information with outsiders who would beneﬁt
                 from it. They encourage their group members to take
                 the same approach when they deal with outsiders.
                     These are obviously only a few of the ways good
                 managers use their daily work to fulﬁll the deeper im-
                 peratives of leadership, but you get the idea. In fact, if
                 there’s anything that might be called a “secret” for not
                 getting overwhelmed by the challenges of becoming
                                                55

              an effective manager, this is surely it. We’ve seen new
              managers light up when they ﬁnally grasp this prin-
              ciple: that the daily work isn’t an impediment to do-
              ing what good leaders do. Instead, it’s the way, the
              vehicle, to do most of what good managers do.
                  Once they learn this lesson, they look at their daily
              work differently. For every new task, for every unex-
              pected problem, they take a moment to step back and
              ask, How can I use this to foster trust? To build
              and strengthen us as a team? To expand our network
              and make it stronger?

Bill walks into a meeting after a failed product launch to greet an exhausted and demotivated team that desperately needs his direction. Robin gets ready to confront a brilliant but underperforming subordinate who needs to be put back on track. We've all been in situations like these. What they require is charisma---the ability to communicate a clear, visionary, and inspirational message that capti- vates and motivates an audience. So how do you learn charisma? Many people believe that it's impossible.

              They say that charismatic people are born that way—
              as naturally expressive and persuasive extroverts.
              After all, you can’t teach someone to be Winston
              Churchill.
                  While we agree with the latter contention, we dis-
              agree with the former. Charisma is not all innate; it’s
              a learnable skill or, rather, a set of skills that have
              been practiced since antiquity. Our research with
              managers in the laboratory and in the ﬁeld indicates
              that anyone trained in what we call “charismatic
              leadership tactics” (CLTs) can become more inﬂu-
              ential, trustworthy, and “leader like” in the eyes of
              others. In this article we’ll explain these tactics and
              how we help managers master them. Just as athletes
              rely on hard training and the right game plan to win
              a competition, leaders who want to become charis-
              matic must study the CLTs, practice them religiously,
              and have a good deployment strategy.

                                What is charisma?

                 Charisma is rooted in values and feelings. It’s inﬂu-
                 ence born of the alchemy that Aristotle called the
                 logos, the ethos, and the pathos; that is, to persuade
                 others, you must use powerful and reasoned rheto-
                 ric, establish personal and moral credibility, and then
                 rouse followers’ emotions and passions. If a leader can
                 do those three things well, he or she can then tap into
                 the hopes and ideals of followers, give them a sense
                 of purpose, and inspire them to achieve great things.
                     Several large-scale studies have shown that cha-
                 risma can be an invaluable asset in any work con-
                 text—small or large, public or private, Western or
                 Asian. Politicians know that it’s important. Yet many
                 business managers don’t use charisma, perhaps be-
                 cause they don’t know how to or because they believe
                 it’s not as easy to master as transactional (carrot-and-
                 stick) or instrumental (task-based) leadership. Let’s
                                            61

H7290-Influence.indd 61 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

              be clear: Leaders need technical expertise to win the
              trust of followers, manage operations, and set strat-
              egy; they also beneﬁt from the ability to punish and
              reward. But the most effective leaders layer charis-
              matic leadership on top of transactional and instru-
              mental leadership to achieve their goals.
                  In our research, we have identiﬁed a dozen key
              CLTs. Some of them you may recognize as long-
              standing techniques of oratory. Nine of them are ver-
              bal: metaphors, similes, and analogies; stories and
              anecdotes; contrasts; rhetorical questions; three-part
              lists; expressions of moral conviction; reﬂections
              of the group’s sentiments; the setting of high goals;
              and conveying conﬁdence that they can be achieved.
              Three tactics are nonverbal: animated voice, facial
              expressions, and gestures.
                  There are other CLTs that leaders can use—such
              as creating a sense of urgency, invoking history, using
              repetition, talking about sacriﬁce, and using humor—
              but the 12 described in this article are the ones that
                                         62

                 have the greatest effect and can work in almost any
                 context. In studies and experiments, we have found
                 that people who use them appropriately can unite fol-
                 lowers around a vision in a way that others can’t. In 8
                 of the past 10 U.S. presidential races, for instance, the
                 candidate who deployed verbal CLTs more often won.
                 And when we measured “good” presentation skills—
                 such as speech structure, clear pronunciation, use of
                 easy-to-understand language, tempo of speech, and
                 speaker comfort—and compared their impact against
                 that of the CLTs, we found that the CLTs played a
                 much bigger role in determining who was perceived
                 to be more leader like, competent, and trustworthy.
                     Still, these tactics don’t seem to be widely known
                 or taught in the business world. The managers who
                 practice them typically learned them by trial and er-
                 ror, without thinking consciously about them. As one
                 manager who attended our training remarked, “I use
                 a lot of these tactics, some without even knowing it.”
                 Such learning should not be left to chance.
                                            63

H7290-Influence.indd 63 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                  We teach managers the CLTs by outlining the
              concepts and then showing news and ﬁlm clips that
              highlight examples from business, sports, and poli-
              tics. Managers must then experiment with and prac-
              tice the tactics—on video, in front of peers, and on
              their own. A group of midlevel European executives
              (with an average age of 35) that did so as part of our
              training almost doubled their use of CLTs in presen-
              tations. As a result, they saw observers’ numerical
              ratings of their competence as leaders jump by about
              60% on average. They were then able to take the tac-
              tics back to their jobs. We saw the same thing happen
              with another group of executives (with an average
              age of 42) in a large Swiss ﬁrm. Overall, we’ve found
              that about 65% of people who have been trained in
              the CLTs receive above-average ratings as leaders, in
              contrast with only 35% of those who have not been
              trained.
                  The aim is to use the CLTs not only in public speak-
              ing but also in everyday conversations—to be more
                                          64

                 charismatic all the time. The tactics work because
                 they help you create an emotional connection with
                 followers, even as they make you appear more power-
                 ful, competent, and worthy of respect. In Greek, the
                 word “charisma” means special gift. Start to use the
                 CLTs correctly, and that’s what people will begin to
                 think you have.
                     Let’s now look at the tactics in detail.

                          Connect, compare, and contrast

                 Charismatic speakers help listeners understand, re-
                 late to, and remember a message. A powerful way to
                 do this is by using metaphors, similes, and analogies.
                 Martin Luther King Jr. was a master of the metaphor.
                 In his “I Have a Dream” speech, for example, he lik-
                 ened the U.S. Constitution to “a promissory note”
                 guaranteeing the unalienable rights of life, liberty,
                 and the pursuit of happiness to all people but noted
                                              65

              that America had instead given its black citizens “a
              bad check,” one that had come back marked “insuf-
              ﬁcient funds.” Everyone knows what it means to re-
              ceive a bad check. The message is crystal clear and
              easy to retain.
                  Metaphors can be effective in any professional
              context, too. Joe, a manager we worked with, used
              one to predispose his team to get behind an urgent
              relocation. He introduced it by saying, “When I heard
              about this from the board, it was like hearing about
              a long-awaited pregnancy. The difference is that we
              have four months instead of nine months to prepare.”
              The team instantly understood it was about to expe-
              rience an uncomfortable but ultimately rewarding
              transition.
                  Stories and anecdotes also make messages more
              engaging and help listeners connect with the speaker.
              Even people who aren’t born raconteurs can employ
              them in a compelling way. Take this example from
                                          66

                 a speech Bill Gates gave at Harvard, urging gradu-
                 ates to consider their broader responsibilities: “My
                 mother . . . never stopped pressing me to do more for
                 others. A few days before my wedding, she hosted a
                 bridal event, at which she read aloud a letter about
                 marriage that she had written to Melinda. My mother
                 was very ill with cancer at the time, but she saw one
                 more opportunity to deliver her message, and at the
                 close of the letter she [quoted]: ‘From those to whom
                 much is given, much is expected.’”
                     Lynn, another manager we studied, used the fol-
                 lowing story to motivate her reports during a crisis:
                 “This reminds me of the challenge my team and I
                 faced when climbing the Eiger peak a few years ago.
                 We got caught in bad weather, and we could have
                 died up there. But working together, we managed to
                 survive. And we made what at ﬁrst seemed impossi-
                 ble, possible. Today we are in an economic storm, but
                 by pulling together, we can turn this situation around
                                           67

              and succeed.” The story made her team feel reassured
              and inspired.
                  Contrasts are a key CLT because they combine rea-
              son and passion; they clarify your position by pitting
              it against the opposite, often to dramatic effect. Think
              of John F. Kennedy’s “Ask not what your country can
              do for you—ask what you can do for your country.” In
              our experience, contrasts are one of the easiest tac-
              tics to learn and use, and yet they aren’t used enough.
              Here are some examples from managers newly
              trained in the CLTs. Gilles, a senior VP, speaking to
              a direct report managing a stagnant team: “It seems
              to me that you’re playing too much defense when
              you need to be playing more offense.” (That’s also a
              metaphor.) And Sally, introducing herself to her new
              team: “I asked to lead the medical division not be-
              cause it has the best location but because I believe
              we can accomplish something great for our company
              and at the same time help save lives.”

                                 Engage and distill

                 Rhetorical questions might seem hackneyed, but
                 charismatic leaders use them all the time to encour-
                 age engagement. Questions can have an obvious an-
                 swer or pose a puzzle to be answered later. Think
                 again of Martin Luther King Jr., who said, “There
                 are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights,
                 ‘When will you be satisﬁed?’” and then went on to
                 show that oppressed people can never be satisﬁed.
                 Anita Roddick—founder of the Body Shop—once
                 used three rhetorical questions to explain what led
                 her to help start the social responsibility movement.
                 The thinking, she said, “was really simple: How do
                 you make business kinder? How do you embed it in
                 the community? How do you make community a so-
                 cial purpose for business?”
                     This tactic works just as well in private conver-
                 sations. Take Mika, a manager in our study, who
                                            69

H7290-Influence.indd 69 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

              effectively motivated an underperforming subordi-
              nate by asking, “So, where do you want to go from
              here? Will it be back to your ofﬁce feeling sorry for
              yourself? Or do you want to show what you are ca-
              pable of achieving?” Here’s another question (also
              employing metaphor) used by Frank, an IT execu-
              tive who needed to push back at the unrealistic goals
              being set for him: “How can you expect me to change
              an engine in a plane midﬂight?”
                  Three-part lists are another old trick of effective
              persuasion because they distill any message into key
              takeaways. Why three? Because most people can re-
              member three things, three is sufﬁcient to provide
              proof of a pattern, and three gives an impression of
              completeness. Three-part lists can be announced—as
              in “There are three things we need to do to get our
              bottom line back into the black”—or they can be un-
              der the radar, as in the sentence before this one.
                  Here’s a list that Serge, a midlevel manager, used
              at a team meeting: “We have the best product on the
                                          70

H7290-Influence.indd 70 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Learning Charisma

                 market. We have the best team. Yet we did not make
                 the sales target.” And here’s one that Karin, division
                 head of a manufacturing company, employed in a
                 speech to her staff: “We can turn this around with a
                 three-point strategy: First, we need to look back and
                 see what we did right. Next, we need to see where we
                 went wrong. Then, we need to come up with a plan
                 that will convince the board to give us the resources
                 to get it right the next time.”

                     Show integrity, authority, and passion

                 Expressions of moral conviction and statements that
                 reﬂect the sentiments of the group—even when the
                 sentiments are negative—establish your credibility by
                 revealing the quality of your character to your listen-
                 ers and making them identify and align themselves
                 with you. On Victory Day at the end of the Second
                 World War, Winston Churchill brilliantly captured
                                             71

              the feelings of the British people and also conveyed
              a spirit of honor, courage, and compassion. He said:
              “This is your hour. This is not victory of a party or of
              any class. It’s a victory of the great British nation as
              a whole. We were the ﬁrst, in this ancient island, to
              draw the sword against tyranny. . . . There we stood,
              alone. The lights went out and the bombs came down.
              But every man, woman, and child in the country had
              no thought of quitting the struggle. . . . Now we have
              emerged from one deadly struggle—a terrible foe has
              been cast on the ground and awaits our judgment
              and our mercy.”
                  Another nice example of moral conviction (plus
              a number of other CLTs) comes from Tina, a man-
              ager in an NGO pushing for a needed supply-chain
              change: “Who do you think will pay for the logistical
              mess we’ve created? It is not our donors who’ll feel
              it but the children we’re supposed to be feeding that
              will go to bed one more time with an empty belly and
              who may not make it through the night. Apart from
                                          72

H7290-Influence.indd 72 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Learning Charisma

                 wasting money, this is not right, especially because
                 the ﬁx is so simple.” And here’s Rami, a senior IT
                 director trained in the CLTs, expertly reﬂecting the
                 sentiments of his disheartened team: “I know what
                 is going through your minds, because the same thing
                 is going through mine. We all feel disappointed and
                 demotivated. Some of you have told me you have had
                 sleepless nights; others, that there are tensions in the
                 team, even at home because of this. Personally, life to
                 me has become dull and tasteless. I know how hard
                 we have all worked and the bitterness we feel because
                 success just slipped out of our reach. But it’s not go-
                 ing to be like this for much longer. I have a plan.”
                     Another CLT, which helps charismatic leaders
                 demonstrate passion—and inspire it in their follow-
                 ers—is setting high goals. Gandhi set the almost im-
                 possible (and moral) goal of liberating India from
                 British rule without using violence, as laid out in his
                 famous “quit India” speech. An example from the
                 business world that we often cite is the former CEO
                                            73

H7290-Influence.indd 73 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

              of Sharp, Katsuhiko Machida. In 1998, at a time
              when Sharp faced collapse, cathode-ray tubes domi-
              nated the TV market, and the idea of using LCD
              technology was commercially unviable, he energized
              his employees by stating the unthinkable: “By 2005,
              all TVs we sell in Japan will be LCD models.”
                  But one must also convey conﬁdence that the goals
              can be achieved. Gandhi noted: “I know the British
              Government will not be able to withhold freedom
              from us, when we have made enough self-sacriﬁce.”
              In a later speech he expressed his conviction more
              forcefully: “Even if all the United Nations opposes
              me, even if the whole of India forsakes me, I will say,
              ‘You are wrong. India will wrench with nonviolence
              her liberty from unwilling hands.’ I will go ahead not
              for India’s sake alone but for the sake of the world.
              Even if my eyes close before there is freedom, nonvio-
              lence will not end.” Machida personally took his vi-
              sion to Sharp’s engineers to convince them that they
              could realize his risky goal. He made it the company’s
                                         74

                 most important project, brought together cross-
                 functional teams from LCD and TV development to
                 work on it, and told them plainly that it was crucial to
                 Sharp’s survival. Or take Ray, an engineer we know,
                 addressing his team after a setback: “The deadline
                 the CEO gave us is daunting. Other teams would be
                 right to tremble at the knees, but we are not just an-
                 other team. I know you can rise to the challenge. I
                 believe in each one of you, which means that I believe
                 that we can get the prototype to manufacturing in
                 three months. Let’s commit to do what it takes to get
                 the job done: We have the smarts. We have the expe-
                 rience. All we need is the will, and that’s something
                 only great teams have.” Passion cannot emerge unless
                 the leader truly believes that the vision and strategic
                 goal can be reached.
                     The three nonverbal cues—expressions of voice,
                 body, and face—are also key to charisma. They don’t
                 come naturally to everyone, however, and they are
                 the most culturally sensitive tactics: What’s perceived
                                            75

H7290-Influence.indd 75 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

              as too much passion in certain Asian contexts might
              be perceived as too muted in southern European
              ones. But they are nonetheless important to learn
              and practice because they are easier for your follow-
              ers to process than the verbal CLTs, and they help you
              hold people’s attention by punctuating your speech.
              (For more on these, see the sidebar “Charisma in
              Voice and Body.”)

                          Putting it all into practice

              Now that you’ve learned the CLTs, how do you start
              using them? Simple: preparation and practice. When
              you’re mapping out a speech or a presentation, you
              should certainly plan to incorporate the tactics and
              rehearse them. We also encourage leaders to think
              about them before one-on-one conversations or team
              meetings in which they need to be persuasive. The
              idea is to arm yourself with a few key CLTs that feel
                                         76

H7290-Influence.indd 76 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Learning Charisma

                 comfortable to you and therefore will come out spon-
                 taneously—or at least look as if they did. The leaders
                 we’ve trained worked on improving their charisma in
                 groups and got feedback from one another. You could
                 ask your spouse or a friendly colleague to do the same
                 or videotape yourself and do a self-critique.
                     The goal isn’t to employ all the tactics in every con-
                 versation but to use a balanced combination. With
                 time and practice, they will start to come out on the
                 ﬂy. One manager we know, who met his wife after be-
                 ing trained in the CLTs, showed her his “before” vid-
                 eos and told us she couldn’t believe it was him. The
                 charismatic guy in the “after” videos—the one whose
                 CLT use had more than doubled—was the person she
                 had married. Another manager, who learned the tac-
                 tics six years ago and has since become the chief op-
                 erating ofﬁcer of his company, says he now uses them
                 every day—personally and professionally—such as
                 in a recent talk to his team about a relocation, which
                 went “much better than expected” as a result.

                              CHARISMA IN VOICE AND BODY

                 Three tactics for showing passion—and winning over
                 listeners.

                 Animated voice
                 People who are passionate vary the volume with
                 which they speak, whispering at appropriate points
                 or rising to a crescendo to hammer home a point.
                 Emotion—sadness, happiness, excitement, surprise—
                 must come through in the voice. Pauses are also im-
                 portant because they convey control.

                 Facial expressions
                 These help reinforce your message. Listeners need
                 to see as well as hear your passion—especially when
                 you’re telling a story or reﬂecting their sentiments.
                 So be sure to make eye contact (one of the givens of
                 charisma), and get comfortable smiling, frowning, and
                 laughing at work.
                                            78

H7290-Influence.indd 78 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Learning Charisma

                    Gestures
                    These are signals for your listeners. A ﬁst can reinforce
                    conﬁdence, power, and certitude. Waving a hand,
                    pointing, or pounding a desk can help draw attention.
                     If you think you can’t improve because you’re just
                 not naturally charismatic, you’re wrong. The man-
                 agers with the lowest initial charisma ratings in our
                 studies were able to signiﬁcantly narrow the gap be-
                 tween themselves and their peers to whom the tactics
                 came naturally. It’s true that no amount of training or
                 practice will turn you into Churchill or Martin Luther
                 King Jr. But the CLTs can make you more charismatic
                 in the eyes of your followers, and that will invariably
                 make you a more effective leader.

But it's essential to exercising inﬂuence. It's how method actors move us to feel, think, or act differently---they deeply immerse themselves in their characters, trying on new ways of being and behaving. Sometimes their identity experiments are even part of the story line, as in Being John Malko- vich, Avatar, and Tootsie. During Tootsie, walking in the shoes of a woman had such a profound impact on Dustin Hoffman that, 30 years later, recalling his decision to make the ﬁlm

              brought tears to his eyes in an interview with the
              American Film Institute.
                  Before agreeing to work on the movie, Hoffman
              did some makeup tests to see if he would be believ-
              able as a woman. When he discovered that he could
              pass, but he wouldn’t be beautiful, he realized he
              had to do this project. As he explained to his wife:
              “I think I’m an interesting woman [as Dorothy Mi-
              chaels]. And I know that if I met myself at a party,
              I wouldn’t talk to that character because she doesn’t
              fulﬁll physically the demands that we’re brought up
              to think women have to have in order for us to ask
              them out . . . There’s too many interesting women I
              have not had the experience to know in this life be-
              cause I’ve been brainwashed.” Empathy made Hoff-
              man’s performance—and the ﬁlm’s message—more
              convincing and powerful.
                  The same thing happens in business all the time.

                 you, persuading customers to buy your product, or
                 imploring the public to donate to your cause, your
                 success depends on your ability to grasp the wants
                 and needs of the people around you. We’ve seen this
                 over and over again at my ﬁrm as we’ve created pre-
                 sentations for clients and coached them on effec-
                 tive delivery. If people feel listened to, they become
                 more receptive to your message. And by doing the
                 listening, you become more informed about what
                 they really need—not just what you think they need—
                 which will fuel your relationships with stakeholders
                 over the long run.
                     How do you build your capacity for empathy?
                 Exercises can help, and they’re used in many ﬁelds.
                 Secret shoppers pose as retail customers and record
                 their observations. Product developers brainstorm
                 use cases and interview consumers to envision how
                 they’ll interact with a product. Negotiators do role-
                 playing to imagine opposing points of view before
                 they get to the table.

                  Once you’ve started to develop empathy as a skill,
              you can make it integral to the work you do. You
              might try visualizing stakeholders’ various perspec-
              tives the way Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and his team
              did. As described in a Fast Company post, they story-
              boarded the guest, host, and hiring processes—in-
              spired by Disney’s ﬁlmmaking. They created a list of
              the key moments in these three experiences and then
              developed the most important and most emotionally
              charged ones into fuller narratives. Cofounder Na-
              than Blecharczyk says they learned a lot: “What the
              storyboards made clear is that we were missing a big
              part of the picture. . . . There were a lot of important
              moments where we weren’t doing anything.” The
              storyboards ended up helping the company deﬁne
              its mobile strategy and even inspired new features,
              which allowed Airbnb to connect with traveling cus-
              tomers wherever the customers were.1
                  It’s also essential to listen carefully to your stake-
              holders and check your understanding of what’s be-
                                           86

                 ing said. Arbitrators do this to get a handle on what
                 both sides need in a dispute, before trying to carve
                 out a solution. Executives who are new to a com-
                 pany often embark on listening tours with employees
                 and customers to get their perspective on issues and
                 opportunities.
                     That’s what Lou Gerstner did in the 1990s, when
                 the board at IBM brought him in to turn around the
                 almost bankrupt company. Gerstner called his lis-
                 tening tour Operation Bear Hug. He gave managers
                 three months to meet with customers and ask about
                 issues they were grappling with and how IBM could
                 help. Managers then had to recap the conversations
                 in memos. Gerstner also called customers on his
                 own every day. And he “bear-hugged” employees by
                 touring IBM’s various sites and hosting gatherings
                 to share updates, test ideas, and tackle concerns. He
                 held 90-minute unscripted Q&A sessions with the
                 staff, during which he would talk to 20,000 workers
                 directly.

                  “I listened, and I tried very hard not to draw con-
              clusions,” Gerstner said.
                  It was an important step in the strategy-making
              process, one that enabled the executive team to build
              plans to make IBM relevant and competitive again.
              But it led to an even larger shift in IBM’s culture that
              transformed the company from an inwardly focused
              bureaucracy to a market-driven innovator.
                  Empathize with the people you need to persuade
              to purchase your product or services or to work hard
              on your behalf. It gives you better ideas, and it makes
              you worth listening to. And if your stakeholders can
              empathize with you in return, you’re on your way to
              building real, lasting relationships with them.

Customers must be convinced to buy your company's products or services, employees and colleagues to go along with a new strategic plan or reorganization, investors to buy (or not to sell) your stock, and partners to sign the next deal. But despite the critical importance of persuasion, most execu- tives struggle to communicate, let alone inspire. Too often, they get lost in the accoutrements of company- speak: PowerPoint slides, dry memos, and hyper- bolic missives from the corporate communications department. Even the most carefully researched and

              considered efforts are routinely greeted with cyni-
              cism, lassitude, or outright dismissal.
                  Why is persuasion so difﬁcult, and what can you
              do to set people on ﬁre? In search of answers to those
              questions, HBR senior editor Bronwyn Fryer paid a
              visit to Robert McKee, the world’s best known and
              most respected screenwriting lecturer, at his home
              in Los Angeles. An award-winning writer and direc-
              tor, McKee moved to California after studying for his
              PhD in cinema arts at the University of Michigan. He
              then taught at the University of Southern California’s
              School of Cinema and Television before forming his
              own company, Two Arts, to take his lectures on the
              art of storytelling worldwide to an audience of writ-
              ers, directors, producers, actors, and entertainment
              executives.
                  McKee’s students have written, directed, and
              produced hundreds of hit ﬁlms, including Forrest
              Gump, Erin Brockovich, The Color Purple, Gandhi,
              Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Sleepless in Se-
                                         94

                 attle, Toy Story, and Nixon. They have won 18 Acad-
                 emy Awards, 109 Emmy Awards, 19 Writers Guild
                 Awards, and 16 Directors Guild of America Awards.
                 Emmy Award winner Brian Cox portrays McKee in
                 the 2002 ﬁlm Adaptation, which follows the life of
                 a screenwriter trying to adapt the book The Orchid
                 Thief. McKee also serves as a project consultant to
                 ﬁlm and television production companies such as
                 Disney, Pixar, and Paramount as well as major cor-
                 porations (including Microsoft) that regularly send
                 their entire creative staffs to his lectures.
                     McKee believes that executives can engage lis-
                 teners on a whole new level if they toss their Pow-
                 erPoint slides and learn to tell good stories instead.
                 In his best-selling book Story: Substance, Structure,
                 Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting, published
                 in 1997 by HarperCollins, McKee argues that sto-
                 ries “fulﬁll a profound human need to grasp the pat-
                 terns of living—not merely as an intellectual exercise,
                 but within a very personal, emotional experience.”

              What follows is an edited and abridged transcript of
              McKee’s conversation with HBR.
              Why should a CEO or a manager pay attention to a
              screenwriter?
                  A big part of a CEO’s job is to motivate people to
                  reach certain goals. To do that, he or she must en-
                  gage their emotions, and the key to their hearts is
                  story. There are two ways to persuade people. The
                  ﬁrst is by using conventional rhetoric, which is
                  what most executives are trained in. It’s an intel-
                  lectual process, and in the business world it usu-
                  ally consists of a PowerPoint slide presentation
                  in which you say, “Here is our company’s biggest
                  challenge, and here is what we need to do to pros-
                  per.” And you build your case by giving statistics
                  and facts and quotes from authorities. But there
                  are two problems with rhetoric. First, the people
                  you’re talking to have their own set of authorities,
                                          96

H7290-Influence.indd 96 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Storytelling That Moves People

                     statistics, and experiences. While you’re trying to
                     persuade them, they are arguing with you in their
                     heads. Second, if you do succeed in persuading
                     them, you’ve done so only on an intellectual basis.
                     That’s not good enough, because people are not in-
                     spired to act by reason alone.
                          The other way to persuade people—and ulti-
                     mately a much more powerful way—is by unit-
                     ing an idea with an emotion. The best way to do
                     that is by telling a compelling story. In a story, you
                     not only weave a lot of information into the tell-
                     ing but you also arouse your listener’s emotions
                     and energy. Persuading with a story is hard. Any
                     intelligent person can sit down and make lists. It
                     takes rationality but little creativity to design an
                     argument using conventional rhetoric. But it de-
                     mands vivid insight and storytelling skill to pre-
                     sent an idea that packs enough emotional power
                     to be memorable. If you can harness imagination
                     and the principles of a well-told story, then you
                                               97

                  get people rising to their feet amid thunderous ap-
                  plause instead of yawning and ignoring you.
              So, what is a story?
                  Essentially, a story expresses how and why life
                  changes. It begins with a situation in which life is
                  relatively in balance: You come to work day after
                  day, week after week, and everything’s ﬁne. You
                  expect it will go on that way. But then there’s an
                  event—in screenwriting, we call it the “inciting
                  incident”—that throws life out of balance. You get
                  a new job, or the boss dies of a heart attack, or a
                  big customer threatens to leave. The story goes
                  on to describe how, in an effort to restore bal-
                  ance, the protagonist’s subjective expectations
                  crash into an uncooperative objective reality. A
                  good storyteller describes what it’s like to deal with
                  these opposing forces, calling on the protagonist
                                           98

H7290-Influence.indd 98 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Storytelling That Moves People

                     to dig deeper, work with scarce resources, make
                     difﬁcult decisions, take action despite risks, and
                     ultimately discover the truth. All great storytellers
                     since the dawn of time—from the ancient Greeks
                     through Shakespeare and up to the present day—
                     have dealt with this fundamental conﬂict between
                     subjective expectation and cruel reality.
                 How would an executive learn to tell stories?
                     Stories have been implanted in you thousands of
                     times since your mother took you on her knee.
                     You’ve read good books, seen movies, attended
                     plays. What’s more, human beings naturally want
                     to work through stories. Cognitive psychologists
                     describe how the human mind, in its attempt to
                     understand and remember, assembles the bits
                     and pieces of experience into a story, beginning
                     with a personal desire, a life objective, and then
                                              99

H7290-Influence.indd 99 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                  portraying the struggle against the forces that
                  block that desire. Stories are how we remember;
                  we tend to forget lists and bullet points.
                      Businesspeople not only have to understand
                  their companies’ past, but then they must project
                  the future. And how do you imagine the future?
                  As a story. You create scenarios in your head of
                  possible future events to try to anticipate the life
                  of your company or your own personal life. So, if
                  a businessperson understands that his or her own
                  mind naturally wants to frame experience in a
                  story, the key to moving an audience is not to re-
                  sist this impulse but to embrace it by telling a good
                  story.
              What makes a good story?
                  You emphatically do not want to tell a beginning-
                  to-end tale describing how results meet expecta-
                  tions. This is boring and banal. Instead, you want
                                         100

                     to display the struggle between expectation and
                     reality in all its nastiness.
                           For example, let’s imagine the story of a biotech
                     startup we’ll call Chemcorp, whose CEO has to
                     persuade some Wall Street bankers to invest in the
                     company. He could tell them that Chemcorp has
                     discovered a chemical compound that prevents
                     heart attacks and offer up a lot of slides showing
                     them the size of the market, the business plan,
                     the organizational chart, and so on. The bankers
                     would nod politely and stiﬂe yawns while think-
                     ing of all the other companies better positioned in
                     Chemcorp’s market.
                           Alternatively, the CEO could turn his pitch into
                     a story, beginning with someone close to him—
                     say, his father—who died of a heart attack. So
                     nature itself is the ﬁrst antagonist that the CEO-
                     as-protagonist must overcome. The story might
                     unfold like this: In his grief, he realizes that if
                     there had been some chemical indication of heart
                                                101

H7290-Influence.indd 101 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                  disease, his father’s death could have been pre-
                  vented. His company discovers a protein that’s
                  present in the blood just before heart attacks and
                  develops an easy-to-administer, low-cost test.
                      But now it faces a new antagonist: the FDA. The
                  approval process is fraught with risks and dangers.
                  The FDA turns down the ﬁrst application, but new
                  research reveals that the test performs even better
                  than anyone had expected, so the agency approves
                  a second application. Meanwhile, Chemcorp is
                  running out of money, and a key partner drops out
                  and goes off to start his own company. Now Chem-
                  corp is in a ﬁght-to-the-ﬁnish patent race.
                      This accumulation of antagonists creates great
                  suspense. The protagonist has raised the idea in
                  the bankers’ heads that the story might not have
                  a happy ending. By now, he has them on the edge
                  of their seats, and he says, “We won the race, we
                  got the patent, we’re poised to go public and save a
                  quarter-million lives a year.” And the bankers just
                  throw money at him.

                 Aren’t you really talking about exaggeration and
                 manipulation?
                     No. Although businesspeople are often suspicious
                     of stories for the reasons you suggest, the fact is
                     that statistics are used to tell lies and damn lies,
                     while accounting reports are often BS in a ball
                     gown—witness Enron and WorldCom.
                           When people ask me to help them turn their
                     presentations into stories, I begin by asking ques-
                     tions. I kind of psychoanalyze their companies,
                     and amazing dramas pour out. But most compa-
                     nies and executives sweep the dirty laundry, the
                     difﬁculties, the antagonists, and the struggle under
                     the carpet. They prefer to present a rosy—and bor-
                     ing—picture to the world. But as a storyteller, you
                     want to position the problems in the foreground
                     and then show how you’ve overcome them. When
                     you tell the story of your struggles against real an-
                     tagonists, your audience sees you as an exciting,
                     dynamic person. And I know that the storytelling
                                               103

H7290-Influence.indd 103 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                  method works, because after I consulted with a
                  dozen corporations whose principals told exciting
                  stories to Wall Street, they all got their money.
              What’s wrong with painting a positive picture?
                  It doesn’t ring true. You can send out a press re-
                  lease talking about increased sales and a bright
                  future, but your audience knows it’s never that
                  easy. They know you’re not spotless; they know
                  your competitor doesn’t wear a black hat. They
                  know you’ve slanted your statement to make your
                  company look good. Positive, hypothetical pic-
                  tures and boilerplate press releases actually work
                  against you because they foment distrust among
                  the people you’re trying to convince. I suspect that
                  most CEOs do not believe their own spin doctors—
                  and if they don’t believe the hype, why should the
                  public?
                      The great irony of existence is that what makes
                  life worth living does not come from the rosy side.
                                          104

                     We would all rather be lotus-eaters, but life will
                     not allow it. The energy to live comes from the
                     dark side. It comes from everything that makes us
                     suffer. As we struggle against these negative pow-
                     ers, we’re forced to live more deeply, more fully.
                 So acknowledging this dark side makes you more
                 convincing?
                     Of course. Because you’re more truthful. One of
                     the principles of good storytelling is the under-
                     standing that we all live in dread. Fear is when you
                     don’t know what’s going to happen. Dread is when
                     you know what’s going to happen and there’s noth-
                     ing you can do to stop it. Death is the great dread;
                     we all live in an ever-shrinking shadow of time,
                     and between now and then all kinds of bad things
                     could happen.
                           Most of us repress this dread. We get rid of it
                     by inﬂicting it on other people through sarcasm,
                     cheating, abuse, indifference—cruelties great and
                                                105

H7290-Influence.indd 105 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                  small. We all commit those little evils that relieve
                  the pressure and make us feel better. Then we ra-
                  tionalize our bad behavior and convince ourselves
                  we’re good people. Institutions do the same thing:
                  They deny the existence of the negative while in-
                  ﬂicting their dread on other institutions or their
                  employees.
                      If you’re a realist, you know that this is human
                  nature; in fact, you realize that this behavior is
                  the foundation of all nature. The imperative in
                  nature is to follow the golden rule of survival: Do
                  unto others what they do unto you. In nature, if
                  you offer cooperation and get cooperation back,
                  you get along. But if you offer cooperation and get
                  antagonism back, then you give antagonism in re-
                  turn—in spades.
                      Ever since human beings sat around the ﬁre in
                  caves, we’ve told stories to help us deal with the
                  dread of life and the struggle to survive. All great
                  stories illuminate the dark side. I’m not talking
                                          106

H7290-Influence.indd 106 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Storytelling That Moves People

                     about so-called “pure” evil, because there is no
                     such thing. We are all evil and good, and these
                     sides do continual battle. Kenneth Lay says wip-
                     ing out people’s jobs and life savings was uninten-
                     tional. Hannibal Lecter is witty, charming, and
                     brilliant, and he eats people’s livers. Audiences
                     appreciate the truthfulness of a storyteller who
                     acknowledges the dark side of human beings and
                     deals honestly with antagonistic events. The story
                     engenders a positive but realistic energy in the
                     people who hear it.
                 Does this mean you have to be a pessimist?
                     It’s not a question of whether you’re optimistic or
                     pessimistic. It seems to me that the civilized hu-
                     man being is a skeptic—someone who believes
                     nothing at face value. Skepticism is another prin-
                     ciple of the storyteller. The skeptic understands
                     the difference between text and subtext and always
                                             107

H7290-Influence.indd 107 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                  seeks what’s really going on. The skeptic hunts for
                  the truth beneath the surface of life, knowing that
                  the real thoughts and feelings of institutions or in-
                  dividuals are unconscious and unexpressed. The
                  skeptic is always looking behind the mask. Street
                  kids, for example, with their tattoos, piercings,
                  chains, and leather, wear amazing masks, but the
                  skeptic knows the mask is only a persona. Inside
                  anyone working that hard to look ﬁerce is a marsh-
                  mallow. Genuinely hard people make no effort.
              So, a story that embraces darkness produces a posi-
              tive energy in listeners?
                  Absolutely. We follow people in whom we be-
                  lieve. The best leaders I’ve dealt with—producers
                  and directors—have come to terms with dark re-
                  ality. Instead of communicating via spin doctors,
                  they lead their actors and crews through the an-
                  tagonism of a world in which the odds of getting
                                          108

                     the ﬁlm made, distributed, and sold to millions of
                     moviegoers are a thousand to one. They appreciate
                     that the people who work for them love the work
                     and live for the small triumphs that contribute to
                     the ﬁnal triumph.
                           CEOs, likewise, have to sit at the head of the
                     table or in front of the microphone and navigate
                     their companies through the storms of bad econo-
                     mies and tough competition. If you look your audi-
                     ence in the eye, lay out your really scary challenges,
                     and say, “We’ll be lucky as hell if we get through
                     this, but here’s what I think we should do,” they
                     will listen to you.
                           To get people behind you, you can tell a truth-
                     ful story. The story of General Electric is wonder-
                     ful and has nothing to do with Jack Welch’s cult
                     of celebrity. If you have a grand view of life, you
                     can see it on all its complex levels and celebrate it
                     in a story. A great CEO is someone who has come
                     to terms with his or her own mortality and, as a
                                                109

H7290-Influence.indd 109 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                  result, has compassion for others. This compas-
                  sion is expressed in stories.
                      Take the love of work, for example. Years ago,
                  when I was in graduate school, I worked as an in-
                  surance fraud investigator. The claimant in one
                  case was an immigrant who’d suffered a terrible
                  head injury on a carmaker’s assembly line. He’d
                  been the fastest window assembler on the line and
                  took great pride in his work. When I spoke to him,
                  he was waiting to have a titanium plate inserted
                  into his head.
                      The man had been grievously injured, but the
                  company thought he was a fraud. In spite of that,
                  he remained incredibly dedicated. All he wanted
                  was to get back to work. He knew the value of
                  work, no matter how repetitive. He took pride in
                  it and even in the company that had falsely ac-
                  cused him. How wonderful it would have been
                  for the CEO of that car company to tell the tale of
                  how his managers recognized the falseness of their
                                            110

H7290-Influence.indd 110 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Storytelling That Moves People

                     accusation and then rewarded the employee for
                     his dedication. The company, in turn, would have
                     been rewarded with redoubled effort from all the
                     employees who heard that story.
                 How do storytellers discover and unearth the stories
                 that want to be told?
                     The storyteller discovers a story by asking certain
                     key questions. First, what does my protagonist
                     want in order to restore balance in his or her life?
                     Desire is the blood of a story. Desire is not a shop-
                     ping list but a core need that, if satisﬁed, would
                     stop the story in its tracks. Next, what is keeping
                     my protagonist from achieving his or her desire?
                     Forces within? Doubt? Fear? Confusion? Personal
                     conﬂicts with friends, family, lovers? Social con-
                     ﬂicts arising in the various institutions in society?
                     Physical conﬂicts? The forces of Mother Nature?
                     Lethal diseases in the air? Not enough time to get
                                             111

H7290-Influence.indd 111 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                  things done? The damned automobile that won’t
                  start? Antagonists come from people, society,
                  time, space, and every object in it, or any combina-
                  tion of these forces at once. Then, how would my
                  protagonist decide to act in order to achieve his or
                  her desire in the face of these antagonistic forces?
                  It’s in the answer to that question that storytellers
                  discover the truth of their characters, because the
                  heart of a human being is revealed in the choices
                  he or she makes under pressure. Finally, the sto-
                  ryteller leans back from the design of events he or
                  she has created and asks, “Do I believe this? Is it
                  neither an exaggeration nor a soft-soaping of the
                  struggle? Is this an honest telling, though heaven
                  may fall?”
              Does being a good storyteller make you a good leader?
                  Not necessarily, but if you understand the prin-
                  ciples of storytelling, you probably have a good
                                         112

                     understanding of yourself and of human nature,
                     and that tilts the odds in your favor. I can teach
                     the formal principles of stories, but not to a person
                     who hasn’t really lived. The art of storytelling takes
                     intelligence, but it also demands a life experience
                     that I’ve noted in gifted ﬁlm directors: the pain
                     of childhood. Childhood trauma forces you into a
                     kind of mild schizophrenia that makes you see life
                     simultaneously in two ways: First, it’s direct, real-
                     time experience, but at the same moment, your
                     brain records it as material—material out of which
                     you will create business ideas, science, or art. Like
                     a double-edged knife, the creative mind cuts to the
                     truth of self and the humanity of others.
                           Self-knowledge is the root of all great storytell-
                     ing. A storyteller creates all characters from the self
                     by asking the question, “If I were this character in
                     these circumstances, what would I do?” The more
                     you understand your own humanity, the more you
                     can appreciate the humanity of others in all their
                                                 113

                  good-versus-evil struggles. I would argue that the
                  great leaders Jim Collins describes are people with
                  enormous self-knowledge. They have self-insight
                  and self-respect balanced by skepticism. Great
                  storytellers—and, I suspect, great leaders—are
                  skeptics who understand their own masks as well
                  as the masks of life, and this understanding makes
                  them humble. They see the humanity in others
                  and deal with them in a compassionate yet realis-
                  tic way. That duality makes for a wonderful leader.

                       The Surprising
                      Persuasiveness of
                        a Sticky Note

                           By Kevin Hogan

H7290-Influence.indd 115 9/11/17 7:39 AM H7290-Influence.indd 116 9/11/17 7:39 AM  I magine that you really need to convince someone to do something, such as follow through on a task. You might be surprised to learn that one of the best ways to get someone to comply with your request is through a tiny nuance that adds a personal touch: at- taching a sticky note. A brilliant set of experiments by Randy Garner at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas, found that a) adding a personal touch, and b) making someone feel like you're asking a favor of them (and not just anyone) can bring about impressive results when done in tandem.1

                                           117

H7290-Influence.indd 117 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                  The goal of Garner’s experiments was to see what
              was necessary to generate compliance in completing
              surveys—which are often quite lengthy and tedious—
              by fellow professors at the university, using only in-
              terofﬁce mail as the conduit of communication. The
              wild card factor in these experiments was the use of
              sticky notes. In one experiment, he sent surveys to
              three separate groups of 50 professors (150 profes-
              sors total). Three groups received three different re-
              quests, as follows:

                           Group 1 received a survey with a sticky note
                           attached asking for the return of the com-
                           pleted survey.

                           Group 2 received a survey with the same
                           handwritten message on the cover letter
                           instead of an attached sticky note.

                           Group 3 received a survey with a cover letter
                           but no handwritten message.

H7290-Influence.indd 118 9/11/17 7:39 AM  The Surprising Persuasiveness of a Sticky Note

                     What happened?

                           Group 3: 36% of the professors returned the
                           survey.

                           Group 2: 48% of the professors returned the
                           survey.

                           Group 1: 76% of the professors returned the
                           survey.

                     Generalizing this experiment in other contexts
                 simply requires understanding why the sticky note
                 worked so well. It represents many powerful behav-
                 ioral triggers all in one little object:

                       1. It doesn’t match the environment: The sticky
                           note takes up space and looks a bit cluttered.
                           The brain, therefore, wants it gone.

                      2. It gets attention ﬁrst because of #1. It’s difﬁ-
                           cult to ignore.
                                                 119

H7290-Influence.indd 119 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

                   3. It’s personalized. (That’s the difference
                           between Group 2 and Group 3 in the
                           experiment.)

                   4. Ultimately, the sticky note represents one per-
                           son communicating with another important
                           person—almost as if it is a favor or special
                           request, which makes the recipient feel
                           important.

                  Garner couldn’t help but explore the sticky note
              factor further. He decided to do a second experiment
              where he sent a group of professors a blank sticky
              note attached to one of the surveys. Here’s what
              happened:

                           Group 1 received a survey with a personalized
                           sticky note message.

                           Group 2 received a survey with a blank sticky
                           note attached.

H7290-Influence.indd 120 9/11/17 7:39 AM  The Surprising Persuasiveness of a Sticky Note

                           Group 3 received a survey with no sticky note.

                     What happened in the second study?

                           Group 3: 34% returned the survey with no
                           sticky note (similar to the ﬁrst experiment).

                           Group 2: 43% returned the survey with the
                           blank sticky note

                           Group 1: 69% returned the survey with the
                           personalized sticky note (similar to the ﬁrst
                           experiment).

                     The real magic, it seems, is not the sticky note
                 itself but the sense of connection, meaning, and iden-
                 tity that the sticky note represents. The person send-
                 ing the survey is personally asking me in a special
                 way (not just writing it on the survey) to help him or
                 her out.
                     But there’s more to compliance than just the result.
                 There’s also the speed of compliance and the quality
                                                 121

H7290-Influence.indd 121 9/11/17 7:39 AM  Inﬂuence and Persuasion

              of the effort. Garner experimented to see how quickly
              people would return a follow-up survey if there was
              a sticky note attached and also measured how much
              information the person being surveyed returned if
              there was a sticky note attached versus the group that
              received no sticky note. Here’s what he found:

                           Group 1 (with sticky note) returned their self-
                           addressed stamped envelopes (SASEs) and
                           surveys within an average of about 4 days.

                           Group 2 (no sticky note) returned their SASEs
                           and surveys in an average of about 5 1/2 days.

                  But the most notable difference is that Group 1
              also sent signiﬁcantly more comments and answered
              other open-ended questions with more words than
              Group 2 did.
                  Further experiments revealed that if a task is easy
              to perform or comply with, a simple sticky note re-
              quest needs no further personalization. But when
                                              122

H7290-Influence.indd 122 9/11/17 7:39 AM  The Surprising Persuasiveness of a Sticky Note

                 the task is more involved, a more highly personal-
                 ized sticky note was signiﬁcantly more effective than
                 a simple standard sticky note request. What makes
                 it truly personal? Writing a brief message is effec-
                 tive, but adding the person’s ﬁrst name at the top and
                 your initials at the bottom causes signiﬁcantly greater
                 compliance.
                     I’ve used this personalization theory with busi-
                 nesspeople around the world to great success. For ex-
                 ample, a mortgage broker I worked with tested this
                 approach in mailings, effectively doubling the num-
                 ber of phone calls from people pursuing a loan with
                 the broker. And it’s not just effective at the ofﬁce or
                 with clients. The people you live with are going to re-
                 spond to the sticky note model as well. (Try sticking
                 one on the bathroom mirror and see what happens.)
                     Recently, the personalized sticky note has been put
                 into digital form for use in email, with mixed results.
                 It’s most effective in email when the two people have
                 met or know each other. It had only a modest effect
                                               123

              in sales letters designed to make an immediate sale,
              when the reader didn’t know the author of the sales
              letter. Using the notes in sales letters designed for
              current clients and customers needs further testing.
                  The next time you need colleagues to comply with
              a request, or the next time you’re giving a potential
              client a portfolio to review, try leaving a sticky note.
              A small personal touch will go a long way toward get-
              ting the results you want.

When do you talk to Mr. Intuitive and when to Mr. Rational? I'd argue that too often, selling to Mr. Rational leads to analysis paralysis, especially for complex products or services. And yet many of us continue to market almost exclusively to Mr. Rational. The result is that we spend too much time chasing sales oppor- tunities that eventually stall out. We need to improve our ability to sell to Mr. Intuitive. We default to selling to Mr. Rational because when we think of ourselves, we identify with our conscious

              rational mind. We can’t imagine that serious execu-
              tives would make decisions based on emotion, be-
              cause we view our emotional decisions as irrational
              and irresponsible.
                  But what if Mr. Intuitive has a logic of his own?
              In recent years, psychologists and behavioral econo-
              mists have shown that our emotional decisions are
              neither irrational nor irresponsible. In fact, we now
              understand that our unconscious decisions do in fact
              follow a clear logic. They are based on a deeply em-
              pirical mental-processing system that is capable of
              effortlessly cycling through millions of bits of data
              without getting overwhelmed. Our conscious mind,
              on the other hand, has a strict bottleneck, because it
              can only process three or four new pieces of informa-
              tion at a time due to the limitations of our working
              memory.1
                  The Iowa Gambling Task study, for example,
              highlights how effective the emotional brain is at ef-
              fortlessly ﬁguring out the probability of success for
              maximum gain.2 Subjects were given an imaginary

                 budget and four stacks of cards. The objective of the
                 game was to win as much money as possible, and to
                 do so, subjects were instructed to draw cards from
                 any of the four decks.
                     The subjects were not aware that the decks were
                 carefully prepared. Drawing from two of the decks
                 led to consistent wins, while the other two had high
                 payouts but carried oversized punishments. The logi-
                 cal choice was to avoid the dangerous decks, and af-
                 ter about 50 cards, people did stop drawing from the
                 risky decks. It wasn’t until the 80th card, however,
                 that people could explain why. Logic is slow.
                     But the researchers tracked the subjects’ anxiety
                 and found that people started to become nervous
                 when reaching for the risky deck after drawing only
                 10 cards. Intuition is fast.
                     Harvard Business School professor Gerald Zalt-
                 man says that 95% of our purchase decisions take
                 place unconsciously. But why, then, are we not able
                 to look back through our decision history and ﬁnd
                 countless examples of emotional decisions? Because
                                                129

              our conscious mind will always make up reasons to
              justify our unconscious decisions.
                  In a study of people who’d had the left and right
              hemisphere of their brains severed in order to pre-
              vent future epileptic seizures, scientists were able to
              deliver a message to the right side of the brain to “Go
              to the water fountain down the hall and get a drink.”3
              After seeing the message, the subject would get up
              and start to leave the room, and that’s when the scien-
              tist would deliver a message to the opposite, left side
              of the brain, asking, “Where are you going?” Now re-
              member, the left side of the brain never saw the mes-
              sage about the fountain. But did the left brain admit
              it didn’t know the answer? No. Instead it shamelessly
              fabricated a rational reason, something like, “It’s cold
              in here. I’m going to get my jacket.”
                  So if you can’t reliably use your own decision-
              making history as a guide, when do you know you
              should be selling based on logic and when on
              emotion?

                     Here’s the short rule of thumb: Sell to Mr. Ratio-
                 nal for simple sales and to Mr. Intuitive for complex
                 sales.
                     This conclusion is backed by a 2011 study based on
                 subjects selecting the best used car from a selection
                 of four cars. Each car was rated in four different cat-
                 egories (such as gas mileage). But one car clearly had
                 the best attributes. In this “easy” situation with only
                 four variables, the conscious deciders were 15% bet-
                 ter at choosing the best car than the unconscious de-
                 ciders. When the researchers made the decision more
                 complex—ratcheting the number of variables up to
                 12—unconscious deciders were 42% better than con-
                 scious deciders at selecting the best car. Many other
                 studies have shown how our conscious minds become
                 overloaded by too much information.
                     If you want to inﬂuence how a customer feels
                 about your product, provide an experience that cre-
                 ates the desired emotion. One of the best ways for a
                 customer to experience your complex product is by
                                                131

              sharing a vivid customer story. Research has shown
              that stories can activate the region of the brain that
              processes sights, sounds, tastes, and movement.4 Con-
              trast this approach with that of a salesperson deliver-
              ing a data dump in the form of an 85-slide PowerPoint
              presentation.
                  Rather than thinking of the emotional mind as ir-
              rational, think of it this way: An emotion is simply
              the way the unconscious communicates its decision
              to the conscious mind.

Happiness Isn't the Absence of Negative Feelings

     By Jennifer Moss
            1

H appiness feels intolerably elusive for many of us. Like fog, you can see it from afar, dense and full of shape. But upon approach, its par- ticles loosen, and suddenly it becomes out of reach, even though it's all around you. We put so much emphasis on the pursuit of hap- piness, but if you stop and think about it, to pursue is to chase something without a guarantee of ever catching it. Up until about six years ago, I was fervently and ineffectively chasing happiness. My husband, Jim, and I were living in San Jose, California, with our two-year-old son and a second baby on the way. On

paper, our life appeared rosy. Still, I couldn't seem to ﬁnd the joy. I always felt so guilty about my sadness. My problems were embarrassingly "ﬁrst world." Then in September 2009, my world tilted. Jim fell severely ill. He was diagnosed with Swine Flu (H1N1) and West Nile virus, then Guillain-Barré Syndrome, due to his compromised immune system. Jim never worried about death. I did. When we were told Jim's illness was letting up, that he'd won this round, we were relieved. When we were told Jim might not walk for some time---likely a year, maybe longer---we were alarmed. We knew this prognosis meant the end of Jim's career as a pro lacrosse player. What we didn't know was how we'd pay the medical bills or how much energy Jim would have for parenting. With 10 weeks to go until the baby arrived, I had very little time to think and reﬂect. Jim, on the other hand, only had time. He was used to moving at high speeds, both in life and on the ﬁeld, so minutes

Happiness Isn't the Absence of Negative Feelings

passed like hours in the hospital. He was kept busy with physical and occupational therapy, but he was also in need of psychological support. He put out a note to people in his social networks, asking them for reading suggestions that would help him to mentally heal. Suggestions ﬂowed in. Books and audio tapes were delivered bedside with notes about how they'd "helped so much" after whatever dif- ﬁculty this person had also experienced but overcame. Jim would spend his days reading motivational books from Tony Robbins and Oprah or watching TED talks, like Jill Bolte Taylor's "My Stroke of In- sight," about the impacts of brain trauma. He would analyze spiritual books by Deepak Chopra and the Dalai Lama. Or review scientiﬁc research papers about happiness and gratitude written by researchers Martin Seligman, Shawn Achor, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and many others. There was a repeated theme throughout all the lit- erature---gratitude. It would weave in and out of the

                               5

Happiness

science, the true stories, and the drivers for success. Jim responded by starting a gratitude journal of his own. He got very thankful---thankful for the people who changed his sheets, thankful for the family that would bring him hot meals at dinner. Thankful for the nurse who would encourage him and thankful for the extra attention his rehab team would give him on their own time. (The team once told Jim that they were only putting in extra time because they knew how grateful he was for their efforts.) He asked that I participate in his approach, and because I wanted to help him to heal so badly and I was seeing how hard it was for him, I tried hard to be in a positive place when I came into his world in- side that hospital room. I wasn't always at my best. I sometimes resented that I couldn't break down---but after a while I started to see how rapidly he was get- ting better. And although our paths weren't congru- ent, we were making it work. I was "coming around."

                           6

Happiness Isn't the Absence of Negative Feelings

It was shaky and scary, but when Jim walked out of the hospital on crutches (he stubbornly refused the wheelchair) only six weeks after he was rushed by ambulance to the ER, we decided there was some- thing more to his healing than just dumb luck. One of those early books that inﬂuenced Jim was Seligman's Flourish. A psychologist and former presi- dent of the American Psychology Association, Selig- man was responsible for deﬁning the term "PERMA," the root of many positive psychology research proj- ects around the world. The acronym stands for the ﬁve elements essential to lasting contentment:

• Positive emotion: Peace, gratitude, satisfaction, pleasure, inspiration, hope, curiosity, and love fall into this category.

• Engagement: Losing ourselves in a task or project provides us with a sense of "disappeared time" because we are so highly engaged.

                              7

Happiness

• Relationships: People who have meaningful, positive relationships with others are happier than those who do not.

• Meaning: Meaning comes from serving a cause bigger than ourselves. Whether it's a religion or a cause that helps humanity in some way, we all need meaning in our lives.

• Accomplishment/achievement: To feel signiﬁ- cant life satisfaction, we must strive to better ourselves.

We slowly brought these ﬁve tenets back into our lives. Jim returned to Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario to research neuroscience, and we promptly started up Plasticity Labs to help teach others what we'd learned about the pursuit of happiness. As our lives came to include more empathy, gratitude, and meaning, I stopped feeling sad.

                           8

Happiness Isn't the Absence of Negative Feelings

So when I see skepticism directed at the positive psychology movement, I take it personally. Do these critics have a problem with gratitude? Relationships? Meaning? Hope? Perhaps part of the problem is that we oversim- plify happiness in our pop culture and media, which makes it easy to discard as unproven. As Vanessa Buote, a postdoctoral fellow in social psychology, put it to me in an email:

One of the misconceptions about happiness is that happiness is being cheerful, joyous, and content all the time; always having a smile on your face. It's not---being happy and leading rich lives is about taking the good with the bad, and learning how to reframe the bad. In fact, in the recent \[article in the Journal of Experimental Psychology\], "Emodiversity and the Emotional Ecosystem," by Harvard \[researcher Jordi\] Quoid- bach, f ound that experiencing a wide range of

                               9

Happiness

emotions---both positive and negative---was linked to positive mental and physical well-being.

Not only do we tend to misunderstand what hap- piness is, we also tend to chase it the wrong way. Shawn Achor, the researcher and corporate trainer who wrote the HBR article "Positive Intelligence," told me that most people think about happiness the wrong way: "The biggest misconception of the hap- piness industry is that happiness is an end, not a means. We think that if we get what we want, then we'll be happy. But it turns out that our brains actu- ally work in the opposite direction." Buote agrees: "We sometimes tend to see 'being happy' as the end goal, but we forget that what's really important is the journey; ﬁnding out what makes us the happiest and regularly engaging in those activi- ties to help us lead a more fulﬁlling life." In other words, we're not happy when we're chasing happiness. We're happiest when we're not thinking

                           10

Happiness Isn't the Absence of Negative Feelings

about it, when we're enjoying the present moment be- cause we're lost in a meaningful project, working to- ward a higher goal, or helping someone who needs us. Healthy positivity doesn't mean cloaking your au- thentic feelings. Happiness is not the absence of suf- fering; it's the ability to rebound from it. And hap- piness is not the same as joy or ecstasy; happiness includes contentment, well-being, and the emotional ﬂexibility to experience a full range of emotions. At our company, some of us have dealt with anxiety and depression. Some have experienced PTSD. Some of us have witnessed severe mental illness in our fami- lies, and some of us have not. We openly share. Or we don't---either way is ﬁne. We support tears in the ofﬁce, if the situation calls for it (in both sorrow and in laughter). Some people---perhaps looking for a fresh angle--- have even argued that happiness is harmful (see, for example, the last two articles in this book). But the point of practicing exercises that help increase

                              11

Happiness

mental and emotional ﬁtness is not to learn to paste a smile on your face or wish away your problems. It's to learn how to handle stressors with more resilience through training, just as you would train to run a marathon. During my time with Jim in the hospital, I watched him change. It happened in subtle ways at ﬁrst, but then all at once I realized that practicing gratitude and the happiness that comes with it had given me a gift: It gave me back Jim. If happiness is harmful--- then I say, bring it on.

Being Happy at Work Matters

    By Annie McKee
          13

P eople used to believe that you didn't have to be happy at work to succeed. And you didn't need to like the people you worked with, or even share their values. "Work is not personal," the think- ing went. This is bunk. My research with dozens of companies and hun- dreds of people---along with the research conducted by neuroscientists like Richard Davidson and V.S. Ramachandran and scholars such as Shawn Achor--- increasingly points to a simple fact: Happy people are better workers. Those who are engaged with their jobs and colleagues work harder---and smarter.

                          15

Happiness

And yet, an alarmingly high number of people aren't engaged. According to a sobering 2013 Gallup report, only 30% of the U.S. workforce is engaged. This echoes what I've seen in my work. Not very many people are truly "emotionally and intellectu- ally committed" to their organizations.1 Far too many couldn't care less about what's happening around them. For them, Wednesday is "hump day" and they're just working to get to Friday. And then there's the other end of the bell curve---the nearly one out of ﬁve employees who is actively disengaged, according to the same Gallup report. These people are sabotag- ing projects, backstabbing colleagues, and generally wreaking havoc in their workplaces. The Gallup report also notes that employee engage- ment has remained largely constant over the years de- spite economic ups and downs. Scary: We're not en- gaged with work, and we haven't been for a long time. Disengaged, unhappy people aren't any fun to work with and don't add much value; they impact our or-

                          16

Being Happy at Work Matters

ganizations (and our economy) in profoundly nega- tive ways. It's even worse when leaders are disen- gaged because they infect others with their attitude. Their emotions and mindsets impact others' moods and performance tremendously. After all, how we feel is linked to what and how we think. In other words, thought inﬂuences emotion, and emotion inﬂuences thinking.2 It's time to ﬁnally blow up the myth that feel- ings don't matter at work. Science is on our side: There are clear neurological links between feelings, thoughts, and actions.3 When we are in the grip of strong negative emotions, it's like having blinders on. We focus mostly---sometimes only---on the source of the pain. We don't process information as well, think creatively, or make good decisions. Frustration, an- ger, and stress cause an important part of us to shut down---the part that's thinking and engaged.4 Disen- gagement is a natural neurological and psychological response to pervasive negative emotions.

                           17

Happiness

But it's not just negative emotions we need to watch out for. Extremely strong positive emotions can have the same effect.5 Some studies show that too much happiness can make you less creative and prone to engaging in riskier behaviors (think about how we act like fools when we fall in love). On the work front: I've seen groups of people worked up into a frenzy at sales conferences and corporate pep ral- lies. Little learning or innovation comes out of these meetings. Throw in a lot of alcohol, and you've got a whole host of problems. If we can agree that our emotional states at work matter, what can we do to increase engagement and improve performance? Over the past few years, my team at the Teleos Leadership Institute and I have studied dozens of organizations and interviewed thousands of people. The early ﬁndings about the links between people's feelings and engagement are fascinating. There are clear similarities in what people say they want and

                          18

Being Happy at Work Matters

need, no matter where they are from, whom they work for, or what ﬁeld they're in. We often assume that there are huge differences across industries and around the world, but the research challenges that assumption. To be fully engaged and happy, virtually everyone tells, we need three things:

1.  A meaningful vision of the future. When peo- ple talked with our research team about what was working and what wasn't in their organi- zations and what helped or hindered them the most, they talked about vision. People want to be able to see the future and know how they ﬁt in. And, as we know from our work with organizational behavior expert Richard Boy- atzis on intentional change, people learn and change when they have a personal vision that is linked to an organizational vision.6 Sadly, far too many leaders don't paint a very compelling

                          19

     Happiness

vision of the future, they don't try to link it to people's personal visions, and they don't com- municate well. And they lose people as a result.

2.  A sense of purpose. People want to feel as if their work matters, that their contributions help achieve something really important. And except for those at the tippy top, shareholder value isn't a meaningful goal that excites and engages them. They want to know that they--- and their organizations---are doing something big that matters to other people.

3.  Great relationships. We know that people join an organization and leave a boss.7 A disso- nant relationship with one's boss is downright painful. So too are bad relationships with colleagues. Leaders, managers, and employ- ees have all told us that close, trusting, and supportive relationships are hugely important to their state of mind---and their willingness contribute to a team.

                         20

     Being Happy at Work Matters

    Added up, brain science and organizational re- search are in fact debunking the old myths: Emotions matter a lot at work. Happiness is important. To be fully engaged, people need vision, meaning, purpose, and resonant relationships. It's on us as individuals to ﬁnd ways to live our val- ues at work and build great relationships. And it's on leaders to create an environment where people can thrive. It's simple and it's practical: If you want an engaged workforce, pay attention to how you create a vision, link people's work to your company's larger purpose, and reward individuals who resonate with others.

    The Science Behind the Smile

An interview with Daniel Gilbert by Gardiner Morse

                       25

H arvard psychology professor Daniel Gilbert is widely known for his 2006 best seller, Stum- bling on Happiness. His work reveals, among other things, the systematic mistakes we all make in imagining how happy (or miserable) we'll be. In this edited interview with HBR's Gardiner Morse, Gilbert surveys the ﬁeld of happiness research and explores its frontiers.

HBR: Happiness research has become a hot topic in the past 20 years. Why?

Gilbert: It's only recently that we realized we could marry one of our oldest questions---"What

                          27

Happiness

is the nature of human happiness?"---to our new- est way of getting answers: science. Until just a few decades ago, the problem of happiness was mainly in the hands of philosophers and poets. Psychologists have always been interested in emotion, but in the past two decades the study of emotion has exploded, and one of the emotions that psychologists have studied most intensively is happiness. Recently economists and neurosci- entists joined the party. All these disciplines have distinct but intersecting interests: Psychologists want to understand what people feel, economists want to know what people value, and neuroscien- tists want to know how people's brains respond to rewards. Having three separate disciplines all in- terested in a single topic has put that topic on the scientiﬁc map. Papers on happiness are published in Science, people who study happiness win No- bel prizes, and governments all over the world are rushing to ﬁgure out how to measure and increase the happiness of their citizens.

                        28

The Science Behind the Smile

How is it possible to measure something as subjective as happiness?

Measuring subjective experiences is a lot easier than you think. It's what your eye doctor does when she ﬁts you for glasses. She puts a lens in front of your eye and asks you to report your ex- perience, and then she puts another lens up, and then another. She uses your reports as data, sub- mits the data to scientiﬁc analysis, and designs a lens that will give you perfect vision---all on the basis of your reports of your subjective experience. People's real-time reports are very good approxi- mations of their experiences, and they make it possible for us to see the world through their eyes. People may not be able to tell us how happy they were yesterday or how happy they will be tomor- row, but they can tell us how they're feeling at the moment we ask them. "How are you?" may be the world's most frequently asked question, and no- body's stumped by it.

                            29

Happiness

     There are many ways to measure happiness. We

can ask people "How happy are you right now?" and have them rate it on a scale. We can use mag- netic resonance imaging to measure cerebral blood ﬂow, or electromyography to measure the activity of the "smile muscles" in the face. But in most cir- cumstances those measures are highly correlated, and you'd have to be the federal government to prefer the complicated, expensive measures over the simple, inexpensive one.

But isn't the scale itself subjective? Your ﬁve might be my six.

Imagine that a drugstore sold a bunch of cheap thermometers that weren't very well calibrated. People with normal temperatures might get read- ings other than 98.6, and two people with the same temperature might get different readings. These inaccuracies could cause people to seek medical

                          30

The Science Behind the Smile

treatment they didn't need or to miss getting treat- ment they did need. So buggy thermometers are sometimes a problem---but not always. For ex- ample, if I brought 100 people to my lab, exposed half of them to a ﬂu virus, and then used those buggy thermometers to take their temperatures a week later, the average temperature of the people who'd been exposed would almost surely be higher than the average temperature of the others. Some thermometers would underestimate, some would overestimate, but as long as I measured enough people, the inaccuracies would cancel themselves out. Even with poorly calibrated instruments, we can compare large groups of people. A rating scale is like a buggy thermometer. Its inaccuracies make it inappropriate for some kinds of measurement (for example, saying exactly how happy John was at 10:42 am on July 3, 2010), but it's perfectly appropriate for the kinds of measure- ments most psychological scientists make.

                         31

Happiness

What did all these happiness researchers discover?

Much of the research conﬁrms things we've always suspected. For example, in general people who are in good romantic relationships are happier than those who aren't. Healthy people are happier than sick people. People who participate in their churches are happier than those who don't. Rich people are happier than poor people. And so on. That said, there have been some surprises. For example, while all these things do make people happier, it's astonishing how little any one of them matters. Yes, a new house or a new spouse will make you happier, but not much and not for long. As it turns out, people are not very good at predict- ing what will make them happy or how long that happiness will last. They expect positive events to make them much happier than those events actu- ally do, and they expect negative events to make them unhappier than they actually do. In both ﬁeld

                         32

The Science Behind the Smile

and lab studies, we've found that winning or losing an election, gaining or losing a romantic partner, getting or not getting a promotion, passing or fail- ing an exam all have less impact on happiness than people think they will. A recent study showed that very few experiences affect us for more than three months. When good things happen, we celebrate for a while and then sober up. When bad things happen, we weep and whine for a while and then pick ourselves up and get on with it.

Why do events have such a ﬂeeting effect on hap- piness?

One reason is that people are good at synthesizing happiness---at ﬁnding silver linings. As a result, they usually end up happier than they expect after almost any kind of trauma or tragedy. Pick up any newspaper, and you'll ﬁnd plenty of examples. Re- member Jim Wright, who resigned in disgrace as

                           33

Speaker of the House of Representatives because of a shady book deal? A few years later he told the New York Times that he was "so much better off, physically, ﬁnancially, emotionally, mentally and in almost every other way." Then there's Moreese Bickham, who spent 37 years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary; after his release he said, "I don't have one minute's regret. It was a glorious experi- ence." These guys appear to be living in the best of all possible worlds. Speaking of which, Pete Best, the original drummer for the Beatles, was replaced by Ringo Starr in 1962, just before the Beatles got big. Now he's a session drummer. What did he have to say about missing out on the chance to belong to the most famous band of the 20th century? "I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles." One of the most reliable ﬁndings of the happi- ness studies is that we do not have to go running to a therapist every time our shoelaces break. We have a remarkable ability to make the best of

                        34

The Science Behind the Smile

things. Most people are more resilient than they realize.

Aren't they deluding themselves? Isn't real happiness better than synthetic happiness?

Let's be careful with terms. Nylon is real; it's just not natural. Synthetic happiness is perfectly real; it's just man-made. Synthetic happiness is what we produce when we don't get what we want, and natural happiness is what we experience when we do. They have different origins, but they are not necessarily different in terms of how they feel. One is not obviously better than the other. Of course, most folks don't see it that way. Most folks think that synthetic happiness isn't as "good" as the other kind---that people who produce it are just fooling themselves and aren't really happy. I know of no evidence demonstrating that that's the case. If you go blind or lose a fortune, you'll ﬁnd

                           35

Happiness

that there's a whole new life on the other side of those events. And you'll ﬁnd many things about that new life that are quite good. In fact, you'll undoubtedly ﬁnd a few things that are even bet- ter than what you had before. You're not lying to yourself; you're not delusional. You're discover- ing things you didn't know---couldn't know---un- til you were in that new life. You are looking for things that make your new life better, you are ﬁnd- ing them, and they are making you happy. What is most striking to me as a scientist is that most of us don't realize how good we're going to be at ﬁnd- ing these things. We'd never say, "Oh, of course, if I lost my money or my wife left me, I'd ﬁnd a way to be just as happy as I am now." We'd never say it---but it's true.

Is being happy always desirable? Look at all the un- happy creative geniuses---Beethoven, van Gogh, Hem- ingway. Doesn't a certain amount of unhappiness spur good performance?

                         36

The Science Behind the Smile

Nonsense! Everyone can think of a historical example of someone who was both miserable and creative, but that doesn't mean misery generally promotes creativity. There's certainly someone out there who smoked two packs of cigarettes a day and lived to be 90, but that doesn't mean cigarettes are good for you. The difference between using an- ecdotes to prove a point and using science to prove a point is that in science you can't just cherry-pick the story that suits you best. You have to exam- ine all the stories, or at least take a fair sample of them, and see if there are more miserable creatives or happy creatives, more miserable noncreatives or happy noncreatives. If misery promoted creativity, you'd see a higher percentage of creatives among the miserable than among the delighted. And you don't. By and large, happy people are more cre- ative and more productive. Has there ever been a human being whose misery was the source of his creativity? Of course. But that person is the excep- tion, not the rule.

                          37

Happiness

Many managers would say that contented people aren't the most productive employees, so you want to keep people a little uncomfortable, maybe a little anx- ious, about their jobs.

Managers who collect data instead of relying on intuition don't say that. I know of no data showing that anxious, fearful employees are more creative or productive. Remember, contentment doesn't mean sitting and staring at the wall. That's what people do when they're bored, and people hate being bored. We know that people are happi- est when they're appropriately challenged---when they're trying to achieve goals that are difﬁcult but not out of reach. Challenge and threat are not the same thing. People blossom when challenged and wither when threatened. Sure, you can get results from threats: Tell someone, "If you don't get this to me by Friday, you're ﬁred," and you'll probably have it by Friday. But you'll also have an

                             38

The Science Behind the Smile

employee who will thereafter do his best to under- mine you, who will feel no loyalty to the organiza- tion, and who will never do more than he must. It would be much more effective to tell your em- ployee, "I don't think most people could get this done by Friday. But I have full faith and conﬁdence that you can. And it's hugely important to the en- tire team." Psychologists have studied reward and punishment for a century, and the bottom line is perfectly clear: Reward works better.

So challenge makes people happy. What else do we know now about the sources of happiness?

If I had to summarize all the scientiﬁc literature on the causes of human happiness in one word, that word would be "social." We are by far the most so- cial species on Earth. Even ants have nothing on us. If I wanted to predict your happiness, and I could know only one thing about you, I wouldn't want to

                           39

Happiness

know your gender, religion, health, or income. I'd want to know about your social network---about your friends and family and the strength of your bonds with them.

Beyond having rich networks, what makes us happy day to day?

The psychologist Ed Diener has a ﬁnding I really like. He essentially shows that the frequency of your positive experiences is a much better predic- tor of your happiness than is the intensity of your positive experiences. When we think about what would make us happy, we tend to think of intense events---going on a date with a movie star, win- ning a Pulitzer, buying a yacht. But Diener and his colleagues have shown that how good your expe- riences are doesn't matter nearly as much as how many good experiences you have. Somebody who has a dozen mildly nice things happen each day

                         40

The Science Behind the Smile

is likely to be happier than somebody who has a single truly amazing thing happen. So wear com- fortable shoes, give your wife a big kiss, sneak a french fry. It sounds like small stuff, and it is. But the small stuff matters. I think this helps explain why it's so hard for us to forecast our affective states. We imagine that one or two big things will have a profound effect. But it looks like happiness is the sum of hundreds of small things. Achieving happiness requires the same ap- proach as losing weight. People trying to lose weight want a magic pill that will give them instant results. Ain't no such thing. We know exactly how people lose weight: They eat less and exercise more. They don't have to eat much less or exercise much more--- they just have to do those things consistently. Over time it adds up. Happiness is like that. The things you can do to increase your happiness are obvious and small and take just a little time. But you have to do them every day and wait for the results.

                         41

Happiness

What are those little things we can do to increase our happiness?

They won't surprise you any more than "eat less and exercise more" does. The main things are to commit to some simple behaviors---meditating, exercising, getting enough sleep---and to practice altruism. One of the most selﬁsh things you can do is help others. Volunteer at a homeless shelter. You may or may not help the homeless, but you will almost surely help yourself. And nurture your social connections. Twice a week, write down three things you're grate- ful for, and tell someone why. I know these sound like homilies from your grandmother. Well, your grandmother was smart. The secret of happiness is like the secret of weight loss: It's not a secret!

If there's no secret, what's left to study?

There's no shortage of questions. For decades psychologists and economists have been asking,

                            42

The Science Behind the Smile

"Who's happy? The rich? The poor? The young? The old?" The best we could do was divide people into groups, survey them once or maybe twice, and try to determine if the people in one group were, on average, happier than those in the others. The tools we used were pretty blunt instruments. But now millions of people are carrying little com- puters in their pockets---smartphones---and this allows us to collect data in real time from huge numbers of people about what they are doing and feeling from moment to moment. That's never been possible before. One of my collaborators, Matt Killingsworth, has built an experience-sampling application called Track Your Happiness. He follows more than 15,000 people by iPhone, querying them several times a day about their activities and emo- tional states. Are they at home? On a bus? Watch- ing television? Praying? How are they feeling? What are they thinking about? With this tech- nology, Matt's beginning to answer a much better

                        43

Happiness

question than the one we've been asking for de- cades. Instead of asking who is happy, he can ask when they are happy. He doesn't get the answer by asking, "When are you happy?"---because frankly, people don't know. He gets it by tracking people over days, months, and years and measuring what they are doing and how happy they are while they are doing it. I think this kind of technology is about to revolutionize our understanding of daily emotions and human well-being. (See the sidebar "The Future of Happiness Research.")

What are the new frontiers of happiness research?

We need to get more speciﬁc about what we are measuring. Many scientists say they are studying happiness, but when you look at what they're mea- suring, you ﬁnd they are actually studying depres- sion or life satisfaction. These things are related to happiness, of course, but they are not the same as happiness. Research shows that people with

                         44

The Science Behind the Smile

children are typically less happy on a moment-to- moment basis than people without children. But people who have kids may feel fulﬁlled in a way that people without kids do not. It doesn't make sense to say that people with kids are happier, or that people without kids are happier; each group is happier in some ways and less happy in others. We need to stop painting our portrait of happiness with such a fat brush.

Will all this research ultimately make us happier?

We are learning and will continue to learn how to maximize our happiness. So yes, there is no doubt that the research has helped and will continue to help us increase our happiness. But that still leaves the big question: What kind of happiness should we want? For example, do we want the average hap- piness of our moments to be as large as possible, or do we want the sum of our happy moments to be as large as possible? Those are different things.

                           45

Happiness

Do we want lives free of pain and heartache, or is there value in those experiences? Science will soon be able to tell us how to live the lives we want, but it will never tell us what kinds of lives we should want to live. That will be for us to decide.

     THE FUTURE OF HAPPINESS RESEARCH

              by Matthew Killingsworth

You'd think it would be easy to ﬁgure out what makes us happy. Until recently, though, researchers have had to rely mainly on people's reports about their average emotional states over long periods of time and on eas- ily surveyed predictors of happiness, such as demo- graphic variables. As a result, we know that married or wealthy people are, on average, happier than unmar- ried or less-well-oﬀ people. But what is it about being married or having money that makes people happy?

                          46

The Science Behind the Smile

Focusing on average emotional states also smoothes out short-term ﬂuctuations in happiness and con- sequently diminishes our ability to understand the causes of those ﬂuctuations. For example, how do the moment-by-moment details of a person's day aﬀect that person's happiness? We can now begin to answer questions like these, thanks to the smartphone. For an ongoing research project called Track Your Happiness, I have recruited more than 15,000 people in 83 countries to report their emotional states in real time, using devices they carry with them every day. I created an iPhone web app that queries users at random intervals, asking them about their mood (respondents slide a button along a scale that ranges from "very bad" to "very good"), what they are doing (they can select from 22 options, including commuting, working, exercising, (Continued)

Happiness

and eating), and factors such as their level of produc- tivity, the nature of their environment, the amount and quality of their sleep, and their social interactions. Since 2009 we have collected more than half a mil- lion data points---making this, to my knowledge, the ﬁrst-ever large-scale study of happiness in daily life. One major ﬁnding is that people's minds wander nearly half the time, and this appears to lower their mood. Wandering to unpleasant or even neutral topics is associated with sharply lower happiness; straying to positive topics has no eﬀect either way. The amount of mind-wandering varies greatly depending on the activity, from roughly 60% of the time while com- muting to 30% when talking to someone or playing a game to 10% during sex. But no matter what people are doing, they are much less happy when their minds are wandering than when their minds are focused. All of this strongly suggests that to optimize our emotional well-being, we should pay at least as much

                          48

The Science Behind the Smile

attention to where our minds are as to what our bod- ies are doing. Yet for most of us, the focus of our thoughts isn't part of our daily planning. When you wake up on a Saturday morning and ask, "What am I going to do today?" the answer is usually about where you'll take your body---to the beach, to the kids' soccer practice, for a run. You ought to also ask, "What am I going to do with my mind today?" A related stream of research examines the rela- tionship between mind-wandering and productivity. Many managers, particularly those whose employees do creative knowledge work, may sense that a certain amount of daydreaming is a good thing, providing a mental break and perhaps leading people to reﬂect on related work matters. Unfortunately, the data so far suggest that, in addition to reducing happiness, mind-wandering on the job reduces productivity. And employees' minds stray much more than managers (Continued)

                           49

Happiness

probably imagine---about 50% of the workday---and almost always veer toward personal concerns. Man- agers may want to look for ways to help employees stay focused, for the employees' and the company's sakes. The data are also beginning to paint a picture of variations in happiness within an individual and from one individual to the next. The most striking ﬁnding here is that happiness diﬀers more from moment to moment than it does from person to person. This sug- gests that it's not the stable conditions of our lives, such as where we live or whether we're married, that are the principal drivers of happiness; it could be the small, everyday things that count the most. It also suggests that happiness on the job may de- pend more on our moment-to-moment experiences--- our routine interactions with coworkers, the projects we're involved in, our daily contributions---than on the

    The Power of
     Small Wins

By Teresa M. Amabile and Steven J. Kramer

                   53

W hat is the best way to drive innovative work inside organizations? Important clues hide in the stories of world- renowned creators. It turns out that ordinary sci- entists, marketers, programmers, and other unsung knowledge workers, whose jobs require creative productivity every day, have more in common with famous innovators than most managers realize. The workday events that ignite their emotions, fuel their motivation, and trigger their perceptions are funda- mentally the same. The Double Helix, James Watson's 1968 memoir about discovering the structure of DNA, describes

                         55

Happiness

the roller coaster of emotions he and Francis Crick experienced through the progress and setbacks of the work that eventually earned them the Nobel Prize. After the excitement of their ﬁrst attempt to build a DNA model, Watson and Crick noticed some serious ﬂaws. According to Watson, "Our ﬁrst minutes with the models . . . were not joyous." Later that evening, "a shape began to emerge which brought back our spirits." But when they showed their "breakthrough" to colleagues, they found that their model would not work. Dark days of doubt and ebbing motivation followed. When the duo ﬁnally had their bona ﬁde breakthrough, and their colleagues found no fault with it, Watson wrote, "My morale skyrocketed, for I suspected that we now had the answer to the riddle." Watson and Crick were so driven by this success that they practically lived in the lab, trying to complete the work. Throughout these episodes, Watson and Crick's progress---or lack thereof---ruled their reactions. In

                         56

The Power of Small Wins

our recent research on creative work inside busi- nesses, we stumbled upon a remarkably similar phenomenon. Through exhaustive analysis of diaries kept by knowledge workers, we discovered the "prog- ress principle": Of all the things that can boost emo- tions, motivation, and perceptions during a work- day, the single most important is making progress in meaningful work. And the more frequently people experience that sense of progress, the more likely they are to be creatively productive in the long run. Whether they are trying to solve a major scientiﬁc mystery or simply produce a high-quality product or service, everyday progress---even a small win---can make all the difference in how they feel and perform. The power of progress is fundamental to human nature, but few managers understand it or know how to leverage progress to boost motivation. In fact, work motivation has been a subject of long-standing debate. In a survey asking about the keys to motivat- ing workers, we found that some managers ranked

                           57

Happiness

recognition for good work as most important, while others put more stock in tangible incentives. Some focused on the value of interpersonal support, while still others thought clear goals were the answer. Interestingly, very few of our surveyed managers ranked progress ﬁrst. (See the sidebar "A Surprise for Managers.") If you are a manager, the progress principle holds clear implications for where to focus your efforts. It suggests that you have more inﬂuence than you may realize over employees' well-being, motivation, and creative output. Knowing what serves to catalyze and nourish progress---and what does the opposite--- turns out to be the key to effectively managing people and their work. In this article, we share what we have learned about the power of progress and how managers can leverage it. We spell out how a focus on progress translates into concrete managerial actions and pro- vide a checklist to help make such behaviors habitual. But to clarify why those actions are so potent, we ﬁrst

           A SURPRISE FOR MANAGERS

In a 1968 issue of HBR, Frederick Herzberg published a now-classic article titled "One More Time: How Do you Motivate Employees?" Our ﬁndings are consis- tent with his message: People are most satisﬁed with their jobs (and therefore most motivated) when those jobs give them the opportunity to experience achieve- ment. The diary research we describe in this article--- in which we microscopically examined the events of thousands of workdays, in real time---uncovered the mechanism underlying the sense of achievement: making consistent, meaningful progress. But managers seem not to have taken Herzberg's lesson to heart. To assess contemporary awareness of the importance of daily work progress, we recently ad- ministered a survey to 669 managers of varying levels from dozens of companies around the world. We asked about the managerial tools that can aﬀect employees' (Continued)

motivation and emotions. The respondents ranked ﬁve tools---support for making progress in the work, recognition for good work, incentives, interpersonal support, and clear goals---in order of importance. Of the managers who took our survey, 95% would probably be surprised to learn that supporting prog- ress is the primary way to elevate motivation---be- cause that's the percentage who failed to rank prog- ress number one. In fact, only 35 managers ranked progress as the number one motivator---a mere 5%. The vast majority of respondents ranked support for making progress dead last as a motivator and third as an inﬂuence on emotion. They ranked "recognition for good work (either public or private)" as the most im- portant factor in motivating workers and making them happy. In our diary study, recognition certainly did boost inner work life. But it wasn't nearly as promi- nent as progress. Besides, without work achieve- ments, there is little to recognize.

describe our research and what the knowledge work- ers' diaries revealed about their "inner work lives."

      Inner work life and performance

For nearly 15 years, we have been studying the psycho- logical experiences and the performance of people do- ing complex work inside organizations. Early on, we realized that a central driver of creative, productive performance was the quality of a person's inner work life: the mix of emotions, motivations, and perceptions over the course of a workday. How happy workers feel; how motivated they are by an intrinsic interest in the work; how positively they view their organiza- tion, their management, their team, their work, and themselves---all these combine either to push them to higher levels of achievement or to drag them down. To understand such interior dynamics better, we asked members of project teams to respond individu- ally to an end-of-day email survey during the course

                            61

Happiness

of the project---just over four months, on average. (For more on this research, see our article "Inner Work Life: Understanding the Subtext of Business Performance," HBR May 2007.) The projects---in- venting kitchen gadgets, managing product lines of cleaning tools, and solving complex IT problems for a hotel empire, for example---all involved creativity. The daily survey inquired about participants' emotions and moods, motivation levels, and perceptions of the work environment that day, as well as what work they did and what events stood out in their minds. Twenty-six project teams from seven companies participated, comprising 238 individuals. This yielded nearly 12,000 diary entries. Naturally, every indi- vidual in our population experienced ups and downs. Our goal was to discover the states of inner work life and the workday events that correlated with the highest levels of creative output. In a dramatic rebuttal to the commonplace claim that high pressure and fear spur achievement, we

                          62

The Power of Small Wins

found that, at least in the realm of knowledge work, people are more creative and productive when their inner work lives are positive---when they feel happy, are intrinsically motivated by the work itself, and have positive perceptions of their colleagues and the organization. Moreover, in those positive states, peo- ple are more committed to the work and more col- legial toward those around them. Inner work life, we saw, can ﬂuctuate from one day to the next--- some- times wildly---and performance along with it. A per- son's inner work life on a given day fuels his or her performance for the day and can even affect perfor- mance the next day. Once this "inner work-life effect" became clear, our inquiry turned to whether and how managerial ac- tion could set it in motion. What events could evoke positive or negative emotions, motivations, and per- ceptions? The answers were tucked within our re- search participants' diary entries. There are predict- able triggers that inﬂate or deﬂate inner work life,

                           63

Happiness

and, even accounting for variation among individu- als, they are pretty much the same for everyone.

            The power of progress

Our hunt for inner work-life triggers led us to the progress principle. When we compared our research participants' best and worst days (based on their overall mood, speciﬁc emotions, and motivation lev- els), we found that the most common event triggering a "best day" was any progress in the work by the indi- vidual or the team. The most common event trigger- ing a "worst day" was a setback. Consider, for example, how progress relates to one component of inner work life: overall mood rat- ings. Steps forward occurred on 76% of people's best- mood days. By contrast, setbacks occurred on only 13% of those days. (See the ﬁgure "What happens on good days and bad days?")

                         64

The Power of Small Wins

Two other types of inner work-life triggers also oc- cur frequently on best days: catalysts, actions that directly support work, including help from a person or group, and nourishers, events such as shows of respect and words of encouragement. Each has an opposite: inhibitors, actions that fail to support or actively hinder work, and toxins, discouraging or un- dermining events. Whereas catalysts and inhibitors are directed at the project, nourishers and toxins are directed at the person. Like setbacks, inhibitors and toxins are rare on days of great inner work life. Events on worst-mood days are nearly the mirror image of those on best-mood days. Here, setbacks predominated, occurring on 67% of those days; prog- ress occurred on only 25% of them. Inhibitors and toxins also marked many worst-mood days, and cata- lysts and nourishers were rare. This is the progress principle made visible: If a person is motivated and happy at the end of a work- day, it's a good bet that he or she made some progress.

                            65

Happiness

If the person drags out of the ofﬁce disengaged and joyless, a setback is most likely to blame. When we analyzed all 12,000 daily surveys ﬁlled out by our participants, we discovered that progress and setbacks inﬂuence all three aspects of inner work life. On days when they made progress, our partici- pants reported more positive emotions. They not only were in a more upbeat mood in general but also ex- pressed more joy, warmth, and pride. When they suf- fered setbacks, they experienced more frustration, fear, and sadness. Motivations were also affected: On progress days, people were more intrinsically motivated---by inter- est in and enjoyment of the work itself. On setback days, they were not only less intrinsically motivated but also less extrinsically motivated by recognition. Apparently, setbacks can lead a person to feel gener- ally apathetic and disinclined to do the work at all. Perceptions differed in many ways, too. On prog- ress days, people perceived signiﬁcantly more positive

What happens on good days and bad days? Progress---even a small step forward---occurs on many of the days people report being in a good mood. Events on bad days---setbacks and other hindrances---are nearly the mirror image of those on good days.

challenge in their work. They saw their teams as more mutually supportive and reported more posi- tive interactions between the teams and their super- visors. On a number of dimensions, perceptions suf- fered when people encountered setbacks. They found less positive challenge in the work, felt that they had less freedom in carrying it out, and reported that they had insufﬁcient resources. On setback days, partici- pants perceived both their teams and their supervi- sors as less supportive. To be sure, our analyses establish correlations but do not prove causality. Were these changes in inner work life the result of progress and setbacks, or was the effect the other way around? The numbers alone cannot answer that. However, we do know, from read- ing thousands of diary entries, that more-positive perceptions, a sense of accomplishment, satisfaction, happiness, and even elation often followed progress. Here's a typical post-progress entry, from a program- mer: "I smashed that bug that's been frustrating me

                           68

The Power of Small Wins

for almost a calendar week. That may not be an event to you, but I live a very drab life, so I'm all hyped." Likewise, we saw that deteriorating perceptions, frustration, sadness, and even disgust often followed setbacks. As another participant, a product mar- keter, wrote, "We spent a lot of time updating the cost reduction project list, and after tallying all the numbers, we are still coming up short of our goal. It is discouraging to not be able to hit it after all the time spent and hard work." Almost certainly, the causality goes both ways, and managers can use this feedback loop between prog- ress and inner work life to support both.

                 Minor milestones

When we think about progress, we often imagine how good it feels to achieve a long-term goal or experience a major breakthrough. These big wins are great---but

                             69

Happiness

they are relatively rare. The good news is that even small wins can boost inner work life tremendously. Many of the progress events our research participants reported represented only minor steps forward. Yet they often evoked outsize positive reactions. Consider this diary entry from a programmer in a high-tech company, which was accompanied by very positive self-ratings of her emotions, motivations, and per- ceptions that day: "I ﬁgured out why something was not working correctly. I felt relieved and happy be- cause this was a minor milestone for me." Even ordinary, incremental progress can increase people's engagement in the work and their happiness during the workday. Across all the types of events our participants reported, a notable proportion (28%) that had a minor impact on the project had a major impact on people's feelings about it. Because inner work life has such a potent effect on creativity and productivity, and because small but consistent steps

                         70

The Power of Small Wins

forward shared by many people can accumulate into excellent execution, progress events that often go unnoticed are critical to the overall performance of organizations. Unfortunately, there is a ﬂip side. Small losses or setbacks can have an extremely negative effect on inner work life. In fact, our study and research by others show that negative events can have a more powerful impact than positive ones. Consequently, it is especially important for managers to minimize daily hassles. (See again the ﬁgure "What happens on good days and bad days?")

        Progress in meaningful work

We've shown how gratifying it is for workers when they are able to chip away at a goal, but recall what we said earlier: The key to motivating performance

                           71

Happiness

is supporting progress in meaningful work. Making headway boosts your inner work life, but only if the work matters to you. Think of the most boring job you've ever had. Many people nominate their ﬁrst job as a teenager--- washing pots and pans in a restaurant kitchen, for example, or checking coats at a museum. In jobs like those, the power of progress seems elusive. No mat- ter how hard you work, there are always more pots to wash and coats to check; only punching the time clock at the end of the day or getting the paycheck at the end of the week yields a sense of accomplishment. In jobs with much more challenge and room for creativity, like the ones our research participants had, simply "making progress"---getting tasks done--- doesn't guarantee a good inner work life, either. You may have experienced this rude fact in your own job, on days (or in projects) when you felt demotivated, devalued, and frustrated, even though you worked hard and got things done. The likely

                          72

The Power of Small Wins

cause is your perception of the completed tasks as peripheral or irrelevant. For the progress principle to operate, the work must be meaningful to the person doing it. In 1983, Steve Jobs was trying to entice John Scul- ley to leave a wildly successful career at PepsiCo to become Apple's new CEO. Jobs reportedly asked him, "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world?" In making his pitch, Jobs leveraged a potent psychological force: the deep-seated human desire to do meaningful work. Fortunately, to feel meaningful, work doesn't have to involve putting the ﬁrst personal computers in the hands of ordinary people, or alleviating poverty, or helping to cure cancer. Work with less profound importance to society can matter if it contributes value to something or someone important to the worker. Meaning can be as simple as making a useful and high-quality product for a customer or providing

                           73

Happiness

a genuine service for a community. It can be support- ing a colleague or boosting an organization's proﬁts by reducing inefﬁciencies in a production process. Whether the goals are lofty or modest, as long as they are meaningful to the worker and it is clear how his or her efforts contribute to them, progress toward them can galvanize inner work life. In principle, managers shouldn't have to go to extraordinary lengths to infuse jobs with meaning. Most jobs in modern organizations are potentially meaningful for the people doing them. However, managers can make sure that employees know just how their work is contributing. And, most impor- tant, they can avoid actions that negate its value. (See the sidebar "How Work Gets Stripped of Its Mean- ing.") All the participants in our research were doing work that should have been meaningful; no one was washing pots or checking coats. Shockingly often, however, we saw potentially important, challenging work losing its power to inspire.

                          74

HOW WORK GETS STRIPPED OF ITS MEANING

Diary entries from 238 knowledge workers who were members of creative project teams revealed four pri- mary ways in which managers unwittingly drain work of its meaning. Managers may dismiss the importance of employ- ees' work or ideas. Consider the case of Richard, a senior lab technician at a chemical company, who found meaning in helping his new-product develop- ment team solve complex technical problems. How- ever, in team meetings over the course of a three- week period, Richard perceived that his team leader was ignoring his suggestions and those of his team- mates. As a result, he felt that his contributions were not meaningful, and his spirits ﬂagged. When at last he believed that he was again making a substantive contribution to the success of the project, his mood (Continued)

                            75

Happiness

improved dramatically: "I felt much better at today's team meeting. I felt that my opinions and information were important to the project and that we have made some progress." They may destroy employees' sense of owner- ship of their work. Frequent and abrupt reassign- ments often have this eﬀect. This happened repeat- edly to the members of a product development team in a giant consumer products company, as de- scribed by team member Bruce: "As I've been hand- ing over some projects, I do realize that I don't like to give them up. Especially when you have been with them from the start and are nearly to the end. You lose ownership. This happens to us way too often." Managers may send the message that the work employees are doing will never see the light of day. They can signal this---unintentionally---by shifting

                         76

The Power of Small Wins

their priorities or changing their minds about how something should be done. We saw the latter in an internet technology company after user-interface developer Burt had spent weeks designing seamless transitions for non-English-speaking users. Not sur- prisingly, Burt's mood was seriously marred on the day he reported this incident: "Other options for the inter- national \[interfaces\] were \[given\] to the team during a team meeting, which could render the work I am do- ing useless." They may neglect to inform employees about unexpected changes in a customer's priorities. Of- ten, this arises from poor customer management or inadequate communication within the company. For example, Stuart, a data transformation expert at an IT company, reported deep frustration and low (Continued)

                           77

Happiness

motivation on the day he learned that weeks of the team's hard work might have been for naught: "Found out that there is a strong possibility that the project may not be going forward, due to a shift in the client's agenda. Therefore, there is a strong possibility that all the time and eﬀort put into the project was a waste of our time."

               Supporting progress:
              catalysts and nourishers

What can managers do to ensure that people are mo- tivated, committed, and happy? How can they sup- port workers' daily progress? They can use catalysts and nourishers, the other kinds of frequent "best day" events we discovered.

                            78

The Power of Small Wins

Catalysts are actions that support work. They in- clude setting clear goals, allowing autonomy, provid- ing sufﬁcient resources and time, helping with the work, openly learning from problems and successes, and allowing a free exchange of ideas. Their oppo- sites, inhibitors, include failing to provide support and actively interfering with the work. Because of their impact on progress, catalysts and inhibitors ultimately affect inner work life. But they also have a more immediate impact: When people realize that they have clear and meaningful goals, sufﬁcient resources, helpful colleagues, and so on, they get an instant boost to their emotions, their motivation to do a great job, and their perceptions of the work and the organization. Nourishers are acts of interpersonal support, such as respect and recognition, encouragement, emo- tional comfort, and opportunities for afﬁliation. Toxins, their opposites, include disrespect, discour- agement, disregard for emotions, and interpersonal

                              79

Happiness

conﬂict. For good and for ill, nourishers and toxins affect inner work life directly and immediately. Catalysts and nourishers---and their opposites--- can alter the meaningfulness of work by shifting peo- ple's perceptions of their jobs and even themselves. For instance, when a manager makes sure that peo- ple have the resources they need, it signals to them that what they are doing is important and valuable. When managers recognize people for the work they do, it signals that they are important to the organi- zation. In this way, catalysts and nourishers can lend greater meaning to the work---and amplify the opera- tion of the progress principle. The managerial actions that constitute catalysts and nourishers are not particularly mysterious; they may sound like Management 101, if not just common sense and common decency. But our diary study re- minded us how often they are ignored or forgotten. Even some of the more attentive managers in the companies we studied did not consistently provide

                          80

The Power of Small Wins

catalysts and nourishers. For example, a supply chain specialist named Michael was, in many ways and on most days, an excellent subteam manager. But he was occasionally so overwhelmed that he became toxic to- ward his people. When a supplier failed to complete a "hot" order on time and Michael's team had to resort to air shipping to meet the customer's deadline, he realized that the proﬁt margin on the sale would be blown. In irritation, he lashed out at his subordi- nates, demeaning the solid work they had done and disregarding their own frustration with the supplier. In his diary, he admitted as much: "As of Friday, we have spent \$28,000 in air freight to send 1,500 \$30 spray jet mops to our number two customer. Another 2,800 remain on this order, and there is a good prob- ability that they too will gain wings. I have turned from the kindly supply chain manager into the black-masked executioner. All similarity to civility is gone, our backs are against the wall, ﬂight is not pos- sible, therefore ﬁght is probable."

                            81

Happiness

Even when managers don't have their backs against the wall, developing long-term strategy and launch- ing new initiatives can often seem more important--- and perhaps sexier---than making sure subordinates have what they need to make steady progress and feel supported as human beings. But as we saw repeat- edly in our research, even the best strategy will fail if managers ignore the people working in the trenches to execute it.

           A model manager—and a
            tool for emulating him

We could explain the many (and largely unsurpris- ing) moves that can catalyze progress and nourish spirits, but it may be more useful to give an example of a manager who consistently used those moves--- and then to provide a simple tool that can help any manager do so.

                           82

The Power of Small Wins

Our model manager is Graham, whom we observed leading a small team of chemical engineers within a multinational European ﬁrm we'll call Kruger-Bern. The mission of the team's NewPoly project was clear and meaningful enough: Develop a safe, biodegrad- able polymer to replace petrochemicals in cosmetics and, eventually, in a wide range of consumer prod- ucts. As in many large ﬁrms however, the project was nested in a confusing and sometimes threatening corporate setting of shifting top-management priori- ties, conﬂicting signals, and wavering commitments. Resources were uncomfortably tight, and uncertainty loomed over the project's future---and every team member's career. Even worse, an incident early in the project, in which an important customer reacted an- grily to a sample, left the team reeling. Yet Graham was able to sustain team members' inner work lives by repeatedly and visibly removing obstacles, materi- ally supporting progress, and emotionally supporting the team.

                           83

Happiness

Graham's management approach excelled in four ways. First, he established a positive climate, one event at a time, which set behavioral norms for the entire team. When the customer complaint stopped the project in its tracks, for example, he engaged immediately with the team to analyze the problem, without recriminations, and develop a plan for re- pairing the relationship. In doing so, he modeled how to respond to crises in the work: not by panick- ing or pointing ﬁngers but by identifying problems and their causes and developing a coordinated action plan. This is both a practical approach and a great way to give subordinates a sense of forward move- ment even in the face of the missteps and failures in- herent in any complex project. Second, Graham stayed attuned to his team's ev- eryday activities and progress. In fact, the nonjudg- mental climate he had established made this happen naturally. Team members updated him frequently---

                         84

The Power of Small Wins

without being asked---on their setbacks, progress, and plans. At one point, one of his hardest-working colleagues, Brady, had to abort a trial of a new mate- rial because he couldn't get the parameters right on the equipment. It was bad news, because the New- Poly team had access to the equipment only one day a week, but Brady immediately informed Graham. In his diary entry that evening, Brady noted, "He didn't like the lost week but seemed to understand." That understanding assured Graham's place in the stream of information that would allow him to give his peo- ple just what they needed to make progress. Third, Graham targeted his support according to recent events in the team and the project. Each day, he could anticipate what type of intervention---a catalyst or the removal of an inhibitor; a nourisher or some antidote to a toxin---would have the most impact on team members' inner work lives and progress. And if he could not make that judgment, he asked. Most days

                           85

Happiness

it was not hard to ﬁgure out, as on the day he received some uplifting news about his bosses' commitment to the project. He knew the team was jittery about a rumored corporate reorganization and could use the encouragement. Even though the clariﬁcation came during a well-earned vacation day, he immediately got on the phone to relay the good news to the team. Finally, Graham established himself as a resource for team members rather than a micromanager; he was sure to check in while never seeming to check up on them. Superﬁcially, checking in and checking up seem quite similar, but micromanagers make four kinds of mistakes. First, they fail to allow autonomy in carrying out the work. Unlike Graham, who gave the NewPoly team a clear strategic goal but respected members' ideas about how to meet it, micromanagers dictate every move. Second, they frequently ask sub- ordinates about their work without providing any real help. By contrast, when one of Graham's team

                          86

The Power of Small Wins

members reported problems, Graham helped ana- lyze them---remaining open to alternative interpre- tations---and often ended up helping to get things back on track. Third, micromanagers are quick to afﬁx personal blame when problems arise, leading subordinates to hide problems rather than honestly discuss how to surmount them, as Graham did with Brady. And fourth, micromanagers tend to hoard in- formation to use as a secret weapon. Few realize how damaging this is to inner work life. When subordi- nates perceive that a manager is withholding poten- tially useful information, they feel infantilized, their motivation wanes, and their work is handicapped. Graham was quick to communicate upper manage- ment's views of the project, customers' opinions and needs, and possible sources of assistance or resis- tance within and outside the organization. In all those ways, Graham sustained his team's positive emotions, intrinsic motivation, and favorable

                            87

Happiness

perceptions. His actions serve as a powerful example of how managers at any level can approach each day determined to foster progress. We know that many managers, however well- intentioned, will ﬁnd it hard to establish the habits that seemed to come so naturally to Graham. Aware- ness, of course, is the ﬁrst step. However, turning an awareness of the importance of inner work life into routine action takes discipline. With that in mind, we developed a checklist for managers to consult on a daily basis (see the sidebar "The Daily Progress Checklist"). The aim of the checklist is managing for meaningful progress, one day at a time.

               The progress loop

Inner work life drives performance; in turn, good performance, which depends on consistent progress, enhances inner work life. We call this the "progress

                         88

The Power of Small Wins

loop"---it reveals the potential for self-reinforcing beneﬁts. So, the most important implication of the progress principle is this: By supporting people and their daily progress in meaningful work, managers improve not only the inner work lives of their employees but also the organization's long-term performance, which en- hances inner work life even more. Of course, there is a dark side---the possibility of negative feedback loops. If managers fail to support progress and the people trying to make it, inner work life suffers and so does performance; and degraded performance fur- ther undermines inner work life. A second implication of the progress principle is that managers needn't fret about trying to read the psyches of their workers or manipulate complicated incentive schemes to ensure that employees are mo- tivated and happy. As long as managers show basic respect and consideration, they can focus on support- ing the work itself.

                            89

Happiness

To become an effective manager, you must learn to set this positive feedback loop in motion. That may require a signiﬁcant shift. Business schools, business books, and managers themselves usually focus on managing organizations or people. But if you focus on managing progress, the management of people---and even of entire organizations---becomes much more feasible. You won't have to ﬁgure out how to x-ray the inner work lives of subordinates; if you facilitate their steady progress in meaningful work, make that prog- ress salient to them, and treat them well, they will ex- perience the emotions, motivations, and perceptions necessary for great performance. Their superior work will contribute to organizational success. And here's the beauty of it: They will love their jobs.

Near the end of each workday, use this checklist to re- view the day and plan your managerial actions for the next day. After a few days, you will be able to identify issues by scanning the boldface words. First, focus on progress and setbacks and think about speciﬁc events (catalysts, nourishers, inhibi- tors, and toxins) that contributed to them. Next, con- sider any clear inner-work-life clues and what further information they provide about progress and other events. Finally, prioritize for action. The action plan for the next day is the most impor- tant part of your daily review: What is the one thing you can do to best facilitate progress? (Continued)

    Performance

By Gretchen Spreitzer and Christine Porath

W hen the economy's in terrible shape, when any of us is lucky to have a job---let alone one that's ﬁnancially and intellectually rewarding---worrying about whether or not your employees are happy might seem a little over the top. But in our research into what makes for a con- sistently high-performing workforce, we've found good reason to care: Happy employees produce more than unhappy ones over the long term. They routinely show up at work, they're less likely to quit, they go above and beyond the call of duty, and they attract people who are just as committed to the job. Moreover, they're not sprinters; they're more like marathon runners, in it for the long haul.

                         101

Happiness

So what does it mean to be happy in your job? It's not about contentment, which connotes a degree of complacency. When we and our research partners at the Ross School of Business's Center for Positive Organizational Scholarship started looking into the factors involved in sustainable individual and organi- zational performance, we found a better word: thriv- ing. We think of a thriving workforce as one in which employees are not just satisﬁed and productive but also engaged in creating the future---the company's and their own. Thriving employees have a bit of an edge: They are highly energized---but they know how to avoid burnout. Across industries and job types, we found that peo- ple who ﬁt our description of thriving demonstrated 16% better overall performance (as reported by their managers) and 125% less burnout (self-reported) than their peers. They were 32% more committed to the organization and 46% more satisﬁed with their jobs. They also missed much less work and reported

                         102

Creating Sustainable Performance

signiﬁcantly fewer doctor visits, which meant health care savings and less lost time for the company. We've identiﬁed two components of thriving. The ﬁrst is vitality: the sense of being alive, passionate, and excited. Employees who experience vitality spark energy in themselves and others. Companies gener- ate vitality by giving people the sense that what they do on a daily basis makes a difference. The second component is learning: the growth that comes from gaining new knowledge and skills. Learn- ing can bestow a technical advantage and status as an expert. Learning can also set in motion a virtuous cycle: People who are developing their abilities are likely to believe in their potential for further growth. The two qualities work in concert; one with- out the other is unlikely to be sustainable and may even damage performance. Learning, for instance, creates momentum for a time, but without passion it can lead to burnout. What will I do with what I've learned? Why should I stick with this job? Vitality

alone---even when you love the kudos you get for de- livering results---can be deadening: When the work doesn't give you opportunities to learn, it's just the same thing over and over again. The combination of vitality and learning leads to employees who deliver results and ﬁnd ways to grow. Their work is rewarding not just because they suc- cessfully perform what's expected of them today but also because they have a sense of where they and the company are headed. In short, they are thriving, and the energy they create is contagious. (See the sidebar "About the Research.")

         How organizations can help
             employees thrive

Some employees thrive no matter the context. They naturally build vitality and learning into their jobs, and they inspire the people around them. A smart

               ABOUT THE RESEARCH

Over the past seven years, we have been researching the nature of thriving in the workplace and the factors that enhance or inhibit it. Across several studies with our colleagues Cris- tina Gibson and Flannery Garnett, we surveyed or interviewed more than 1,200 white- and blue- collar employees in an array of industries, including higher education, health care, ﬁnancial services, maritime, energy, and manufacturing. We also stud- ied metrics reﬂecting energy, learning, and growth, based on information supplied by employees and bosses, along with retention rates, health, over- all job performance, and organizational citizenship behaviors. We developed a deﬁnition of thriving that breaks the concept into two factors: vitality---the sense that (Continued)

                          105

Happiness

you're energized and alive; and learning---the gaining of knowledge and skills. When you put the two together, the statistics are striking. For example, people who were high energy and high learning were 21% more eﬀective as leaders than those who were only high energy. The outcomes on one measure in particular---health---were even more extreme. Those who were high energy and low learning were 54% worse when it came to health than those who were high in both.

hiring manager will look for those people. But most employees are inﬂuenced by their environment. Even those predisposed to ﬂourish can fold under pressure. The good news is that---without heroic measures or major ﬁnancial investments---leaders and managers

                            106

Creating Sustainable Performance

can jump-start a culture that encourages employees to thrive. That is, managers can overcome organiza- tional inertia to promote thriving and the produc- tivity that follows it---in many cases with a relatively modest shift in attention. Ideally, you'd be blessed with a workforce full of people who naturally thrive. But there's a lot you can do to release and sustain enthusiasm. Our research has uncovered four mechanisms that create the con- ditions for thriving employees: providing decision- making discretion, sharing information, minimizing incivility, and offering performance feedback. The mechanisms overlap somewhat. For instance, if you let people make decisions but give them incomplete information, or leave them exposed to hostile reac- tions, they'll suffer rather than thrive. One mecha- nism by itself will get you part of the way, but all four are necessary to create a culture of thriving. Let's look at each in turn.

                           107

Happiness

          Providing decision-making
                  discretion

Employees at every level are energized by the ability to make decisions that affect their work. Empowering them in this way gives them a greater sense of control, more say in how things get done, and more opportu- nities for learning. The airline industry might seem like an unlikely place to ﬁnd decision-making discretion (let alone a thriving workforce), but consider one company we studied, Alaska Airlines, which created a culture of empowerment that has contributed to a major turnaround over the past decade. In the early 2000s the airline's numbers were ﬂagging, so senior man- agement launched the 2010 Plan, which explicitly invited employee input into decisions that would improve service while maintaining a reputation for timely departures. Employees were asked to set aside

                         108

Creating Sustainable Performance

their current perceptions of "good" service and con- sider new ways to contribute, coming up with ideas that could take service from good to truly great. Agents embraced the program, which gave them, for instance, the discretion to ﬁnd solutions for custom- ers who had missed ﬂights or were left behind for any other reason. Ron Calvin, the director of the eastern region, told us of a call he had recently received on his cell phone from a customer he hadn't seen or spoken to since working at the Seattle airport, ﬁve years ear- lier. The customer had a three-month-old grandchild who had just gone into cardiac arrest. The grandpar- ents were trying to get back to Seattle from Honolulu. Everything was booked. Ron made a few calls and got them on a ﬂight right away. That day the grandfather sent Ron a text saying, simply, "We made it." Efforts like this to meet individual needs with- out holding up ﬂights have led to a number one rat- ing for on-time performance and a full trophy case. The airline has also expanded considerably into new

markets, including Hawaii, the Midwest, and the East Coast. Southwest is a better-known story, largely because of the company's reputation for having a fun and car- ing culture. Flight attendants are often eager to sing, joke around, and in general entertain customers. They also radiate energy and a passion for learning. One decided to offer the preﬂight safety instructions in rap format. He was motivated to put his special talents to work, and the passengers loved it, report- ing that it was the ﬁrst time they had actually paid attention to the instructions. At Facebook, decision-making discretion is fun- damental to the culture. One employee posted a note on the site expressing his surprise, and pleasure, at the company's motto, "Move fast and break things," which encourages employees to make decisions and act. On just his second day of work, he found a ﬁx to a complicated bug. He expected some sort of hierarchi- cal review, but his boss, the vice president of product,

                          110

Creating Sustainable Performance

just smiled and said, "Ship it." He marveled that so early on he had delivered a solution that would in- stantly reach millions of people. The challenge for managers is to avoid cutting back on empowerment when people make mistakes. Those situations create the best conditions for learn- ing---not only for the parties concerned but also for others, who can learn vicariously.

              Sharing information

Doing your job in an information vacuum is tedious and uninspiring; there's no reason to look for inno- vative solutions if you can't see the larger impact. People can contribute more effectively when they understand how their work ﬁts with the organiza- tion's mission and strategy. Alaska Airlines has chosen to invest management time in helping employees gain a broad view of the

                           111

Happiness

company's strategy. The 2010 Plan was launched with traditional communications but also with a months-long road show and training classes de- signed to help employees share ideas. The CEO, the president, and the COO still go on the road quarterly to gather information about the idiosyncrasies of various markets; they then disseminate what they've learned. The beneﬁts show up in yearly measures of employee pride in the company---now knocking it out of the park at 90%. At Zingerman's (an Ann Arbor, Michigan, com- munity of food-related businesses that has worked closely with Wayne Baker, a colleague of ours at the Center for Positive Organizational Scholarship), in- formation is as transparent as possible. The organi- zation had never consciously withheld its numbers--- ﬁnancial information was tacked up for employees to see---but when cofounders Ari Weinzweig and Paul Saginaw studied open book management in the mid-

                        112

Creating Sustainable Performance

1990s, they came to believe that employees would show more interest if they got involved in the "game." Implementation of a more formal and meaningful open book policy was not easy. People could look at the numbers, but they had little reason to pay atten- tion and didn't get much insight into how the data re- lated to their daily work. For the ﬁrst ﬁve or six years, the company struggled to build the concept into its systems and routines and to wrap people's minds around what Baker calls "the rigor of the huddle": weekly gatherings around a whiteboard at which teams track results, "keep score," and forecast the next week's numbers. Although people understood the rules of open book management, at ﬁrst they didn't see the point of adding yet another meeting to their busy schedules. It wasn't until senior lead- ers made huddling non-negotiable that employees grasped the true purpose of the whiteboards, which displayed not just ﬁnancial ﬁgures but also service

                           113

Happiness

and food quality measures, check averages, internal satisfaction ﬁgures, and "fun," which could mean any- thing from weekly contests to customer satisfaction ratings to employees' ideas for innovation. Some Zingerman's businesses began instituting "mini games": short-term incentives to ﬁnd a prob- lem or capitalize on an opportunity. For instance, the staff at Zingerman's Roadhouse restaurant used the greeter game to track how long it took for custom- ers to be greeted. "Ungreeted" customers expressed less satisfaction, and employees found themselves frequently comping purchases to make up for ser- vice lapses. The greeter game challenged the host team to greet every customer within ﬁve minutes of being seated, with a modest ﬁnancial reward for 50 straight days of success. It inspired hosts to quickly uncover and ﬁll holes in the service process. Service scores improved considerably over the course of a month. Other Zingerman's businesses started similar games, with incentives for faster delivery, fewer knife

                         114

Creating Sustainable Performance

injuries in the bakery (which would lower insurance costs), and neater kitchens. The games have naturally created some internal tensions by delivering the bad news along with the good, which can be demoralizing. But overall they have greatly increased frontline employees' sense of ownership, contributing to better performance. From 2000 to 2010 Zingerman's revenue grew by almost 300%, to more than \$35 million. The company's leaders credit open book management as a key factor in that success. Simple anecdotes lend credence to their claim. For instance, a couple of years ago we saw Ari Weinz- weig give a talk at the Roadhouse. A guest asked him whether it was realistic to expect the average waiter or busboy to understand company strategy and ﬁnance. In response, Ari turned to a busboy, who had been oblivious to the conversation: Would the teenager mind sharing Zingerman's vision and indicating how well the restaurant was meeting its weekly goals?

                           115

Happiness

Without batting an eye, the busboy stated the vision in his own words and then described how well the restaurant was doing that week on "meals sent back to the kitchen." While Zingerman's is a fairly small business, much larger ones---such as Whole Foods and the transpor- tation company YRC Worldwide---have also adopted open book management. Systems that make infor- mation widely available build trust and give employ- ees the knowledge they need to make good decisions and take initiative with conﬁdence.

              Minimizing incivility

The costs of incivility are great. In our research with Christine Pearson, a professor at Arizona State Uni- versity's Thunderbird School of Global Manage- ment, we discovered that half of employees who had experienced uncivil behavior at work intentionally

                         116

Creating Sustainable Performance

decreased their efforts. More than a third delib- erately decreased the quality of their work. Two- thirds spent a lot of time avoiding the offender, and about the same number said their performance had declined. Most people have experienced rude behavior at work. Here are a few quotes from our research:

      “My boss asked me to prepare an analysis.
      This was my ﬁrst project, and I was not given
      any instructions or examples. He told me the
      assignment was crap.”

      “My boss said, ‘If I wanted to know what you
      thought, I’d ask you.’”

      “My boss saw me remove a paper clip from
      some documents and drop it in my waste-
      basket. In front of my 12 subordinates he
      rebuked me for being wasteful and required
      me to retrieve it.”
                            117

Happiness

        “On speakerphone, in front of peers, my boss
        told me that I’d done ‘kindergarten work.’”

We have heard hundreds of stories, and they're sadly familiar to most working people. But we don't hear so much about the costs. Incivility prevents people from thriving. Those who have been the targets of bad behavior are often, in turn, uncivil themselves: They sabotage their peers. They "forget" to copy colleagues on memos. They spread gossip to deﬂect attention. Faced with incivil- ity, employees are likely to narrow their focus to avoid risks---and lose opportunities to learn in the process. A management consultancy we studied, Caiman Consulting, was founded as an alternative to the larger ﬁrms. Headquartered in Redmond, Washing- ton, in ofﬁces that are not particularly sleek, the ﬁrm is recognized for its civil culture. Background checks in its hiring process include a candidate's record of civility.

                          118

Creating Sustainable Performance

"People leave a trail," says Caiman's director, Greg Long. "You can save yourself from a corrosive culture by being careful and conscientious up front." The managing director, Raazi Imam, told us, "I have no tolerance for anyone to berate or disrespect some- one." When it does happen, he pulls the offender aside to make his policy clear. Long attributes the ﬁrm's 95% retention rate to its culture. Caiman passes up highly qualiﬁed candidates who don't match that culture. It also keeps a list of con- sultants who might be good hires when an appropri- ate spot opens up. The HR director, Meg Clara, puts strong interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence among her prime criteria for candidates. At Caiman, as at all companies, managers estab- lish the tone when it comes to civility. A single bad player can set the culture awry. One young manager told us about her boss, an executive who had a habit of yelling from his ofﬁce "You made a mistake!" for a sin as minor as a typo. His voice would resonate

                           119

Happiness

across the ﬂoor, making everyone cringe and the recipient feel acutely embarrassed. Afterward, col- leagues would gather in a common area for coffee and commiseration. An insider told us that those conversations focused not on how to get ahead at the company or learn to cope by developing a thick skin but on how to get even and get out. In our research, we were surprised by how few companies consider civility---or incivility---when eval- uating candidates. Corporate culture is inherently contagious; employees assimilate to their environ- ment. In other words, if you hire for civility, you're more likely to breed it into your culture.

     INDIVIDUAL STRATEGIES FOR THRIVING

Although organizations beneﬁt from enabling employ- ees to thrive, leaders have so much on their plates that attention to this important task can slip. How- ever, anyone can adopt strategies to enhance learning and vitality without signiﬁcant organizational support. And because thriving can be contagious, you may ﬁnd your ideas quickly spreading.

Take a break Research by Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz has shown that breaks and other renewal tactics, no matter how small, can create positive energy. In our teaching, we let students design regular breaks and activities into the class to ensure that they stay energized. In one term, students decided to halt every class for two minutes at the midpoint to get up and do something active. Each week a diﬀerent (Continued)

foursome designed the quick activity---watching a funny YouTube video, doing the cha-cha slide, or play- ing a game. The point is that the students ﬁgure out what is energizing for them and share it with the class. Even if your organization doesn't oﬀer formal mechanisms for renewal, it's nearly always possible to schedule a short walk, a bike ride, or a quick lunch in the park. Some people write it into their schedules so that meetings can't impinge.

Craft your own work to be more meaningful You can't ignore the requirements of your job, but you can watch for opportunities to make it more meaningful. Consider Tina, the staﬀ administrator of a policy think tank within a large organization. When her boss took a six-month sabbatical, Tina needed to ﬁnd a short-term replacement project. After some

                          122

Creating Sustainable Performance

scouting, she uncovered a budding initiative to de- velop staﬀ members' ability to speak up with their ideas about the organization. The eﬀort needed an innovative spirit to kick it oﬀ. The pay was lower, but the nature of the work energized Tina. When her boss returned, she renegotiated the terms of her think tank job to consume only 80% of her time, leaving the rest for the staﬀ development project.

Look for opportunities to innovate and learn Breaking out of the status quo can trigger the learn- ing that is so essential to thriving. When Roger be- came the head of a prestigious high school in the Midwest, he was brimming with innovative ideas. He quickly ascertained, however, that quite a few staﬀ members were not open to new ways of doing things. (Continued)

                          123

Happiness

He made sure to listen to their concerns and tried to bring them along, but he invested more of his eﬀort in the growth and learning of those who shared his passion for breakthrough ideas. Mentoring and en- couraging them, Roger began to achieve small wins, and his initiatives gained some momentum. A few of the resisters ended up leaving the school, and others came around when they saw signs of positive change. By focusing on those bright spots rather than the points of resistance, Roger was able to launch an ef- fort that is propelling the school toward a radically diﬀerent future.

Invest in relationships that energize you All of us have colleagues who may be brilliant but are diﬃcult and corrosive to work with. Individu- als who thrive look for opportunities to work closely

                        124

Creating Sustainable Performance

with colleagues who generate energy and to mini- mize interaction with those who deplete it. In fact, when we built the research team to study thriving, we chose colleagues we enjoyed, who energized us, with whom we looked forward to spending time, and from whom we knew we could learn. We seek to build good relationships by starting every meeting with good news or expressions of gratitude.

Recognize that thriving can spill over outside the oﬃce There's evidence that high levels of engagement at work will not lessen your ability to thrive in your per- sonal life but instead can enhance it. When one of us (Gretchen) was dealing with her husband's dif- ﬁcult medical diagnosis, she found that her work, (Continued)

even though it was demanding, gave her the energy to thrive professionally and in her family life. Thriving is not a zero-sum game. People who feel energized at work often bring that energy to their lives beyond work. And people inspired by outside activities---vol- unteering, training for a race, taking a class---can bring their drive back to the oﬃce.

people's work-related activities focused on personal and organizational goals. The quicker and more di- rect the feedback, the more useful it is. The Zingerman's huddle, described earlier, is a tool for sharing near-real-time information about individual as well as business performance. Leaders outline daily ups and downs on the whiteboard, and employees are expected to "own" the numbers and come up with ideas for getting back on track when

                            126

Creating Sustainable Performance

necessary. The huddles also include "code reds" and "code greens," which document customer complaints and compliments so that all employees can learn and grow on the basis of immediate and tangible feedback. Quicken Loans, a mortgage ﬁnance company that measures and rewards employee performance like no other organization, offers continually updated per- formance feedback using two types of dashboards: a ticker and kanban reports. (Kanban, a Japanese word meaning "signal," is used frequently in operations.) The ticker has several panels that display group and individual metrics along with data feeds that show how likely an employee is to meet his or her daily goals. People are hardwired to respond to scores and goals, so the metrics help keep them energized through the day; essentially, they're competing against their own numbers. The kanban dashboard allows managers to track people's performance so that they know when an

                          127

Happiness

employee or a team needs some coaching or other type of assistance. A version of the kanban chart is also displayed on monitors, with a rotating list of the top 15 salespeople for each metric. Employees are constantly in competition to make the boards, which are almost like a video game's ranking of high scorers. Employees could feel overwhelmed or even op- pressed by the constant nature of the feedback. In- stead, the company's strong norms for civility and respect and for giving employees a say in how they accomplish their work create a context in which the feedback is energizing and promotes growth. The global law ﬁrm O'Melveny & Myers lauds the use of 360-degree evaluations in helping workers thrive. The feedback is open-ended and summarized rather than shared verbatim, which has encouraged a 97% response rate. Carla Christofferson, the manag- ing partner of the Los Angeles ofﬁces, learned from her evaluation that people saw her behavior as not matching the ﬁrm's stated commitment to work-life balance---which was causing stress among employ-

                         128

ees. She started to spend more time away from the of- ﬁce and to limit weekend work to things she could do at home. She became a role model for balance, which went a long way toward eliminating the worry of em- ployees who wanted a life outside of work.

The four mechanisms that help employees thrive don't require enormous efforts or investments. What they do require is leaders who are open to empower- ing employees and who set the tone. As we've noted, each mechanism provides a different angle that's nec- essary for thriving. You can't choose one or two from the menu; the mechanisms reinforce one another. For example, can people be comfortable making de- cisions if they don't have honest information about current numbers? Can they make effective decisions if they're worried about being ridiculed? Creating the conditions for thriving requires your concerted attention. Helping people grow and remain energized at work is valiant on its own merits---but it

can also boost your company's performance in a sus- tainable way.

The Research We've Ignored About Happiness at Work

By André Spicer and Carl Cederström

                131

R ecently, we found ourselves in motivational seminars at our respective places of employ- ment. Both events preached the gospel of hap- piness. In one, a speaker explained that happiness could make you healthier, kinder, more productive, and even more likely to get promoted. The other seminar involved mandatory dancing of the wilder kind. It was supposed to ﬁll our bodies with joy. It also prompted one of us to sneak out and take refuge in the nearest bathroom. Ever since a group of scientists switched the lights on and off at the Hawthorne factory in the mid-1920s, scholars and executives alike have been obsessed

                        133

Happiness

with increasing their employees' productivity. In particular, happiness as a way to boost productivity seems to have gained traction in corporate circles as of late.1 Firms spend money on happiness coaches, team-building exercises, gameplays, funsultants, and chief happiness ofﬁcers (yes, you'll ﬁnd one of those at Google). These activities and titles may appear jo- vial or even bizarre, but companies are taking them extremely seriously. Should they? When you look closely at the research---which we did after the dancing incident---it's not clear that en- couraging happiness at work is always a good idea. Sure, there is evidence to suggest that happy em- ployees are less likely to leave, more likely to satisfy customers, are safer, and more likely to engage in citizenship behavior.2 However, we also discovered alternate ﬁndings, which indicates that some of the taken-for-granted wisdoms about what happiness can achieve in the workplace are mere myths.

                          134

The Research We've Ignored About Happiness at Work

To start, we don't really know what happiness is or how to measure it. Measuring happiness is about as easy as taking the temperature of the soul or deter- mining the exact color of love. As historian Darrin M. McMahon shows in his illuminating book Happi- ness: A History, ever since the sixth century BC, when Croesus is said to have quipped "No one who lives is happy," this slippery concept has served as a proxy for all sorts of other concepts, from pleasure and joy to plenitude and contentment. Being happy in the mo- ment, Samuel Johnson said, could be achieved only when drunk.3 For Jean-Jacques Rousseau, happiness was to lie in a boat, drifting aimlessly, feeling like a God (not exactly the picture of productivity). There are other deﬁnitions of happiness, too, but they are neither less nor more plausible than those of Johnson or Rousseau. And just because we have more-advanced technol- ogy today doesn't mean we're any closer to pinning

                            135

Happiness

down a deﬁnition, as Will Davies reminds us in his book The Happiness Industry. He concludes that even as we have developed more-advanced tech- niques for measuring emotions and predicting be- haviors, we have also adopted increasingly simpliﬁed notions of what it means to be human, let alone what it means to pursue happiness. A brain scan that lights up may seem like it's telling us something concrete about an elusive emotion, for example, when it actu- ally isn't. Happiness doesn't necessarily lead to increased productivity. A stream of research shows some con- tradictory results about the relationship between happiness---which is often deﬁned as "job satisfac- tion"---and productivity.4 One study on British super- markets even suggests there might be a negative correlation between job satisfaction and corporate productivity: The more miserable the employees were, the better the proﬁts.5 Sure, other studies have

                         136

The Research We've Ignored About Happiness at Work

pointed in the opposite direction, saying that there is a link between feeling content with work and being productive. But even these studies, when considered as a whole, demonstrate a relatively weak correlation. Happiness can also be exhausting. The pursuit of happiness may not be wholly effective, but it doesn't really hurt, right? Wrong. Ever since the eighteenth century, people have been pointing out that the de- mand to be happy brings with it a heavy burden, a responsibility that can never be perfectly fulﬁlled. Focusing on happiness can actually make us feel less happy. A psychological experiment recently demonstrated this.6 The researchers asked their subjects to watch a ﬁlm that would usually make them happy: a ﬁg- ure skater winning a medal. But before watching the ﬁlm, half of the group was asked to read a state- ment aloud about the importance of happiness in life. The other half did not read the statement. The

                            137

Happiness

researchers were surprised to ﬁnd that those who had read the statement were actually less happy af- ter watching the ﬁlm. Essentially, when happiness becomes a duty, it can make people feel worse if they fail to accomplish it. This is particularly problematic at the present era, in which happiness is preached as a moral obliga- tion.7 As the French philosopher Pascal Bruckner put it, "Unhappiness is not only unhappiness; it is, worse yet, a failure to be happy."8 Happiness won't necessarily get you through the workday. If you've worked in a frontline customer service job, like a call center or a fast food restaurant, you know that being upbeat is not optional---it's com- pulsory. And as tiring as that may be, it makes some sense when you're in front of customers. But today, many non-customer-facing employees are also asked to be upbeat. This could have some un- foreseen consequences. One study found that people who were in a good mood were worse at picking

                           138

The Research We've Ignored About Happiness at Work

out acts of deception than those who were in a bad mood.9 Another piece of research found that people who were angry during a negotiation achieved better outcomes than people who were happy.10 This sug- gests that being happy may not be good for all aspects of our work or for jobs that rely heavily on certain abilities. In fact, in some cases, happiness can actu- ally make our performance worse. Happiness could damage your relationship with your boss. If we believe that work is where we will ﬁnd happiness, we might, in some cases, start to mis- take our boss for a surrogate spouse or parent. In her study of a media company, researcher Susanne Ekmann found that those who expected work to make them happy would often become emotionally needy.11 They wanted their managers to provide them with a steady stream of recognition and emotional re- assurance. And when they didn't receive the expected emotional response (which was often), these em- ployees felt neglected and started overreacting. Even

                           139

Happiness

minor setbacks were interpreted as being rejected by their bosses. So in many ways, expecting a boss to bring happiness makes us emotionally vulnerable. Happiness could also hurt your relationships with friends and family. In her book Cold Intimacies, sociology professor Eva Illouz points out a strange side effect of people trying to live more emotionally at work: They started to treat their private lives like work tasks. The people she spoke with saw their per- sonal lives as something that needed to be carefully administered using a range of tools and techniques they had learned from corporate life. As a result, their home lives became increasingly cold and calculat- ing. It's no wonder then that many of the people she spoke with preferred to spend time at work rather than at home. Happiness could make losing your job that much more devastating. When we expect the workplace to provide happiness and meaning in our lives, we be-

                          140

The Research We've Ignored About Happiness at Work

come dangerously dependent on it. When studying professionals, sociology professor Richard Sennett noticed that people who saw their employer as an im- portant source of personal meaning were those who became most devastated if they were ﬁred.12 When these people lost their jobs, they weren't just losing an income---they were losing the promise of happi- ness. This suggests that, when we see our work as a great source of happiness, we make ourselves emo- tionally vulnerable during periods of change. In an era of constant corporate restructuring, this can be dangerous. Happiness could also make you selﬁsh. Being happy makes you a better person, right? Not so, ac- cording to an interesting piece of research.13 Par- ticipants were given lottery tickets and then given a choice about how many tickets they wanted to give to others and how many they wished to keep for themselves. Those who were in a good mood ended

                           141

Happiness

up keeping more tickets for themselves. This implies that, at least in some settings, being happy doesn't necessarily mean we will be generous. In fact, the op- posite could be true. Finally, happiness could also make you lonely. In one experiment, psychologists asked a number of people to keep a detailed diary for two weeks. What they found at the end of the study was that those who greatly valued happiness felt lonelier than those who valued happiness less.14 It seems that focusing too much on the pursuit of happiness can make us feel disconnected from other people. So why, contrary to all of this evidence, do we con- tinue to hold on to the belief that happiness can im- prove a workplace? The answer, according to one study, comes down to aesthetics and ideology. Happi- ness is a convenient idea that looks good on paper (the aesthetic part). But it's also an idea that helps us shy away from more serious issues at work, such as con- ﬂicts and workplace politics (the ideological part).15

                          142

The Research We've Ignored About Happiness at Work

When we assume that happy workers are better workers, we may sweep more uncomfortable ques- tions under the rug, especially since happiness is often seen as a choice. It becomes a convenient way of dealing with negative attitudes, party poopers, miserable bastards, and other unwanted characters in corporate life. Invoking happiness, in all its am- biguity, is an excellent way of getting away with con- troversial decisions, such as choosing to let people go. As Barbara Ehrenreich points out in her book Bright-Sided, positive messages about happiness have proved particularly popular in times of crisis and mass layoffs. Given all these potential problems, we think there is a strong case for rethinking our expectation that work should always make us happy. It can be ex- hausting, make us overreact, drain our personal life of meaning, increase our vulnerability, and make us more gullible, selﬁsh, and lonely. Most striking is that consciously pursuing happiness can actually drain

                            143

Happiness

the sense of joy we usually get from the really good things we experience. In reality, work---like all other aspects of life---is likely to make us feel a wide range of emotions. If your job feels depressing and meaningless, it might be because it is depressing and meaningless. Pre- tending otherwise can just make it worse. Happiness, of course, is a great thing to experience, but it can't be willed into existence. Maybe the less we seek to ac- tively pursue happiness through our jobs, the more likely we will be to actually experience a sense of joy in our work---a joy that is spontaneous and pleasur- able rather than constructed and oppressive. But most important, we will be better equipped to cope with work in a sober manner. To see it for what it is and not what we---whether as executives, employees, or dancing motivational seminar leaders---pretend that it is.

The Happiness Backlash

By Alison Beard

        147

N othing depresses me more than reading about happiness. Why? Because there's entirely too much advice out there about how to achieve it. As Frédéric Lenoir points out in Happiness: A Phi- losopher's Guide (recently translated from its original French), great thinkers have been discussing this topic for more than 2,000 years. But opinions on it still differ. Just scan the 14,700 titles listed in the "hap- piness" subgenre of self-help books on Amazon, or watch the 55 TED talks tagged in the same category. What makes us happy? Health, money, social con- nection, purpose, "ﬂow," generosity, gratitude, inner peace, positive thinking . . . research shows that any

                         149

Happiness

(or all?) of the above answers are correct. Social scien- tists tell us that even the simplest of tricks---counting our blessings, meditating for 10 minutes a day, forcing smiles---can push us into a happier state of mind. And yet for me and many others, happiness re- mains elusive. Of course, I sometimes feel joyful and content---reading a bedtime story to my kids, inter- viewing someone I greatly admire, ﬁnishing a tough piece of writing. But despite having good health, sup- portive family and friends, and a stimulating and ﬂexible job, I'm often awash in negative emotions: worry, frustration, anger, disappointment, guilt, envy, regret. My default state is dissatisﬁed. The huge and growing body of happiness literature promises to lift me out of these feelings. But the ef- fect is more like kicking me when I'm down. I know I should be happy. I know I have every reason to be and that I'm better off than most. I know that hap- pier people are more successful. I know that just a few mental exercises might help me. Still, when I'm

                          150

The Happiness Backlash

in a bad mood, it's hard to break out of it. And---I'll admit---a small part of me regards my nonbliss not as unproductive negativity but as highly productive real- ism. I can't imagine being happy all the time; indeed, I'm highly suspicious of anyone who claims to be. I agreed to write this essay because over the past several years I've sensed a swell of support for this point of view. Barbara Ehrenreich's 2009 book Bright-Sided, about the "relentless promotion" and undermining effects of positive thinking, was fol- lowed last year by Rethinking Positive Thinking, by the NYU psychology professor Gabriele Oettingen, and The Upside of Your Dark Side, by two experts in positive psychology, Todd Kashdan and Robert Biswas-Diener. This year brought a terriﬁc Psychol- ogy Today article by Matthew Hutson titled "Beyond Happiness: The Upside of Feeling Down"; The Up- side of Stress, by Stanford's Kelly McGonigal; Beyond Happiness, by the British historian and commenta- tor Anthony Seldon; and The Happiness Industry:

                          151

Happiness

How the Government and Big Business Sold Us Well- Being, by another Brit, the Goldsmiths lecturer in politics William Davies. Are we ﬁnally seeing a backlash against happiness? Sort of. Most of these recent releases rail against our modern obsession with feeling happy and think- ing positively. Oettingen explains the importance of damping sunny fantasies with sober analysis of the obstacles in one's way. Kashdan and Biswas-Diener's book and Hutson's article detail the beneﬁts we derive from all the negative emotions I cited earlier; taken together, those feelings spur us to better our circum- stances and ourselves. (The Harvard psychologist Su- san David, a coauthor of the HBR article "Emotional Agility," also writes thoughtfully on this topic.) McGonigal shows how viewing one unhappy con- dition---stress---in a kinder light can turn it into some- thing that improves rather than hurts our health. Those who accept feeling stressed as the body's natu- ral response to a challenge are more resilient and live longer than those who try to ﬁght it.

                           152

The Happiness Backlash

Seldon describes his own progression from plea- sure seeking to more-meaningful endeavors that bring him (and should bring us) joy. Sadly, he trivial- izes his advice by alphabetizing it: Accepting oneself; Belonging to a group; having good Character, Disci- pline, Empathy, Focus, Generosity, and Health; using Inquiry; embarking on an inner Journey; accepting Karma; and embracing both Liturgy and Medita- tion. (One wonders what he'll use for X and Z in the next book.) Davies comes at the issue from a different angle. He's fed up with organizational attempts to tap into what is essentially a "grey mushy process inside our brains." In his view, there's something sinister about the way advertisers, HR managers, governments, and pharmaceutical companies are measuring, manipu- lating, and ultimately making money from our insa- tiable desire to be happier. But none of these authors is arguing against indi- viduals' aspiring to have a generally happy life. We call that the pursuit of "happiness," but what we really

                           153

Happiness

mean is "long-term fulﬁllment." Martin Seligman, the father of positive psychology, calls it "ﬂourishing" and said years ago that positive emotion (that is, feeling happy) is only one element of it, along with engage- ment, relationships, meaning, and achievement. In the parlance Arianna Hufﬁngton uses in her recent book, it's "thriving," and Lenoir, whose history of hap- piness philosophy is probably the most enlightening and entertaining of the bunch, describes it as sim- ply "love of life." Who can argue against any of those things? Where most of the happiness gurus go wrong is insisting that daily if not constant happiness is a means to long-term fulﬁllment. For some glass-half- full optimists, that may be true. They can "stumble on happiness" the way the ﬁeld's most prominent re- searcher, Dan Gilbert, suggests; or gain "the happi- ness advantage" that the professor-turned-consultant Shawn Achor talks about; or "broadcast happiness," as Michelle Gielan, Achor's wife and partner at the

                          154

The Happiness Backlash

ﬁrm GoodThink, recommends in her new book. As I said, it apparently takes just a few simple tricks. But for the rest of us, that much cheer feels forced, so it's unlikely to help us mold meaningful relation- ships or craft the perfect career. It certainly can't be drawn out of us by employers or other external forces. We pursue fulﬁllment in different ways, with- out reading self-help books. And I suspect that in the long run we'll be OK---perhaps even happy.

    Discovering

Your Authentic Leadership

By Bill George, Peter Sims, Andrew N. McLean, and Diana Mayer

                     1

D uring the past 50 years, leadership scholars have conducted more than 1,000 studies in an attempt to determine the deﬁnitive styles, characteristics, or personality traits of great leaders. None of these studies has produced a clear proﬁle of the ideal leader. Thank goodness. If scholars had produced a cookie-cutter leadership style, individu- als would be forever trying to imitate it. They would make themselves into personae, not people, and oth- ers would see through them immediately. No one can be authentic by trying to imitate some- one else. You can learn from others' experiences, but there is no way you can be successful when you are

                           3

Authentic Leadership

trying to be like them. People trust you when you are genuine and authentic, not a replica of someone else. Amgen CEO and president Kevin Sharer, who gained priceless experience working as Jack Welch's assistant in the 1980s, saw the downside of GE's cult of personality in those days. "Everyone wanted to be like Jack," he explains. "Leadership has many voices. You need to be who you are, not try to emulate some- body else." Over the past ﬁve years, people have developed a deep distrust of leaders. It is increasingly evident that we need a new kind of business leader in the 21st cen- tury. In 2003, Bill George's book, Authentic Leader- ship: Rediscovering the Secrets to Creating Lasting Value, challenged a new generation to lead authen- tically. Authentic leaders demonstrate a passion for their purpose, practice their values consistently, and lead with their hearts as well as their heads. They establish long-term, meaningful relationships and have the self-discipline to get results. They know who they are.

Discovering Your Authentic Leadership

Many readers of Authentic Leadership, includ- ing several CEOs, indicated that they had a tre- mendous desire to become authentic leaders and wanted to know how. As a result, our research team set out to answer the question, "How can people become and remain authentic leaders?" We inter- viewed 125 leaders to learn how they developed their leadership abilities. These interviews constitute the largest in-depth study of leadership development ever undertaken. Our interviewees discussed openly and honestly how they realized their potential and candidly shared their life stories, personal struggles, failures, and triumphs. The people we talked with ranged in age from 23 to 93, with no fewer than 15 per decade. They were chosen based on their reputations for authenticity and effectiveness as leaders, as well as our personal knowledge of them. We also solicited recommenda- tions from other leaders and academics. The resulting group includes women and men from a diverse array of racial, religious, and socioeconomic backgrounds

                             5

Authentic Leadership

and nationalities. Half of them are CEOs, and the other half comprises a range of proﬁt and nonproﬁt leaders, midcareer leaders, and young leaders just starting on their journeys. After interviewing these individuals, we believe we understand why more than 1,000 studies have not produced a proﬁle of an ideal leader. Analyzing 3,000 pages of transcripts, our team was startled to see that these people did not identify any universal characteristics, traits, skills, or styles that led to their success. Rather, their leadership emerged from their life stories. Consciously and subconsciously, they were constantly testing themselves through real-world experiences and reframing their life stories to under- stand who they were at their core. In doing so, they dis- covered the purpose of their leadership and learned that being authentic made them more effective. These ﬁndings are extremely encouraging: You do not have to be born with speciﬁc characteristics or traits of a leader. You do not have to wait for a tap on

                             6

the shoulder. You do not have to be at the top of your organization. Instead, you can discover your poten- tial right now. As one of our interviewees, Young & Rubicam chairman and CEO Ann Fudge, said, "All of us have the spark of leadership in us, whether it is in business, in government, or as a nonproﬁt volunteer. The challenge is to understand ourselves well enough to discover where we can use our leadership gifts to serve others." Discovering your authentic leadership requires a commitment to developing yourself. Like musicians and athletes, you must devote yourself to a lifetime of realizing your potential. Most people Kroger CEO David Dillon has seen become good leaders were self- taught. Dillon said, "The advice I give to individuals in our company is not to expect the company to hand you a development plan. You need to take responsi- bility for developing yourself." In the following pages, we draw upon lessons from our interviews to describe how people become

                             7

Authentic Leadership

authentic leaders. First and most important, they frame their life stories in ways that allow them to see themselves not as passive observers of their lives but rather as individuals who can develop self-awareness from their experiences. Authentic leaders act on that awareness by practicing their values and principles, sometimes at substantial risk to themselves. They are careful to balance their motivations so that they are driven by these inner values as much as by a desire for external rewards or recognition. Authentic lead- ers also keep a strong support team around them, en- suring that they live integrated, grounded lives.

        Learning from your life story

The journey to authentic leadership begins with un- derstanding the story of your life. Your life story pro- vides the context for your experiences, and through it, you can ﬁnd the inspiration to make an impact

                            8

Discovering Your Authentic Leadership

in the world. As the novelist John Barth once wrote, "The story of your life is not your life. It is your story." In other words, it is your personal narrative that mat- ters, not the mere facts of your life. Your life narrative is like a permanent recording playing in your head. Over and over, you replay the events and personal in- teractions that are important to your life, attempting to make sense of them to ﬁnd your place in the world. While the life stories of authentic leaders cover the full spectrum of experiences---including the posi- tive impact of parents, athletic coaches, teachers, and mentors---many leaders reported that their motiva- tion came from a difﬁcult experience in their lives. They described the transformative effects of the loss of a job; personal illness; the untimely death of a close friend or relative; and feelings of being ex- cluded, discriminated against, and rejected by peers. Rather than seeing themselves as victims, though, authentic leaders used these formative experiences to give meaning to their lives. They reframed these

                              9

Authentic Leadership

events to rise above their challenges and to discover their passion to lead. Let's focus now on one leader in particular, No- vartis chairman and CEO Daniel Vasella, whose life story was one of the most difﬁcult of all the people we interviewed. He emerged from extreme challenges in his youth to reach the pinnacle of the global phar- maceutical industry, a trajectory that illustrates the trials many leaders have to go through on their jour- neys to authentic leadership. Vasella was born in 1953 to a modest family in Fri- bourg, Switzerland. His early years were ﬁlled with medical problems that stoked his passion to become a physician. His ﬁrst recollections were of a hospi- tal where he was admitted at age four when he suf- fered from food poisoning. Falling ill with asthma at age ﬁve, he was sent alone to the mountains of eastern Switzerland for two summers. He found the four-month separations from his parents especially difﬁcult because his caretaker had an alcohol prob- lem and was unresponsive to his needs.

                           10

Discovering Your Authentic Leadership

At age eight, Vasella had tuberculosis, followed by meningitis, and was sent to a sanatorium for a year. Lonely and homesick, he suffered a great deal that year, as his parents rarely visited him. He still re- members the pain and fear when the nurses held him down during the lumbar punctures so that he would not move. One day, a new physician arrived and took time to explain each step of the procedure. Vasella asked the doctor if he could hold a nurse's hand rather than being held down. "The amazing thing is that this time the procedure didn't hurt," Vasella recalls. "Afterward, the doctor asked me, 'How was that?' I reached up and gave him a big hug. These hu- man gestures of forgiveness, caring, and compassion made a deep impression on me and on the kind of person I wanted to become." Throughout his early years, Vasella's life continued to be unsettled. When he was 10, his 18-year-old sis- ter passed away after suffering from cancer for two years. Three years later, his father died in surgery. To support the family, his mother went to work in a

                            11

distant town and came home only once every three weeks. Left to himself, he and his friends held beer parties and got into frequent ﬁghts. This lasted for three years until he met his ﬁrst girlfriend, whose af- fection changed his life. At 20, Vasella entered medical school, later gradu- ating with honors. During medical school, he sought out psychotherapy so he could come to terms with his early experiences and not feel like a victim. Through analysis, he reframed his life story and realized that he wanted to help a wider range of people than he could as an individual practitioner. Upon completion of his residency, he applied to become chief physician at the University of Zurich; however, the search com- mittee considered him too young for the position. Disappointed but not surprised, Vasella decided to use his abilities to increase his impact on medi- cine. At that time, he had a growing fascination with ﬁnance and business. He talked with the head of the pharmaceutical division of Sandoz, who of-

                            12

Discovering Your Authentic Leadership

fered him the opportunity to join the company's US afﬁliate. In his ﬁve years in the United States, Vasella ﬂourished in the stimulating environment, ﬁrst as a sales representative and later as a product manager, and advanced rapidly through the Sandoz marketing organization. When Sandoz merged with Ciba-Geigy in 1996, Vasella was named CEO of the combined companies, now called Novartis, despite his young age and lim- ited experience. Once in the CEO's role, Vasella blos- somed as a leader. He envisioned the opportunity to build a great global health care company that could help people through lifesaving new drugs, such as Gleevec, which has proved to be highly effective for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Drawing on the physician role models of his youth, he built an entirely new Novartis culture centered on compas- sion, competence, and competition. These moves established Novartis as a giant in the industry and Vasella as a compassionate leader.

                             13

Authentic Leadership

Vasella's experience is just one of dozens provided by authentic leaders who traced their inspiration di- rectly from their life stories. Asked what empowered them to lead, these leaders consistently replied that they found their strength through transformative ex- periences. Those experiences enabled them to under- stand the deeper purpose of their leadership.

        Knowing your authentic self

When the 75 members of Stanford Graduate School of Business's Advisory Council were asked to rec- ommend the most important capability for lead- ers to develop, their answer was nearly unanimous: self-awareness. Yet many leaders, especially those early in their careers, are trying so hard to establish themselves in the world that they leave little time for self-exploration. They strive to achieve success in tangible ways that are recognized in the external

                          14

Discovering Your Authentic Leadership

world---money, fame, power, status, or a rising stock price. Often their drive enables them to be profes- sionally successful for a while, but they are unable to sustain that success. As they age, they may ﬁnd something is missing in their lives and realize they are holding back from being the person they want to be. Knowing their authentic selves requires the cour- age and honesty to open up and examine their experi- ences. As they do so, leaders become more humane and willing to be vulnerable. Of all the leaders we interviewed, David Pottruck, former CEO of Charles Schwab, had one of the most persistent journeys to self-awareness. An all-league football player in high school, Pottruck became MVP of his college team at the University of Pennsylvania. After completing his MBA at Wharton and a stint with Citigroup, he joined Charles Schwab as head of marketing, moving from New York to San Fran- cisco. An extremely hard worker, Pottruck could not understand why his new colleagues resented the long

                             15

Authentic Leadership

hours he put in and his aggressiveness in pushing for results. "I thought my accomplishments would speak for themselves," he said. "It never occurred to me that my level of energy would intimidate and offend other people, because in my mind I was trying to help the company." Pottruck was shocked when his boss told him, "Dave, your colleagues do not trust you." As he re- called, "That feedback was like a dagger to my heart. I was in denial, as I didn't see myself as others saw me. I became a lightning rod for friction, but I had no idea how self-serving I looked to other people. Still, somewhere in my inner core the feedback resonated as true." Pottruck realized that he could not succeed unless he identiﬁed and overcame his blind spots. Denial can be the greatest hurdle that leaders face in becoming self-aware. They all have egos that need to be stroked, insecurities that need to be smoothed, fears that need to be allayed. Authentic leaders real- ize that they have to be willing to listen to feedback--- especially the kind they don't want to hear. It was

                          16

Discovering Your Authentic Leadership

only after his second divorce that Pottruck ﬁnally was able to acknowledge that he still had large blind spots: "After my second marriage fell apart, I thought I had a wife-selection problem." Then he worked with a counselor who delivered some hard truths: "The good news is you do not have a wife-selection prob- lem; the bad news is you have a husband-behavior problem." Pottruck then made a determined effort to change. As he described it, "I was like a guy who has had three heart attacks and ﬁnally realizes he has to quit smoking and lose some weight." These days Pottruck is happily remarried and lis- tens carefully when his wife offers constructive feed- back. He acknowledges that he falls back on his old habits at times, particularly in high-stress situa- tions, but now he has developed ways of coping with stress. "I have had enough success in life to have that foundation of self-respect, so I can take the criti- cism and not deny it. I have ﬁnally learned to toler- ate my failures and disappointments and not beat myself up."

                               17

Authentic Leadership

Practicing your values and principles

The values that form the basis for authentic leader- ship are derived from your beliefs and convictions, but you will not know what your true values are until they are tested under pressure. It is relatively easy to list your values and to live by them when things are going well. When your success, your career, or even your life hangs in the balance, you learn what is most important, what you are prepared to sacriﬁce, and what trade-offs you are willing to make. Leadership principles are values translated into ac- tion. Having a solid base of values and testing them un- der ﬁre enables you to develop the principles you will use in leading. For example, a value such as "concern for others" might be translated into a leadership prin- ciple such as "create a work environment where peo- ple are respected for their contributions, provided job security, and allowed to fulﬁll their potential."

                           18

Discovering Your Authentic Leadership

Consider Jon Huntsman, the founder and chair- man of Huntsman Corporation. His moral values were deeply challenged when he worked for the Nixon administration in 1972, shortly before Water- gate. After a brief stint in the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), he took a job under H. R. Haldeman, President Nixon's power- ful chief of staff. Huntsman said he found the experi- ence of taking orders from Haldeman "very mixed. I wasn't geared to take orders, irrespective of whether they were ethically or morally right." He explained, "We had a few clashes, as plenty of things that Hal- deman wanted to do were questionable. An amoral atmosphere permeated the White House." One day, Haldeman directed Huntsman to help him entrap a California congressman who had been opposing a White House initiative. The congress- man was part owner of a plant that reportedly employed undocumented workers. To gather infor- mation to embarrass the congressman, Haldeman

                             19

Authentic Leadership

told Huntsman to get the plant manager of a com- pany Huntsman owned to place some undocumented workers at the congressman's plant in an undercover operation. "There are times when we react too quickly and fail to realize immediately what is right and wrong," Huntsman recalled. "This was one of those times when I didn't think it through. I knew instinctively it was wrong, but it took a few minutes for the notion to percolate. After 15 minutes, my inner moral com- pass made itself noticed and enabled me to recognize this wasn't the right thing to do. Values that had ac- companied me since childhood kicked in. Halfway through my conversation with our plant manager, I said to him, 'Let's not do this. I don't want to play this game. Forget that I called.'" Huntsman told Haldeman that he would not use his employees in this way. "Here I was saying no to the second most powerful person in the country. He didn't appreciate responses like that, as he viewed

YOUR DEVELOPMENT AS AN AUTHENTIC LEADER

As you read this article, think about the basis for your leadership development and the path you need to fol- low to become an authentic leader. Then ask yourself these questions: 1. Which people and experiences in your early life had the greatest impact on you? 2. What tools do you use to become self-aware? What is your authentic self? What are the moments when you say to yourself, "This is the real me"? 3. What are your most deeply held values? Where did they come from? Have your values changed signiﬁcantly since your childhood? How do your values inform your actions? 4. What motivates you extrinsically? What are your intrinsic motivations? How do you balance extrinsic and intrinsic motivation in your life? (Continued)

them as signs of disloyalty. I might as well have been saying farewell. So be it. I left within the next six months."

        Balancing your extrinsic and
            intrinsic motivations

Because authentic leaders need to sustain high lev- els of motivation and keep their lives in balance, it is critically important for them to understand what drives them. There are two types of motivations---ex- trinsic and intrinsic. Although they are reluctant to admit it, many leaders are propelled to achieve by measuring their success against the outside world's parameters. They enjoy the recognition and status that come with promotions and ﬁnancial rewards. Intrinsic motivations, on the other hand, are derived from their sense of the meaning of their life. They are closely linked to one's life story and the way one

                             23

Authentic Leadership

frames it. Examples include personal growth, help- ing other people develop, taking on social causes, and making a difference in the world. The key is to ﬁnd a balance between your desires for external validation and the intrinsic motivations that provide fulﬁllment in your work. Many interviewees advised aspiring leaders to be wary of getting caught up in social, peer, or paren- tal expectations. Debra Dunn, who has worked in Silicon Valley for decades as a Hewlett-Packard ex- ecutive, acknowledged the constant pressures from external sources: "The path of accumulating material possessions is clearly laid out. You know how to mea- sure it. If you don't pursue that path, people wonder what is wrong with you. The only way to avoid getting caught up in materialism is to understand where you ﬁnd happiness and fulﬁllment." Moving away from the external validation of per- sonal achievement is not always easy. Achievement- oriented leaders grow so accustomed to successive

                          24

Discovering Your Authentic Leadership

accomplishments throughout their early years that it takes courage to pursue their intrinsic motivations. But at some point, most leaders recognize that they need to address more difﬁcult questions in order to pursue truly meaningful success. McKinsey's Alice Woodwark, who at 29 has already achieved notable success, reﬂected: "My version of achievement was pretty naive, born of things I learned early in life about praise and being valued. But if you're just chas- ing the rabbit around the course, you're not running toward anything meaningful." Intrinsic motivations are congruent with your values and are more fulﬁlling than extrinsic moti- vations. John Thain, CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, said, "I am motivated by doing a really good job at whatever I am doing, but I prefer to mul- tiply my impact on society through a group of peo- ple." Or as Ann Moore, chairman and CEO of Time, put it, "I came here 25 years ago solely because I loved magazines and the publishing world." Moore

                             25

Authentic Leadership

had a dozen job offers after business school but took the lowest-paying one with Time because of her pas- sion for publishing.

         Building your support team

Leaders cannot succeed on their own; even the most outwardly conﬁdent executives need support and advice. Without strong relationships to provide per- spective, it is very easy to lose your way. Authentic leaders build extraordinary support teams to help them stay on course. Those teams counsel them in times of uncertainty, help them in times of difﬁculty, and celebrate with them in times of success. After their hardest days, leaders ﬁnd com- fort in being with people on whom they can rely so they can be open and vulnerable. During the low points, they cherish the friends who appreciate them for who they are, not what they are. Authentic lead-

                           26

ers ﬁnd that their support teams provide afﬁrmation, advice, perspective, and calls for course corrections when needed. How do you go about building your support team? Most authentic leaders have a multifaceted sup- port structure that includes their spouses or signif- icant others, families, mentors, close friends, and colleagues. They build their networks over time, as the experiences, shared histories, and openness with people close to them create the trust and conﬁdence they need in times of trial and uncertainty. Leaders must give as much to their supporters as they get from them so that mutually beneﬁcial relationships can develop. It starts with having at least one person in your life with whom you can be completely yourself, warts and all, and still be accepted unconditionally. Often that person is the only one who can tell you the honest truth. Most leaders have their closest relationships with their spouses, although some develop these

                             27

Authentic Leadership

bonds with another family member, a close friend, or a trusted mentor. When leaders can rely on uncondi- tional support, they are more likely to accept them- selves for who they really are. Many relationships grow over time through an expression of shared values and a common purpose. Randy Komisar of venture capital ﬁrm Kleiner Per- kins Cauﬁeld & Byers said his marriage to Hewlett- Packard's Debra Dunn is lasting because it is rooted in similar values. "Debra and I are very independent but extremely harmonious in terms of our personal aspirations, values, and principles. We have a strong resonance around questions like, 'What is your leg- acy in this world?' It is important to be in sync about what we do with our lives." Many leaders have had a mentor who changed their lives. The best mentoring interactions spark mutual learning, exploration of similar values, and shared enjoyment. If people are only looking for a leg up from their mentors, instead of being interested in

                           28

Discovering Your Authentic Leadership

their mentors' lives as well, the relationships will not last for long. It is the two-way nature of the connec- tion that sustains it. Personal and professional support groups can take many forms. Piper Jaffray's Tad Piper is a member of an Alcoholics Anonymous group. He noted, "These are not CEOs. They are just a group of nice, hard- working people who are trying to stay sober, lead good lives, and work with each other about being open, honest, and vulnerable. We reinforce each other's behavior by talking about our chemical de- pendency in a disciplined way as we go through the 12 steps. I feel blessed to be surrounded by people who are thinking about those kinds of issues and ac- tually doing something, not just talking about them." Bill George's experiences echo Piper's: In 1974, he joined a men's group that formed after a weekend retreat. More than 30 years later, the group is still meeting every Wednesday morning. After an open- ing period of catching up on each other's lives and

                              29

Authentic Leadership

dealing with any particular difﬁculty someone may be facing, one of the group's eight members leads a discussion on a topic he has selected. These discus- sions are open, probing, and often profound. The key to their success is that people say what they really be- lieve without fear of judgment, criticism, or reprisal. All the members consider the group to be one of the most important aspects of their lives, enabling them to clarify their beliefs, values, and understanding of vital issues, as well as serving as a source of honest feedback when they need it most.

Integrating your life by staying grounded

Integrating their lives is one of the greatest challenges leaders face. To lead a balanced life, you need to bring together all of its constituent elements---work, family, community, and friends---so that you can be the same person in each environment. Think of your life as a

                           30

Discovering Your Authentic Leadership

house, with a bedroom for your personal life, a study for your professional life, a family room for your fam- ily, and a living room to share with your friends. Can you knock down the walls between these rooms and be the same person in each of them? As John Donahoe, president of eBay Market- places and former worldwide managing director of Bain, stressed, being authentic means maintaining a sense of self no matter where you are. He warned, "The world can shape you if you let it. To have a sense of yourself as you live, you must make conscious choices. Sometimes the choices are really hard, and you make a lot of mistakes." Authentic leaders have a steady and conﬁdent presence. They do not show up as one person one day and another person the next. Integration takes discipline, particularly during stressful times when it is easy to become reactive and slip back into bad habits. Donahoe feels strongly that integrating his life has enabled him to become a more effective

                             31

Authentic Leadership

leader. "There is no nirvana," he said. "The struggle is constant, as the trade-offs don't get any easier as you get older." But for authentic leaders, personal and professional lives are not a zero-sum game. As Dona- hoe said, "I have no doubt today that my children have made me a far more effective leader in the work- place. Having a strong personal life has made the dif- ference." Leading is high-stress work. There is no way to avoid stress when you are responsible for people, organizations, outcomes, and managing the constant uncertainties of the environment. The higher you go, the greater your freedom to control your destiny but also the higher the degree of stress. The question is not whether you can avoid stress but how you can control it to maintain your own sense of equilibrium. Authentic leaders are constantly aware of the im- portance of staying grounded. Besides spending time with their families and close friends, authentic lead- ers get physical exercise, engage in spiritual practices, do community service, and return to the places where

                           32

Discovering Your Authentic Leadership

they grew up. All are essential to their effectiveness as leaders, enabling them to sustain their authenticity.

         Empowering people to lead

Now that we have discussed the process of discov- ering your authentic leadership, let's look at how authentic leaders empower people in their organiza- tions to achieve superior long-term results, which is the bottom line for all leaders. Authentic leaders recognize that leadership is not about their success or about getting loyal subordi- nates to follow them. They know the key to a suc- cessful organization is having empowered leaders at all levels, including those who have no direct reports. They not only inspire those around them, they em- power those individuals to step up and lead. A reputation for building relationships and em- powering people was instrumental in chairman and

                             33

Authentic Leadership

CEO Anne Mulcahy's stunning turnaround of Xerox. When Mulcahy was asked to take the company's reins from her failed predecessor, Xerox had \$18 billion in debt, and all credit lines were exhausted. With the share price in free fall, morale was at an all-time low. To make matters worse, the SEC was investigating the company's revenue recognition practices. Mulcahy's appointment came as a surprise to everyone---including Mulcahy herself. A Xerox vet- eran, she had worked in ﬁeld sales and on the cor- porate staff for 25 years, but not in ﬁnance, R&D, or manufacturing. How could Mulcahy cope with this crisis when she had had no ﬁnancial experience? She brought to the CEO role the relationships she had built over 25 years, an impeccable understanding of the organization, and, above all, her credibility as an authentic leader. She bled for Xerox, and everyone knew it. Because of that, they were willing to go the extra mile for her. After her appointment, Mulcahy met personally with the company's top 100 executives to ask them if

                              34

Discovering Your Authentic Leadership

they would stay with the company despite the chal- lenges ahead. "I knew there were people who weren't supportive of me," she said. "So I confronted a couple of them and said, 'This is about the company.'" The ﬁrst two people Mulcahy talked with, both of whom ran big operating units, decided to leave, but the remaining 98 committed to stay. Throughout the crisis, people in Xerox were empowered by Mulcahy to step up and lead in order to restore the company to its former greatness. In the end, her leadership enabled Xerox to avoid bankruptcy as she paid back \$10 billion in debt and restored revenue growth and proﬁtability with a combination of cost savings and innovative new products. The stock price tripled as a result.

Like Mulcahy, all leaders have to deliver bottom-line results. By creating a virtuous circle in which the re- sults reinforce the effectiveness of their leadership, authentic leaders are able to sustain those results

                             35

Authentic Leadership

through good times and bad. Their success enables them to attract talented people and align employees' activities with shared goals, as they empower others on their team to lead by taking on greater challenges. Indeed, superior results over a sustained period of time is the ultimate mark of an authentic leader. It may be possible to drive short-term outcomes with- out being authentic, but authentic leadership is the only way we know to create sustainable long-term results. For authentic leaders, there are special rewards. No individual achievement can equal the pleasure of leading a group of people to achieve a worthy goal. When you cross the ﬁnish line together, all the pain and suffering you may have experienced quickly van- ishes. It is replaced by a deep inner satisfaction that you have empowered others and thus made the world a better place. That's the challenge and the fulﬁllment of authentic leadership.

The Authenticity Paradox

    By Herminia Ibarra
           39

A uthenticity has become the gold standard for leadership. But a simplistic understanding of what it means can hinder your growth and limit your impact. Consider Cynthia, a general manager in a health care organization. Her promotion into that role in- creased her direct reports tenfold and expanded the range of businesses she oversaw---and she felt a little shaky about making such a big leap. A strong believer in transparent, collaborative leadership, she bared her soul to her new employees: "I want to do this job," she said, "but it's scary, and I need your help." Her

                          41

Authentic Leadership

candor backﬁred; she lost credibility with people who wanted and needed a conﬁdent leader to take charge. Or take George, a Malaysian executive in an auto parts company where people valued a clear chain of command and made decisions by consensus. When a Dutch multinational with a matrix structure acquired the company, George found himself working with peers who saw decision making as a freewheeling contest for the best-debated ideas. That style didn't come easily to him, and it contradicted everything he had learned about humility growing up in his coun- try. In a 360-degree debrief, his boss told him that he needed to sell his ideas and accomplishments more aggressively. George felt he had to choose between being a failure and being a fake. Because going against our natural inclinations can make us feel like impostors, we tend to latch on to authenticity as an excuse for sticking with what's comfortable. But few jobs allow us to do that for long. That's doubly true when we advance in our careers

                          42

The Authenticity Paradox

or when demands or expectations change, as Cyn- thia, George, and countless other executives have discovered. In my research on leadership transitions, I have observed that career advances require all of us to move way beyond our comfort zones. At the same time, however, they trigger a strong countervailing impulse to protect our identities: When we are un- sure of ourselves or our ability to perform well or measure up in a new setting, we often retreat to fa- miliar behaviors and styles. But my research also demonstrates that the mo- ments that most challenge our sense of self are the ones that can teach us the most about leading effec- tively. By viewing ourselves as works in progress and evolving our professional identities through trial and error, we can develop a personal style that feels right to us and suits our organizations' changing needs. That takes courage, because learning, by deﬁnition, starts with unnatural and often superﬁcial behaviors

                           43

Authentic Leadership

that can make us feel calculating instead of genuine and spontaneous. But the only way to avoid being pigeonholed and ultimately become better leaders is to do the things that a rigidly authentic sense of self would keep us from doing.

Why leaders struggle with authenticity

The word "authentic" traditionally referred to any work of art that is an original, not a copy. When used to describe leadership, of course, it has other mean- ings---and they can be problematic. For example, the notion of adhering to one "true self " ﬂies in the face of much research on how people evolve with experi- ence, discovering facets of themselves they would never have unearthed through introspection alone. And being utterly transparent---disclosing every sin- gle thought and feeling---is both unrealistic and risky. (See ﬁgure 1, "What is authenticity?")

                          44

FIGURE 1

What is authenticity?

A too-rigid deﬁnition of authenticity can get in the way of eﬀective leadership. Here are three examples and the problems they pose.

                     Being true to yourself.
                     Which self? We have many
                     selves, depending on the
                     diﬀerent roles that we play
                     in life. We evolve and even
                     transform ourselves with
                     experience in new roles.
                     How can you be true to
                     a future self that is still
                     uncertain and unformed?
                     Maintaining strict
                     coherence between
                     what you feel and what
                     you say or do.
                     You lose credibility and
                     eﬀectiveness as a leader
                     if you disclose everything
                     you think and feel, especially
                     when you are unproven.

                     Making values-
                     based choices.
                     When we move into bigger
                     roles, values that were shaped
                     by past experiences can lead
                     us astray. For instance,
                     “tight control over operating
                     details” might produce
                     authentic but wrong-headed
                     behavior in the face of new
                     challenges.

Authentic Leadership

Leaders today struggle with authenticity for sev- eral reasons. First, we make more-frequent and more-radical changes in the kinds of work we do. As we strive to improve our game, a clear and ﬁrm sense of self is a compass that helps us navigate choices and progress toward our goals. But when we're looking to change our game, a too-rigid self-concept becomes an anchor that keeps us from sailing forth, as it did at ﬁrst with Cynthia. Second, in global business, many of us work with people who don't share our cultural norms and have different expectations for how we should behave. It can often seem as if we have to choose between what is expected---and therefore effective---and what feels authentic. George is a case in point. Third, identities are always on display in today's world of ubiquitous connectivity and social media. How we present ourselves---not just as executives but as people, with quirks and broader interests---has become an important aspect of leadership. Having to

                             46

The Authenticity Paradox

carefully curate a persona that's out there for all to see can clash with our private sense of self. In dozens of interviews with talented executives facing new expectations, I have found that they most often grapple with authenticity in the following situations.

        Taking charge in an unfamiliar role

As everyone knows, the ﬁrst 90 days are critical in a new leadership role. First impressions form quickly, and they matter. Depending on their personalities, leaders respond very differently to the increased vis- ibility and performance pressure. Psychologist Mark Snyder, of the University of Minnesota, identiﬁed two psychological proﬁles that inform how leaders develop their personal styles. "High self-monitors"---or chameleons, as I call them--- are naturally able and willing to adapt to the demands of a situation without feeling fake. Chameleons care

                            47

Authentic Leadership

about managing their public image and often mask their vulnerability with bluster. They may not always get it right the ﬁrst time, but they keep trying on dif- ferent styles like new clothes until they ﬁnd a good ﬁt for themselves and their circumstances. Because of that ﬂexibility, they often advance rapidly. But cha- meleons can run into problems when people perceive them as disingenuous or lacking a moral center--- even though they're expressing their "true" chame- leon nature. By contrast, "true-to-selfers" (Snyder's "low self- monitors") tend to express what they really think and feel, even when it runs counter to situational de- mands. The danger with true-to-selfers like Cynthia and George is that they may stick too long with com- fortable behavior that prevents them from meeting new requirements, instead of evolving their style as they gain insight and experience. Cynthia (whom I interviewed after her story ap- peared in a Wall Street Journal article by Carol Hymo- witz) hemmed herself in like this. She thought she

                           48

The Authenticity Paradox

was setting herself up for success by staying true to her highly personal, full-disclosure style of manage- ment. She asked her new team for support, openly acknowledging that she felt a bit at sea. As she scram- bled to learn unfamiliar aspects of the business, she worked tirelessly to contribute to every decision and solve every problem. After a few months, she was on the verge of burnout. To make matters worse, shar- ing her vulnerability with her team members so early on had damaged her standing. Reﬂecting on her transition some years later, Cynthia told me: "Being authentic doesn't mean that you can be held up to the light and people can see right through you." But at the time, that was how she saw it---and instead of building trust, she made people question her ability to do the job. Delegating and communicating appropriately are only part of the problem in a case like this. A deeper- seated issue is ﬁnding the right mix of distance and closeness in an unfamiliar situation. Stanford psychologist Deborah Gruenfeld describes this as

                           49

Authentic Leadership

managing the tension between authority and ap- proachability. To be authoritative, you privilege your knowledge, experience, and expertise over the team's, maintaining a measure of distance. To be approach- able, you emphasize your relationships with people, their input, and their perspective, and you lead with empathy and warmth. Getting the balance right pre- sents an acute authenticity crisis for true-to-selfers, who typically have a strong preference for behaving one way or the other. Cynthia made herself too ap- proachable and vulnerable, and it undermined and drained her. In her bigger role, she needed more dis- tance from her employees to gain their conﬁdence and get the job done.

         Selling your ideas (and yourself )

Leadership growth usually involves a shift from hav- ing good ideas to pitching them to diverse stakehold- ers. Inexperienced leaders, especially true-to-selfers,

                          50

The Authenticity Paradox

often ﬁnd the process of getting buy-in distasteful be- cause it feels artiﬁcial and political; they believe that their work should stand on its own merits. Here's an example: Anne, a senior manager at a transportation company, had doubled revenue and fundamentally redesigned core processes in her unit. Despite her obvious accomplishments, however, her boss didn't consider her an inspirational leader. Anne also knew she was not communicating effectively in her role as a board member of the parent company. The chairman, a broad-brush thinker, often became impatient with her detail orientation. His feedback to her was "step up, do the vision thing." But to Anne that seemed like valuing form over substance. "For me, it is manipulation," she told me in an interview. "I can do the storytelling too, but I refuse to play on people's emotions. If the string-pulling is too obvious, I can't make myself do it." Like many aspiring leaders, she resisted crafting emotional messages to inﬂuence and inspire others because that felt less authentic to

                            51

Authentic Leadership

her than relying on facts, ﬁgures, and spreadsheets. As a result, she worked at cross-purposes with the board chairman, pushing hard on the facts instead of pulling him in as a valued ally. Many managers know deep down that their good ideas and strong potential will go unnoticed if they don't do a better job of selling themselves. Still, they can't bring themselves to do it. "I try to build a net- work based on professionalism and what I can de- liver for the business, not who I know," one manager told me. "Maybe that's not smart from a career point of view. But I can't go against my beliefs . . . So I have been more limited in 'networking up.' " Until we see career advancement as a way of ex- tending our reach and increasing our impact in the organization---a collective win, not just a selﬁsh pur- suit---we have trouble feeling authentic when touting our strengths to inﬂuential people. True-to-selfers ﬁnd it particularly hard to sell themselves to senior management when they most need to do so: when

                           52

The Authenticity Paradox

they are still unproven. Research shows, however, that this hesitancy disappears as people gain expe- rience and become more certain of the value they bring.

             Processing negative feedback

Many successful executives encounter serious nega- tive feedback for the ﬁrst time in their careers when they take on larger roles or responsibilities. Even when the criticisms aren't exactly new, they loom larger because the stakes are higher. But leaders of- ten convince themselves that dysfunctional aspects of their "natural" style are the inevitable price of being effective. Let's look at Jacob, a food company production manager whose direct reports gave him low marks in a 360 review on emotional intelligence, team build- ing, and empowering others. One team member wrote that it was hard for Jacob to accept criticism.

                            53

Authentic Leadership

Another remarked that after an angry outburst, he'd suddenly make a joke as if nothing had happened, not realizing the destabilizing effect of his mood changes on those around him. For someone who gen- uinely believed that he'd built trust among his people, all this was tough to swallow. Once the initial shock had subsided, Jacob ac- knowledged that this was not the ﬁrst time he'd received such criticism (some colleagues and sub- ordinates had made similar comments a few years earlier). "I thought I'd changed my approach," he re- ﬂected, "but I haven't really changed so much since the last time." However, he quickly rationalized his behavior to his boss: "Sometimes you have to be tough in order to deliver results, and people don't like it," he said. "You have to accept that as part of the job description." Of course, he was missing the point. Because negative feedback given to leaders often centers on style rather than skills or expertise, it can feel like a threat to their identity---as if they're being

Managers can choose from countless books, articles, and executive workshops for advice on how to be more authentic at work. Two trends help explain the exploding popularity of the concept and the training industry it has fed. (Continued)

          WHY COMPANIES ARE PUSHING
            AUTHENTICITY TRAINING

First, trust in business leaders fell to an all-time low in 2012, according to the Edelman Trust Barom- eter. Even in 2013, when trust began to climb back up, only 18% of people reported that they trusted business leaders to tell the truth, and fewer than half trusted businesses to do the right thing. Second, employee engagement is at a nadir. A 2013 Gallup poll found that only 13% of employ- ees worldwide are engaged at work. Only one in eight workers---out of roughly 180 million employees studied---is psychologically committed to his or her job. In study after study, frustration, burnout, disillu- sionment, and misalignment with personal values are cited among the biggest reasons for career change. At a time when public conﬁdence and employee morale are so low, it's no surprise that companies are encouraging leaders to discover their "true" selves.

                           56

The Authenticity Paradox

asked to give up their "secret sauce." That's how Jacob saw it. Yes, he could be explosive---but from his point of view, his "toughness" allowed him to deliver results year after year. In reality, though, he had succeeded up to this point despite his behavior. When his role expanded and he took on greater responsibility, his intense scrutiny of subordinates became an even big- ger obstacle because it took up time he should have been devoting to more-strategic pursuits. A great public example of this phenomenon is Margaret Thatcher. Those who worked with her knew she could be merciless if someone failed to prepare as thoroughly as she did. She was capable of humiliat- ing a staff member in public, she was a notoriously bad listener, and she believed that compromise was cowardice. As she became known to the world as the "Iron Lady," Thatcher grew more and more con- vinced of the rightness of her ideas and the neces- sity of her coercive methods. She could beat anyone into submission with the power of her rhetoric and

                           57

Authentic Leadership

conviction, and she only got better at it. Eventually, though, it was her undoing---she was ousted by her own cabinet.

           A playful frame of mind

Such a rigid self-concept can result from too much introspection. When we look only within for answers, we inadvertently reinforce old ways of seeing the world and outdated views of ourselves. Without the beneﬁt of what I call outsight---the valuable exter- nal perspective we get from experimenting with new leadership behaviors---habitual patterns of thought and action fence us in. To begin thinking like lead- ers, we must ﬁrst act: plunge ourselves into new proj- ects and activities, interact with very different kinds of people, and experiment with new ways of getting things done. Especially in times of transition and un- certainty, thinking and introspection should follow

                          58

The Authenticity Paradox

experience---not vice versa. Action changes who we are and what we believe is worth doing. Fortunately, there are ways of increasing outsight and evolving toward an "adaptively authentic" way of leading, but they require a playful frame of mind. Think of leadership development as trying on pos- sible selves rather than working on yourself---which, let's face it, sounds like drudgery. When we adopt a playful attitude, we're more open to possibilities. It's OK to be inconsistent from one day to the next. That's not being a fake; it's how we experiment to ﬁg- ure out what's right for the new challenges and cir- cumstances we face. My research suggests three important ways to get started.

           Learn from diverse role models

Most learning necessarily involves some form of imitation---and the understanding that nothing is

                           59

"original." An important part of growing as a leader is viewing authenticity not as an intrinsic state but as the ability to take elements you have learned from others' styles and behaviors and make them your own. But don't copy just one person's leadership style; tap many diverse role models. There is a big differ- ence between imitating someone wholesale and bor- rowing selectively from various people to create your own collage, which you then modify and improve. As the playwright Wilson Mizner said, copying one au- thor is plagiarism, but copying many is research. I observed the importance of this approach in a study of investment bankers and consultants who were advancing from analytical and project work to roles advising clients and selling new business. Though most of them felt incompetent and insecure in their new positions, the chameleons among them consciously borrowed styles and tactics from suc-

                          60

The Authenticity Paradox

cessful senior leaders---learning through emulation how to use humor to break tension in meetings, for instance, and how to shape opinion without being overbearing. Essentially, the chameleons faked it un- til they found what worked for them. Noticing their efforts, their managers provided coaching and men- toring and shared tacit knowledge. As a result, the chameleons arrived much faster at an authentic but more skillful style than the true-to- selfers in the study, who continued to focus solely on demonstrating technical mastery. Often the true-to- selfers concluded that their managers were "all talk and little content" and therefore not suitable role models. In the absence of a "perfect" model they had a harder time with imitation---it felt bogus. Unfor- tunately, their managers perceived their inability to adapt as a lack of effort or investment and thus didn't give them as much mentoring and coaching as they gave the chameleons.

               Work on getting better

Setting goals for learning (not just for performance) helps us experiment with our identities without feel- ing like impostors, because we don't expect to get everything right from the start. We stop trying to protect our comfortable old selves from the threats that change can bring and start exploring what kinds of leaders we might become. Of course, we all want to perform well in a new situation---get the right strategy in place, execute like crazy, deliver results the organization cares about. But focusing exclusively on those things makes us afraid to take risks in the service of learning. In a series of ingenious experiments, Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck has shown that concern about how we will ap- pear to others inhibits learning on new or unfamiliar tasks. Performance goals motivate us to show others that we possess valued attributes, such as intelligence and social skill, and to prove to ourselves that we

                           62

The Authenticity Paradox

               THE CULTURAL FACTOR

Whatever the situation---taking charge in unfamiliar territory, selling your ideas and yourself, or process- ing negative feedback---ﬁnding authentic ways of be- ing eﬀective is even more diﬃcult in a multicultural environment. As my INSEAD colleague Erin Meyer ﬁnds in her re- search, styles of persuading others and the kinds of arguments that people ﬁnd persuasive are far from universal; they are deeply rooted in a culture's philo- sophical, religious, and educational assumptions. That said, prescriptions for how leaders are supposed to look and sound are rarely as diverse as the leaders themselves. And despite corporate initiatives to build understanding of cultural diﬀerences and promote diversity, the fact is that leaders are still expected to express ideas assertively, to claim credit for them, and to use charisma to motivate and inspire people.

              THE CULTURAL FACTOR

Authenticity is supposed to be an antidote to a single model of leadership. (After all, the message is to be yourself, not what someone else expects you to be.) But as the notion has gained currency, it has, ironi- cally, come to mean something much more limiting and culturally speciﬁc. A closer look at how leaders are taught to discover and demonstrate authentic- ity---by telling a personal story about a hardship they have overcome, for example---reveals a model that is, in fact, very American, based on ideals such as self- disclosure, humility, and individualistic triumph over adversity. This amounts to a catch-22 for managers from cultures with diﬀerent norms for authority, commu- nication, and collective endeavor because they must behave inauthentically in order to conform to the strictures of "authentic" leadership.

                          64

The Authenticity Paradox

have them. By contrast, learning goals motivate us to develop valued attributes. When we're in performance mode, leadership is about presenting ourselves in the most favorable light. In learning mode, we can reconcile our yearning for authenticity in how we work and lead with an equally powerful desire to grow. One leader I met was highly effective in small-group settings but struggled to con- vey openness to new ideas in larger meetings, where he often stuck to long-winded presentations for fear of getting derailed by others' comments. He set him- self a "no PowerPoint" rule to develop a more relaxed, improvisational style. He surprised himself by how much he learned, not only about his own evolving preferences but also about the issues at hand.

             Don’t stick to “your story”

Most of us have personal narratives about deﬁning moments that taught us important lessons. Con-

                           65

Authentic Leadership

sciously or not, we allow our stories, and the images of ourselves that they paint, to guide us in new situ- ations. But the stories can become outdated as we grow, so sometimes it's necessary to alter them dra- matically or even to throw them out and start from scratch. That was true for Maria, a leader who saw her- self as a "mother hen with her chicks all around." Her coach, former Ogilvy & Mather CEO Charlotte Beers, explains in I'd Rather Be in Charge that this self-image emerged from a time when Maria had to sacriﬁce her own goals and dreams to take care of her extended family. It eventually began to hold her back in her career: Though it had worked for her as a friendly and loyal team player and a peacekeeper, it wasn't helping her get the big leadership assignment she wanted. Together Maria and her coach looked for another deﬁning moment to use as a touchstone--- one that was more in keeping with Maria's desired future self, not who she had been in the past. They

                          66

The Authenticity Paradox

chose the time when Maria, as a young woman, had left her family to travel the world for 18 months. Acting from that bolder sense of self, she asked for---and got---a promotion that had previously been elusive. Dan McAdams, a Northwestern psychology pro- fessor who has spent his career studying life stories, describes identity as "the internalized and evolving story that results from a person's selective appropria- tion of past, present, and future." This isn't just aca- demic jargon. McAdams is saying that you have to believe your story---but also embrace how it changes over time, according to what you need it to do. Try out new stories about yourself, and keep editing them, much as you would your résumé. Again, revising one's story is both an introspective and a social process. The narratives we choose should not only sum up our experiences and aspirations but also reﬂect the demands we face and resonate with the audience we're trying to win over.

                            67

Authentic Leadership

Countless books and advisers tell you to start your leadership journey with a clear sense of who you are. But that can be a recipe for staying stuck in the past. Your leadership identity can and should change each time you move on to bigger and better things. The only way we grow as leaders is by stretching the limits of who we are---doing new things that make us uncomfortable but that teach us through direct experience who we want to become. Such growth doesn't require a radical personality make- over. Small changes---in the way we carry ourselves, the way we communicate, the way we interact---often make a world of difference in how effectively we lead.

What Bosses Gain by Being Vulnerable

By Emma Seppala

         71

O ne morning in Bangalore, South India, Ar- chana Patchirajan, founder of a technology startup, called her entire staff in for a meet- ing. When everyone was seated, she announced that she had to let them go because the startup had run out of funds. She could no longer pay them. Shock- ingly, her staff of high-caliber engineers who had their pick of jobs in the booming Silicon Valley of India, refused to go. They said they would rather work for half their pay than leave her. They stayed and kept working so hard that, a few years later, Patchirajan's company---Hubbl, which provides in- ternet advertising solutions---sold for \$14 million.

                         73

Authentic Leadership

Patchirajan continues to work on startups from the United States, and her staff, though thousands of miles away from her, continues to work for her. What explains the connection and devotion that Patchirajan's staff had toward her? Patchirajan's story is particularly extraordinary when you consider the alarming fact that according to a Gallup study, 70% of employees are "not engaged" or are "actively disengaged" at work.1 As a conse- quence, they are "less emotionally connected" and also "less likely to be productive." What is it about Patchi- rajan that not only prevented this phenomenon in her staff but actually ﬂipped it? When I asked one of Patchirajan's longest- standing employees what drove him and the rest of the team to stay with her, these are some of the things he shared: "We all work as a family because she treats us as such." "She knows everyone in the of- ﬁce and has a personal relationship with each one of us." "She does not get upset when we make mistakes

                           74

What Bosses Gain by Being Vulnerable

but gives us the time to learn how to analyze and ﬁx the situation." If you look at these comments, they suggest that Patchirajan's relationship with her employees runs deeper than that of the usual employer-employee re- lationship. Simply put, she is vulnerable and authen- tic with them. She shared her doubts honestly when the company was going downhill, she does not ad- here to a strict hierarchy but treats her employees like family members, and she has a personal relationship with each one of them. Sound touchy-feely, daunting, or counterintuitive? Here's why it's not. Brené Brown, an expert on social connection, conducted thousands of interviews to discover what lies at the root of social connections. A thorough analysis of the data revealed what it was: vulnerabil- ity. Vulnerability here does not mean being weak or submissive. To the contrary, it implies the courage to be oneself. It means replacing "professional dis- tance and cool" with uncertainty, risk, and emotional

                             75

Authentic Leadership

exposure. Opportunities for vulnerability present themselves to us at work every day. Some examples Patchirajan gives of vulnerability include calling an employee or colleague whose child is not well, reach- ing out to someone who has just had a loss in their family, asking someone for help, taking responsibility for something that went wrong at work, or sitting by the bedside of a colleague or employee with a termi- nal illness. More important, Brown describes vulnerability and authenticity as being at the root of human con- nection. And human connection is often dramati- cally absent from workplaces. Johann Berlin, CEO of Transformational Leadership for Excellence (TLEX), recounts an experience he had while teaching a work- shop at a Fortune 100 company. The participants were all higher-level management. After an exercise in which pairs of participants shared an event from their life with each other, one of the top executive managers approached Berlin. Visibly moved by the

                          76

What Bosses Gain by Being Vulnerable

experience, he said "I've worked with my colleague for more than 25 years and have never known about the difﬁcult times in his life." In a short moment of authentic connection, this manager's understanding and connection with his colleague deepened in ways that hadn't happened in decades of working together. Why is human connection missing at work? As leaders and employees, we are often taught to keep a distance and project a certain image---one of con- ﬁdence, competence, and authority. We may disclose our vulnerability to a spouse or close friend behind closed doors at night, but we would never show it elsewhere during the day, let alone at work. However, data suggests that we may want to re- visit the idea of projecting an image. Research shows that people subconsciously register a lack of au- thenticity in others. Just by looking at someone, we download large amounts of information. "We are programmed to observe each other's states so we can more appropriately interact, empathize, or assert our

                            77

Authentic Leadership

boundaries---whatever the situation may require," says Paula Niedenthal, professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin--Madison. We are wired to read each others' expressions in a very nuanced way. This process is called "resonance," and it is so automatic and rapid that it often happens below our awareness. Like an acute sounding board, parts of our brain internally echo what others do and feel. Just by look- ing at someone, you experience them: You internally resonate with them. Ever seen someone trip and momentarily felt a twinge of pain for them? Observ- ing them activates the "pain matrix" in your brain, research shows.2 Ever been moved by the sight of a person helping someone? You vicariously experi- enced it and thereby felt elevation. Someone's smile activates the smile muscles in our face, while a frown activates our frown muscles, according to research by Ulf Dimberg at Uppsala University in Sweden.3 We internally register what another person is feeling. As

                          78

What Bosses Gain by Being Vulnerable

a consequence, if a smile is fake, we are more likely to feel uncomfortable than comfortable. While we may try to appear perfect, strong, or intelligent to be respected by others, pretense often has the opposite effect intended. Paula Niedenthal's research shows that we resonate too deeply with one another to ignore inauthenticity.4 Just think of how uncomfortable you feel around someone you per- ceive as "taking on airs" or "putting on a show." We tend to see right through them and feel less con- nected. Or think of how you respond when you know someone is upset, but they're trying to conceal it. "What's wrong?" you ask, only to be told, "Nothing!" Rarely does this answer satisfy---because we sense it's not true. Our brains are wired to read cues so subtle that even when we don't consciously register the cues, our bodies respond. For example, when someone is an- gry but keeps their feelings bottled up, we may not realize that they are angry (they don't look angry) but

                            79

Authentic Leadership

still our blood pressure will increase, according to re- search by James Gross at Stanford University.5 Why do we feel more comfortable around some- one who is authentic and vulnerable? Because we are particularly sensitive to signs of trustworthiness in our leaders.6 Servant leadership, for example, which is characterized by authenticity and values-based leadership, yields more positive and constructive behavior in employees and greater feelings of hope and trust in both the leader and the organization.7 In turn, trust in a leader improves employee perfor- mance.8 You can even see this at the level of the brain. Employees who recall a boss who resonated with them show enhanced activation in parts of the brain related to positive emotion and social connection.9 The reverse is true when they think of a boss who did not resonate. One example of authenticity and vulnerability is forgiveness. Forgiveness doesn't mean tolerance of error but rather a patient encouragement of growth.

                           80

What Bosses Gain by Being Vulnerable

Forgiveness is what Archana Patchirajan's employee described as, "She does not get upset when we make mistakes but gives us the time to learn how to analyze and ﬁx the situation." Forgiveness may be another soft-sounding term but, as University of Michigan researcher Kim Cameron points out in the book Posi- tive Organizational Behavior, it has hard results: A culture of forgiveness in organizations can lead to increased employee productivity as well as less vol- untary turnover.10 Again, a culture that is forgiving breeds trust. As a consequence, an organization be- comes more resilient in times of organizational stress or downsizing. Why do we fear vulnerability or think it's inappro- priate for the workplace? For one, we are afraid that if someone ﬁnds out who we really are or discovers a soft or vulnerable spot, they will take advantage of us. However, as I describe in my hbr.org article, "The Hard Data on Being a Nice Boss," kindness goes fur- ther than the old sink-or-swim paradigm.

                            81

Authentic Leadership

Here's what may happen if you embrace an au- thentic and vulnerable stance: Your staff will see you as a human being; they may feel closer to you, they may be prompted to share advice, and---if you are attached to hierarchy---you may ﬁnd that your team begins to feel more horizontal. While these types of changes might feel uncomfortable, you may see, as in Patchirajan's case, that the beneﬁts are worth it. There are additional beneﬁts you may reap from a closer connection to employees, too. One study out of Stanford shows that CEOs are looking for more advice and counsel but that two thirds of them don't get it.11 This isolation can skew perspectives and lead to potentially disadvantageous leadership choices. Who better to receive advice from than your own em- ployees, who are intimately familiar with your prod- uct, your customers, and problems that might exist within the organization? Rather than feeling like another peg in the system, your team members will feel respected and honored

                           82

What Bosses Gain by Being Vulnerable

for their opinions and will consequently become more loyal. The research shows that the personal connection and happiness employees derive from their work fosters greater loyalty than the amount on their paycheck.12

Practice Tough Empathy

By Rob Goﬀee and Gareth Jones

              87

T here's altogether too much hype nowadays about the idea that leaders must show con- cern for their teams. There's nothing worse than seeing a manager return from the latest inter- personal-skills training program with "concern" for others. Real leaders don't need a training program to convince their employees that they care. Real leaders empathize ﬁercely with the people they lead. They also care intensely about the work their employees do. Consider Alain Levy, the former CEO of Polygram. Although he often comes across as a rather aloof in- tellectual, Levy is well able to close the distance be- tween himself and his followers. On one occasion,

                          89

Authentic Leadership

he helped some junior record executives in Australia choose singles off albums. Picking singles is a criti- cal task in the music business: The selection of a song can make or break the album. Levy sat down with the young people and took on the work with passion. "You bloody idiots," he added his voice to the melee, "you don't know what the hell you're talking about; we always have a dance track ﬁrst!" Within 24 hours, the story spread throughout the company; it was the best PR Levy ever got. "Levy really knows how to pick singles," people said. In fact, he knew how to identify with the work, and he knew how to enter his follow- ers' world---one where strong, colorful language is the norm---to show them that he cared. Clearly, as the above example illustrates, we do not believe that the empathy of inspirational leaders is the soft kind described in so much of the manage- ment literature. On the contrary, we feel that real leaders manage through a unique approach we call tough empathy. Tough empathy means giving people

                          90

Practice Tough Empathy

what they need, not what they want. Organizations like the Marine Corps and consulting ﬁrms specialize in tough empathy. Recruits are pushed to be the best that they can be; "grow or go" is the motto. Chris Sat- terwaite, the CEO of Bell Pottinger Communications and a former chief executive of several ad agencies, understands what tough empathy is all about. He adeptly handles the challenges of managing creative people while making tough decisions. "If I have to, I can be ruthless," he says. "But while they're with me, I promise my people that they'll learn." At its best, tough empathy balances respect for the individual and for the task at hand. Attending to both, however, isn't easy, especially when the busi- ness is in survival mode. At such times, caring leaders have to give selﬂessly to the people around them and know when to pull back. Consider a situation at Uni- lever at a time when it was developing Persil Power, a detergent that eventually had to be removed from the market because it destroyed clothes that were

                           91

Authentic Leadership

laundered in it. Even though the product was show- ing early signs of trouble, CEO Niall FitzGerald stood by his troops. "That was the popular place to be, but I should not have been there," he says now. "I should have stood back, cool and detached, looked at the whole ﬁeld, watched out for the customer." But caring with detachment is not easy, especially since, when done right, tough empathy is harder on you than on your employees. "Some theories of leadership make caring look effortless. It isn't," says Paulanne Man- cuso, president and CEO of Calvin Klein Cosmet- ics. "You have to do things you don't want to do, and that's hard." It's tough to be tough. Tough empathy also has the beneﬁt of impelling leaders to take risks. When Greg Dyke took over at the BBC, his commercial competitors were able to spend substantially more on programs than the BBC could. Dyke quickly realized that in order to thrive in a digital world, the BBC needed to increase its ex-

                           92

Practice Tough Empathy

penditures. He explained this openly and directly to the staff. Once he had secured their buy-in, he began thoroughly restructuring the organization. Although many employees were let go, he was able to maintain people's commitment. Dyke attributed his success to his tough empathy with employees: "Once you have the people with you, you can make the difﬁcult deci- sions that need to be made." One ﬁnal point about tough empathy: Those more apt to use it are people who really care about some- thing. And when people care deeply about some- thing---anything---they're more likely to show their true selves. They will not only communicate authen- ticity, which is the precondition for leadership, but they will show that they are doing more than just play- ing a role. People do not commit to executives who merely live up to the obligations of their jobs. They want more. They want someone who cares passion- ately about the people and the work---just as they do.

Cracking the Code That Stalls People of Color

    By Sylvia Ann Hewlett
             95

I t's a topic that corporations once routinely ignored, then dismissed, and are only now beginning to dis- cuss: the dearth of professionals of color in senior positions. Professionals of color hold only 11% of ex- ecutive posts in corporate America.1 Among Fortune 500 CEOs, only six are black, eight are Asian, and eight are Hispanic.2 Performance and hard work, along with spon- sors, get top talent recognized and promoted, but leadership potential isn't enough to lever men and women into the executive suite. Top jobs are given to those who also look and act the part, who manifest

                          97

Authentic Leadership

"executive presence" (EP). According to research by the Center for Talent Innovation (CTI), EP consti- tutes 26% of what senior leaders say it takes to get the next promotion.3 Yet because senior leaders are over- whelmingly Caucasian, professionals of color (Afri- can American, Asian, and Hispanic individuals) ﬁnd themselves at an immediate disadvantage in trying to look, sound, and act like a leader. And the feedback that might help them do so is markedly absent at all levels of management. Executive presence rests on three pillars: gravitas (the core characteristic, according to 67% of the 268 senior executives surveyed), an amalgam of behav- iors that convey conﬁdence, inspire trust, and bolster credibility; communication skills (according to 28%); and appearance, the ﬁlter through which commu- nication skills and gravitas become more apparent. While they are aware of the importance of EP, men and women of color are nonetheless hard-pressed to

                           98

Cracking the Code That Stalls People of Color

interpret and embody aspects of a code written by and for white men. Research from CTI ﬁnds that professionals of color, like their Caucasian counterparts, prioritize gravitas over communication and communication over appearance. Yet, "cracking the code" of executive presence presents unique challenges for professionals of color because standards of appropriate behavior, speech, and attire demand they suppress or sacriﬁce aspects of their cultural identity in order to conform. They overwhelmingly feel that EP at their ﬁrm is based on white male standards---African Americans, especially, were 97% more likely than their Caucasian counterparts to agree with this assessment---and that conforming to these standards requires altering their authenticity, a new version of "bleached-out profes- sionalism" that contributes to feelings of resentment and disengagement. (See ﬁgures 2 and 3.) People of color already feel they have to work harder than their

Executive presence further eludes professionals of color because they're not likely to get feedback on their "presentation of self." Qualitative ﬁndings af- ﬁrm that their superiors, most of whom are white, hesitate to call attention to gravitas shortfalls or com- munication blunders for fear of coming across as

                                       101

racially insensitive or discriminatory. While sponsors might close this gap by speciﬁcally addressing EP is- sues with their high potentials, CTI's 2012 research shows that professionals of color are much less likely to have a sponsor than Caucasians (8% versus 13%).4 When they do get feedback, they're unclear about how to act on it, particularly if they were born out- side the United States. (See ﬁgure 4.) This is a serious problem for corporations that need local expertise to expand their inﬂuence in global markets. In short, because feedback is either absent, overly vague, or contradictory, executive presence remains an inscrutable set of rules for professionals of color--- rules they're judged by but cannot interpret and em- body except at considerable cost to their authenticity. Consequently, in a workplace where unconscious bias continues to permeate the corridors of power and leadership is mostly white and male, professionals of color are measurably disadvantaged in their efforts to be perceived as leaders.

Research from CTI shows, however, that their insights need a key ingredient to reach full-scale implementation: a cadre of equally diverse leaders.5 Yet the power of difference is missing at the top, just when it matters most.

For a Corporate Apology to Work, the CEO Should Look Sad

By Sarah Green Carmichael

S traight up, we made some mistakes," Whole Foods co-CEOs John Mackey and Walter Robb said in a video apology in response to an over- charging scandal. "We weren't prepared for the crisis, and we dropped the ball," wrote Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky on the Airbnb blog in 2011, after a guest trashed a host's home. "This should never have happened. It is simply unacceptable," said Mary Barra, CEO of GM, in one of several public apologies in the wake of safety scan- dals at the automaker.

                         109

The corporate apology, once a relative rarity, has become a normal part of business discourse. Stuff happens, and then we say we're sorry for it. But just because corporate apologies have become common- place doesn't mean they're all created equal. Two new studies shed light on what makes some apologies effective and what makes others backﬁre. First, Leanne ten Brinke of the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business and Gabrielle S. Adams of the London Business School examine how expressions of emotion affect corporate apologies. Publishing in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, they present the ﬁndings of two studies.1 In the ﬁrst study, they looked at how investors re- acted to real apologies from executives. They exam- ined 29 online videos of apologies made between 2007 and 2011. Using an established system for dis- tinguishing facial expressions (the Facial Action Cod- ing System, or FACS), their researchers watched each

                          110

For a Corporate Apology to Work, the CEO Should Look Sad

video second by second, without sound, and tracked the expressions that ﬂitted across the executives' faces. Were they frowning? Smiling? Looking sad? Then Brinke and Adams looked at what happened to the company's stock price after the apology. They found that for those leaders who had apologized with a smile, the stock price dropped---perhaps because the leader seemed insincere delivering his apology, or even seemed to be enjoying the suffering his com- pany had caused. The more the person smiled, the worse his company performed. For the leaders who appeared genuinely contrite, at ﬁrst it seemed like there was no impact on stock price: The company neither performed worse nor performed better. "Normative emotions simply allow the company to move forward," they write. But then the researchers took a closer look at CEO apologies, speciﬁcally---16 out of the 29 cases. They found that when an apology was delivered by a CEO who looked sad, the company's stock price actually

                            111

Authentic Leadership

rose post-apology. They determined that "a good apology can build investor conﬁdence," especially in the long term. To investigate this further, Brinke and Adams con- ducted an experiment in which they hired an actor to portray an airline CEO apologizing for a computer malfunction that canceled 140 ﬂights, stranding thousands of passengers---a scenario based on a real Alaska Airlines snafu. They made sure his ﬁctional apology contained all the verbal elements of a good apology: the components previous research has iden- tiﬁed as being central to repairing relationships, in- cluding an explicit "I'm sorry," an offer of repair, an explanation, taking responsibility, and a promise of forbearance. They then recruited subjects to watch this ﬁctional CEO apologize---either happily, sadly, or neutrally. When the CEO appeared sad, partic- ipants rated him as more sincere and were more likely to want to reconcile with him. When the CEO

                          112

For a Corporate Apology to Work, the CEO Should Look Sad

delivered his apology with a smile on his face---or, in- terestingly, a neutral expression---the study partici- pants were less likely to trust him, and the apology even seemed to exacerbate their negative feelings. Even seasoned leaders are likely to ﬁnd delivering an apology to be an uncomfortable experience, and when we feel uncomfortable, a normal reaction is to grimace, laugh awkwardly, or even try to break the tension with a joke. Leaders (especially Americans) may also feel they can't show too much sadness or an- guish but instead must present a positive front at all times. The research by Brinke and Adams reminds us how these understandable impulses can backﬁre. Another paper that appeared in the Journal of Corporate Finance adds an interesting wrinkle to this subject.2 Researchers Don Chance, James Cicon, and Stephen P. Ferris examined 150 press releases from 1993 to 2009 to examine how companies fared when they blamed themselves for poor performance as

                             113

Authentic Leadership

opposed to blaming external factors. They found that while companies are twice as likely to blame exter- nal factors when things go wrong, passing the buck results in continued ﬁnancial decline. Conversely, companies that take responsibility for their missed earnings stabilize and eventually see an uptick in ﬁ- nancial performance. (Interestingly, both groups were about equally likely to ﬁre their CEOs.) Why? After eliminating numerous factors, the researchers conclude that being honest and speciﬁc about the source of the problem---both characteris- tics of self-blaming statements---not only cheers up investors, it likely helps the company turn around the issue more quickly. Conversely, the companies that blamed external factors were often vague (blaming "economic forces" for instance) and seen as less hon- est (since many of their wounds had actually been self-inﬂicted). The message is loud and clear: When you mess up, admit it. And look appropriately sad about it.

    Are Leaders
    Getting Too
    Emotional?

An interview with Gautam Mukunda and Gianpiero Petriglieri by Adi Ignatius and Sarah Green Carmichael

                  117

T here's a lot of crying and shouting both in politics and at the ofﬁce. Gautam Mukunda of Harvard Business School and Gianpiero Petri- glieri of INSEAD help us try to make sense of it all.

Sarah Green Carmichael: It seems today, with lead- ers being in public more, there is an emphasis on our leaders always being authentic---that's the buzzword. And tears and shouting do seem to exude authentic- ity. Gianpiero, what do you make of that? Are our leaders crying and shouting to prove to us that they are real in some way?

                         119

Authentic Leadership

Gianpiero Petriglieri: I don't think people care about leaders being authentic. I think people care about leaders being consistent. Emotions are a great way to convey that you mean what you're saying. I think we also need to make a distinction be- tween people in positions of power, where emo- tional expression is always problematic because you expect a certain contained demeanor---although norms are changing, as Gautam has said---and leaders, where emotions are the whole thing. Emo- tions constitute the connection between people whom we follow and ourselves. So just because you happen to be in a position of visible power, that doesn't mean people regard you as a leader. In fact, demonstrating emotion is a way of claiming, "Hey, I'm here. I think you should pay attention to this. And I am credibly voicing a con- cern that we should all care about." Emotions are a way in which people in power try to lead.

                       120

Are Leaders Getting Too Emotional?

Adi Ignatius: Gianpiero, let me follow up on that because you said that people don't care about their leaders being authentic, and that's basically chal- lenging an entire industry---a sub-industry in the management business that says leaders do need to be authentic. Talk about that a little bit, particularly in the context of emotions. You almost sounded Machia- vellian in what you were saying, that a leader can be whatever---they can be emotional---but the point is to be consistent and therefore effective. Can you talk more about that?

GP: Now when you talk about authenticity, you're talking about two different things. One is spon- taneity, which is to say, "I voice my feelings of the moment." Now that might---or much more likely might not---be appropriate for you as a leader. Then, another part of authenticity means, "I voice credibly, consistently, and authentically the feelings that other people are also feeling. I am

                           121

Authentic Leadership

showing that we are, in a way, sharing the same concern. I am, in many ways, concerned and I care about the same things that you care about." This is what you see leaders doing all the time. Sometimes in a Machiavellian way. But sometimes in a very genuine way. In fact, one of the very rea- sons why we end up following someone is because they seem to be genuinely concerned about things we care about. In politics you see it a lot. You see in political campaigns one candidate saying, "I am one of you guys. I am like you. I have your same background. I care about the same things. But this other guy, he or she is really out for themselves." And the other person is saying the same thing: "No, no, no. I'm actually talking about what we all care about. And this other person is out for themselves." Whoever manages to deﬁne themselves as one of us and deﬁne the opponent as personally inter- ested wins. So what I'm saying is we don't particu- larly care that our leader is expressing something

                       122

Are Leaders Getting Too Emotional?

that's authentic to them. What we really care about is that our leader is expressing emotions that are meaningful to us. This is why emotional expression is a double- edged sword. Because sometimes people interpret an emotion as essentially an act of selﬁshness--- that the emotion is really an expression of you be- ing more preoccupied with yourself than with me. But sometimes people interpret an emotion as an act of generosity: This really shows that you were feeling what I am also feeling. Remember Bill Clinton? In '92 there was a moment during his ﬁrst campaign where he said in a rally, "I feel your pain." And that remained a legendary mo- ment in his ﬁrst election. Because he was doing what leaders always try to do, not always manipu- latively or in a way that's Machiavellian, but often very genuinely to convey that the leader shares not just the same understanding of our situation but the same experience of our situation. This is what most of us have always wanted in the people that

                        123

Authentic Leadership

we then trust to lead, not just that they intellectu- ally understand our circumstances, but that they feel what it's like to be in our circumstances---that they feel our pain, they feel our concerns, they as- pire to our same aspirations, they desire our same desires. That's ultimately what we care about when we say we want leaders to be authentic. We want them to have a lived understanding of our predicament. We don't just want them to express what happens to be true to them at that particular moment.

AI: Gautam, do you agree with that? Because that seems to be a statement that empathy and emotional intelligence are really the key to leadership. I'm sim- plifying, but does that all make sense to you?

Gautam Mukunda: I think empathy and emo- tional intelligence are extraordinarily powerful keys to leadership. You do often hear people

                          124

Are Leaders Getting Too Emotional?

saying---if you look at the Trump phenomenon here in the United States, for example---that they want leaders to tell them what they really think, as opposed to just telling them what the leader thinks they want to hear in order to gain power. But of course it's worth noting that the same people who say this then support those who tell them what they want to hear, not in fact what they really think. So there is some level of doublethink, where, "Donald Trump says what I think, so that must be what he really thinks." It's that ability to tell people what they want to hear in a way that they believe that you're being sincere that strikes me as being a pretty effective tool in getting power. And certainly, what I got from Gianpiero's comment is the extent to which we want our leaders to be not just self-interested but interested in the welfare of the group, of the people they lead, as much as themselves. And that, essentially, many of these contests for power

                        125

Authentic Leadership

involve people struggling to deﬁne their opponents as only being self-interested. I think that's true across almost any organiza- tion. A leader who is self-interested is one whose followers will be much less likely to lead. But to me, then, you get this question: What are emotions? Even a very skilled actor, for example, ﬁnds it difﬁcult to fake tears on cue. That's something that even professional actors can struggle with. So when President Obama cries over children who are murdered in a school, there is a sense that he's revealing some deeply held emotion. It is also striking, of course, that so much of the conservative response to that statement was to suggest that he had onions or something under the podium that were allowing him to fake it, both because I think the people saying this real- ize how powerful it was to see a president break down in tears and because it reveals something

                        126

Are Leaders Getting Too Emotional?

about themselves---that they felt that the murder of many innocent children was somehow some- thing that wouldn't move a person to tears.

GP: You see, I don't think people just want to hear leaders tell them what they think. I think people want to see leaders show them what they them- selves feel. They want to see their leaders express the feeling that they also sense to be true. Of course, not everyone shares the same feel- ings. The example Gautam brings up---President Obama crying---it's an extremely powerful mes- sage. And it humanizes a leader. For people who share the same dismay, the same discomfort, that humanization actually enhances his leadership. And for people who oppose his understanding of the situation, for people who don't share his sen- timents, that humanization diminishes his leader- ship. This is where emotional expression is always

                         127

Authentic Leadership

a double-edged sword. Because the people who share the sentiments you are expressing will actu- ally feel closer to you and, therefore, feel that you are more of a leader. And the people who don't share those sentiments will suddenly feel more distant from you, and they will suspect that you are being manipulative, Machiavellian, and whatnot. In that moment, you have a man who occupies one of the most powerful positions of leadership in the world facing, on his watch, a tragedy. A tragedy that, despite all his power, he cannot reverse. He is therefore expressing frustration at the limitation of that power---a frustration that's not just his own but is also expressed on behalf of a large group of people who probably feel that it is a tragedy that could easily have been prevented with political will, with political action. And it isn't prevented simply because there is not enough political will to implement the changes that you would need for gun control.

                        128

Are Leaders Getting Too Emotional?

SGC: In that moment, President Obama crying--- would that moment have been different if he were a female president? Is there something different about when you see a man break down that way and a fe- male leader of that stature break down that way?

GM: I mean, surely, without a doubt. The criticism that someone is too emotional is one of the clas- sic gendered tropes that are used to go after fe- male leaders. It's worth noting that when Hillary Clinton cried a little bit in 2008 in New Hamp- shire it was highlighted as one of the high points of her campaign. This was one of the moments that turned it around and put her back into the race against Obama in 2008. But it's illustrative that one of the criticisms of Hillary is that she's robotic. Right? So that was a breakthrough of that facade. I think for most women leaders it's a much riskier proposition to cry than for a male leader to

                           129

Authentic Leadership

do so. It just plays into gendered stereotypes that opponents of that leader can use to weaken them very rapidly.

SGC: We should also probably mention here that there may be racial stereotypes. There may be other emotions, like maybe anger, that Obama might get in trouble for expressing that Hillary would not.

GM: Without a doubt. On those few occasions when Barack Obama has revealed how he thinks about the way he presents himself---and it's clear that he is someone who thinks deeply about this kind of thing and is very self-reﬂective on these is- sues---he has said that, above all else, the thing that he most strives to avoid is being perceived as the angry black man. That's the phrase that he used. And that this is a profound force that is shaping how he wants to be seen.

                          130

Are Leaders Getting Too Emotional?

     He essentially feels that visible expressions of

anger are, because of racial dynamics in the United States, almost entirely off limits to him as a leader. And in fact, if you note, before he was reelected, an- ger was in fact entirely off limits to him as a leader. I can't think of any time that he expressed anger in those ﬁrst four years. What we've started to see after he was reelected, and particularly in the past year, is that he essentially has more freedom to ex- press these emotions. And he is taking advantage of it quite powerfully on some occasions.

AI: So given what you said, would you advise female executives to hold their emotions in check? That it may not be fair, but society will still hold it against them if they cry in public in front of their teams?

GM: First, I would advise any leader, male or fe- male, to work pretty hard to do that. The power of

                           131

Authentic Leadership

these moments is at least in part precisely because they are rare. John Boehner's tendency to break down in tears became a punch line in Washington. I don't think it was an asset to his leadership. When Barack Obama did it, it was striking because we had never seen a president do something like that, that I can recall. So male or female, I would say, if you are ex- traordinarily emotional at all times, that is likely to be a handicap for you as a leader at least to some extent. I would tell female executives that it is deeply unfair, but they are being judged more harshly. And they surely know that better than I ever could; I've never spoken with a woman leader who wasn't well aware of that fact and who hadn't thought through the fact that they were being judged by standards that their male counterparts were not.

                         132

Are Leaders Getting Too Emotional?

     But it is too easy to use gendered attacks—to

argue that someone is overly emotional and not thinking things through---against a female leader, or any female leader in a contentious situation where there are people trying to undercut her, to not be extremely cautious of that concern.

SGC: Gianpiero, do you have anything to add either about the anger issue or the weeping issue?

GP: I generally think outrage is a lot easier to fake than sadness. And perhaps a lot easier to mistrust, frankly. See, I think we risk spending too much tension under the stereotypes about what you should or shouldn't do. I would tend to agree that, especially for a se- nior or a visible leader in politics or business, it's a good rule of thumb to have a relatively contained demeanor. I also think that anyone who wants to really be a leader---not just call themselves one---

                           133

Authentic Leadership

has to have some kind of relationship with their emotional life. They ought to be able to ask them- selves not just, "Do I express emotions or not?" but to be a little bit more sophisticated with them- selves and with others to ask, "How do I express emotions?" If you are attentive to the undercurrent of or- ganizational lives, emotions are constantly being expressed. When I work with senior management teams, my ﬁrst question is never, "Do you openly express emotions or not?" My ﬁrst question is, "How do you tend to express emotions?" So, for example, one classic way to scream your divergence with a group's opinion is simply not to show up. Or to show up late to a meeting and say nothing when everyone else is very animated. That's a very overt, very visible expression of dis- appointment or even aggression. Now, whether that's discussed, whether that's decoded, whether

                       134

Are Leaders Getting Too Emotional?

that's verbalized is a different thing. Just because we aren't verbalizing our emotions or melting into tears doesn't mean we aren't expressing strong emotions or that we aren't expressing emotions appropriately. Too detached of an emotional re- sponse can very often be extremely inappropriate and extremely ineffective. So I think, as a leader, the more important questions are: Do you know what you're feeling? And do you know whose feelings those are? Do you know why you're feeling that way? Are you interpreting those feelings just as an expression of your emotional state of the moment? Or are you able to think more deeply about what those feelings are telling you about what's happening around you---what's happening to the people that you're responsible for? And can you make sense of and then articulate them in a way that is useful, in a way that actually advances the task?

What Is Empathy?

    By Daniel Goleman
           1

T he word "attention" comes from the Latin at- tendere, meaning "to reach toward." This is a perfect deﬁnition of focus on others, which is the foundation of empathy and of an ability to build social relationships---the second and third pillars of emotional intelligence (the ﬁrst is self-awareness). Executives who can effectively focus on others are easy to recognize. They are the ones who ﬁnd com- mon ground, whose opinions carry the most weight, and with whom other people want to work. They emerge as natural leaders regardless of organiza- tional or social rank.

                          3

Empathy

               The Empathy Triad

We talk about empathy most commonly as a single attribute. But a close look at where leaders are focus- ing when they exhibit it reveals three distinct kinds of empathy, each important for leadership effectiveness:

• Cognitive empathy: the ability to understand another person's perspective

• Emotional empathy: the ability to feel what someone else feels

• Empathic concern: the ability to sense what another person needs from you

Cognitive empathy enables leaders to explain them- selves in meaningful ways---a skill essential to get- ting the best performance from their direct reports. Contrary to what you might expect, exercising cogni- tive empathy requires leaders to think about feelings rather than to feel them directly.

                           4

What Is Empathy?

An inquisitive nature feeds cognitive empathy. As one successful executive with this trait puts it, "I've always just wanted to learn everything, to understand anybody that I was around---why they thought what they did, why they did what they did, what worked for them and what didn't work." But cognitive empa- thy is also an outgrowth of self-awareness. The ex- ecutive circuits that allow us to think about our own thoughts and to monitor the feelings that ﬂow from them let us apply the same reasoning to other peo- ple's minds when we choose to direct our attention that way. Emotional empathy is important for effective men- toring, managing clients, and reading group dynam- ics. It springs from ancient parts of the brain beneath the cortex---the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, and the orbitofrontal cortex---that al- low us to feel fast without thinking deeply. They tune us in by arousing in our bodies the emotional states of others: I literally feel your pain. My brain pat- terns match up with yours when I listen to you tell

                           5

Empathy

a gripping story. As Tania Singer, the director of the social neuroscience department at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, in Leipzig, Germany, says, "You need to understand your own feelings to understand the feelings of oth- ers." Accessing your capacity for emotional empathy depends on combining two kinds of attention: a de- liberate focus on your own echoes of someone else's feelings and an open awareness of that person's face, voice, and other external signs of emotion. (See the sidebar "When Empathy Needs to Be Learned.")

      WHEN EMPATHY NEEDS TO BE LEARNED

Emotional empathy can be developed. That's the con- clusion suggested by research conducted with physi- cians by Helen Riess, the director of the Empathy and Relational Science Program at Boston's Massachu- setts General Hospital. To help the physicians monitor (Continued)

                           6

What Is Empathy?

themselves, Riess set up a program in which they learned to focus using deep, diaphragmatic breathing and to cultivate a certain detachment---to watch an in- teraction from the ceiling, as it were, rather than being lost in their own thoughts and feelings. "Suspending your own involvement to observe what's going on gives you a mindful awareness of the interaction without be- ing completely reactive," says Riess. "You can see if your own physiology is charged up or balanced. You can notice what's transpiring in the situation." If a doc- tor realizes that she's feeling irritated, for instance, that may be a signal that the patient is bothered too. Those who are utterly at a loss may be able to prime emotional empathy essentially by faking it until they make it, Riess adds. If you act in a caring way--- looking people in the eye and paying attention to their expressions, even when you don't particularly want to---you may start to feel more engaged.

                            7

Empathy

Empathic concern, which is closely related to emo- tional empathy, enables you to sense not just how people feel but what they need from you. It's what you want in your doctor, your spouse---and your boss. Empathic concern has its roots in the circuitry that compels parents' attention to their children. Watch where people's eyes go when someone brings an adorable baby into a room, and you'll see this mam- malian brain center leaping into action. Research suggests that as people rise through the ranks, their ability to maintain personal connections suffers. One neural theory holds that the response is trig- gered in the amygdala by the brain's radar for sensing danger and in the prefrontal cortex by the release of oxytocin, the chemical for caring. This implies that empathic concern is a double-edged feeling. We intu- itively experience the distress of another as our own. But in deciding whether we will meet that person's needs, we deliberately weigh how much we value his or her well-being.

                          8

What Is Empathy?

Getting this intuition-deliberation mix right has great implications. Those whose sympathetic feel- ings become too strong may themselves suffer. In the helping professions, this can lead to compassion fatigue; in executives, it can create distracting feel- ings of anxiety about people and circumstances that are beyond anyone's control. But those who protect themselves by deadening their feelings may lose touch with empathy. Empathic concern requires us to manage our personal distress without numbing our- selves to the pain of others. (See the sidebar "When Empathy Needs to Be Controlled.")

WHEN EMPATHY NEEDS TO BE CONTROLLED

Getting a grip on our impulse to empathize with other people's feelings can help us make better decisions when someone's emotional ﬂood threatens to over- whelm us. Ordinarily, when we see someone pricked with a pin, our brains emit a signal indicating that our own pain centers are echoing that distress. But physicians learn in medical school to block even such automatic responses. Their attentional anesthetic seems to be deployed by the temporal-parietal junction and re- gions of the prefrontal cortex, a circuit that boosts concentration by tuning out emotions. That's what is happening in your brain when you distance yourself from others in order to stay calm and help them. The same neural network kicks in when we see a problem in an emotionally overheated environment and need to focus on looking for a solution. If you're talking with

                           10

What Is Empathy?

someone who is upset, this system helps you under- stand the person's perspective intellectually by shift- ing from the heart-to-heart of emotional empathy to the head-to-heart of cognitive empathy. What's more, some lab research suggests that the appropriate application of empathic concern is criti- cal to making moral judgments. Brain scans have re- vealed that when volunteers listened to tales of peo- ple being subjected to physical pain, their own brain centers for experiencing such pain lit up instantly. But if the story was about psychological suﬀering, the higher brain centers involved in empathic concern and compassion took longer to activate. Some time is needed to grasp the psychological and moral dimen- sions of a situation. The more distracted we are, the less we can cultivate the subtler forms of empathy and compassion.

Why Compassion Is a Better Managerial Tactic Than Toughness

     By Emma Seppala
           13

S tanford University neurosurgeon James Doty tells the story of performing surgery on a little boy's brain tumor. In the middle of the proce- dure, the resident who is assisting him gets distracted and accidentally pierces a vein. With blood shedding everywhere, Doty is no longer able to see the delicate brain area he is working on. The boy's life is at stake. Doty is left with no other choice than to blindly reach into the affected area in the hopes of locating and clamping the vein. Fortunately, he is successful. Most of us are not brain surgeons, but we certainly are all confronted with situations in which an em- ployee makes a grave mistake, potentially ruining a

                          15

Empathy

critical project. The question is: How should we react when an employee is not performing well or makes a mistake? Frustration is of course the natural response---and one we all can identify with. Especially if the mistake hurts an important project or reﬂects badly on us. The traditional approach is to reprimand the em- ployee in some way. The hope is that some form of punishment will be beneﬁcial: It will teach the em- ployee a lesson. Expressing our frustration also may relieve us of the stress and anger caused by the mis- take. Finally, it may help the rest of the team stay on their toes to avoid making future errors. Some managers, however, choose a different re- sponse when confronted by an underperforming employee: compassion and curiosity. Not that a part of them isn't frustrated or exasperated---maybe they still worry about how their employee's mistakes will reﬂect back on them---but they are somehow able to suspend judgment and may even be able to use the moment to do a bit of coaching.

                          16

Why Compassion Is a Better Managerial Tactic Than Toughness

What does research say is best? The more compas- sionate response will get you more powerful results. First, compassion and curiosity increase employee loyalty and trust. Research has shown that feelings of warmth and positive relationships at work have a greater say over an employee's loyalty than the size of his or her paycheck.1 In particular, a study by Jonathan Haidt of New York University shows that the more employees look up to their leaders and are moved by their compassion or kindness (a state he terms "elevation"), the more loyal they become to him or her.2 So if you are more compassionate to your em- ployee, not only will he or she be more loyal to you, but anyone else who has witnessed your behavior may also experience elevation and feel more devoted to you. Conversely, responding with anger or frustration erodes loyalty. As Adam Grant, professor at the Wharton Business School and author of Give and Take, points out that, because of the law of reci- procity, if you embarrass or blame an employee too

                              17

Empathy

harshly, your reaction may end up coming around to haunt you. "Next time you need to rely on that em- ployee, you may have lost some of the loyalty that was there before," he told me. We are especially sensitive to signs of trustworthi- ness in our leaders, and compassion increases our willingness to trust.3 Simply put, our brains respond more positively to bosses who have shown us empa- thy, as neuroimaging research conﬁrms.4 Employee trust in turn improves performance.5 Doty, who is also director of Stanford University's Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education, recalls his ﬁrst experience in the operat- ing room. He was so nervous that he perspired pro- fusely. Soon enough, a drop of sweat fell into the op- eration site and contaminated it. The operation was a simple one, and the patients' life was in no way at stake. As for the operation site, it could have been easily irrigated. However, the operating surgeon--- one of the biggest names in surgery at the time---was

                             18

Why Compassion Is a Better Managerial Tactic Than Toughness

so angry that he kicked Doty out of the OR. Doty re- calls returning home and crying tears of devastation. Tellingly, Doty explains in an interview how, if the surgeon had acted differently, he would have gained Doty's undying loyalty. "If the surgeon, instead of raging, had said something like: 'Listen young man, look what just happened---you contaminated the ﬁeld. I know you're nervous. You can't be nervous if you want to be a surgeon. Why don't you go outside and take a few minutes to collect yourself. Readjust your cap in such a way that the sweat doesn't pour down your face. Then come back and I'll show you something.' Well, then he would have been my hero forever." Not only does an angry response erode loyalty and trust, it also inhibits creativity by jacking up the em- ployee's stress level. As Doty explains, "Creating an environment where there is fear, anxiety, and lack of trust makes people shut down. If people have fear and anxiety, we know from neuroscience that their

                               19

Empathy

threat response is engaged, and their cognitive con- trol is impacted. As a consequence, their productivity and creativity diminish." For instance, brain-imaging studies show that when we feel safe, our brain's stress response is lower.6 Grant also agrees that "when you respond in a frustrated, furious manner, the employee becomes less likely to take risks in the future because he or she worries about the negative consequences of making mistakes. In other words, you kill the culture of ex- perimentation that is critical to learning and inno- vation." Grant refers to research by Fiona Lee at the University of Michigan that shows that promoting a culture of safety---rather than of fear of negative con- sequences---helps encourage the spirit of experimen- tation that is so critical for creativity.7 There is, of course, a reason we feel anger. Re- search shows that feelings of anger can have beneﬁcial results. For example, they can give us the energy to stand up against injustice.8 Moreover, they make us appear more powerful.9 However,

                             20

Why Compassion Is a Better Managerial Tactic Than Toughness

when as a leader you express negative emotions like anger, your employees actually view you as less ef- fective.10 Conversely, being likable and projecting warmth---not toughness---gives leaders a distinct ad- vantage, as Amy Cuddy of Harvard Business School has shown.11 So how can you respond with more compassion the next time an employee makes a serious mistake?

1.  Take a moment. Doty explains that the ﬁrst thing to do is to get a handle on your own emotions--- anger, frustration, or whatever the case may be. "You have to take a step back and control your own emotional response, because if you act out of emo- tional engagement, you are not thoughtful about your approach to the problem. By stepping back and taking a period of time to reﬂect, you enter a mental state that allows for a more thoughtful, reasonable, and discerned response." Practicing meditation can help improve your self-awareness and emotional control.12

                               21

     Empathy

You don't want to operate from a place where you are just pretending not to be angry. Research shows that this kind of pretense actually ends up raising heart rates for both you and your employee.13 Instead, take some time to cool off so you can see the situation with more detachment.

2.  Put yourself in your employee's shoes. Taking a step back will help give you the ability to empathize with your employee. Why was Doty, in the near-tragic moment in the operating room, able to respond pro- ductively rather than with anger? As a consequence of recalling his own ﬁrst experience in the OR, he could identify and empathize with the resident. This allowed him to curb his frustration, avoid degrad- ing the already horriﬁed resident, and maintain the presence of mind to save a little boy's life. The ability to perspective-take is a valuable one. Studies have shown that it helps you see aspects of the situation you may not have noticed and leads to better results in interactions and negotiations.14 And

                            22

     Why Compassion Is a Better Managerial Tactic Than Toughness

because positions of power tend to lower our natural inclination for empathy, it is particularly important that managers have the self-awareness to make sure they practice seeing situations from their employee's perspective.15

3.  Forgive. Empathy, of course, helps you forgive. Forgiveness not only strengthens your relationship with your employee by promoting loyalty, it turns out that it is also good for you. Whereas carrying a grudge is bad for your heart (blood pressure and heart rate both go up), forgiveness lowers both your blood pressure and that of the person you're forgiv- ing.16 Other studies show that forgiveness makes you happier and more satisﬁed with life, signiﬁcantly re- ducing stress and negative emotions.17 When trust, loyalty, and creativity are high and stress is low, employees are happier and more pro- ductive, and turnover is lower.18 Positive interactions even make employees healthier and require fewer sick days.19 Other studies have shown how compassionate

                               23

     Empathy

management leads to improvements in customer ser- vice and client outcomes and satisfaction.20 Doty told me he's never thrown anyone out of his OR. "It's not that I let them off the hook, but by choosing a compassionate response when they know they have made a mistake, they are not destroyed, they have learned a lesson, and they want to improve for you because you've been kind to them."

What Great Listeners Actually Do

By Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman

               29

C hances are you think you're a good listener. People's appraisal of their listening ability is much like their assessment of their driving skills, in that the great bulk of adults think they're above average. In our experience, most people think good listen- ing comes down to doing three things:

• Not talking when others are speaking

• Letting others know you're listening through facial expressions and verbal sounds ("Mm-hmm")

                         31

Empathy

• Being able to repeat what others have said, practically word for word

In fact, much management advice on listening suggests that people should do these very things--- encouraging listeners to remain quiet, nod and "mm- hmm" encouragingly, and then repeat back to the talker something like, "So, let me make sure I un- derstand. What you're saying is . . ." However, recent research that we've conducted suggests that these behaviors fall far short of describing good listening skills. We analyzed data that describes the behavior of 3,492 participants in a development program de- signed to help managers become better coaches. As part of this program, participants' coaching skills were evaluated through 360-degree assessments. We identiﬁed the individuals who were perceived as being the most effective listeners (the top 5%). We then compared the best listeners with the aver- age of all other people in the data set and identiﬁed

                         32

What Great Listeners Actually Do

the 20 characteristics that seemed to set them apart. With those results in hand we identiﬁed the factors that differed between great and average listeners and analyzed the data to determine which characteristics their colleagues identiﬁed as the behaviors that made them outstanding listeners. We found some surprising characteristics, along with some qualities we expected to hear. We grouped them into four main ﬁndings:

• Good listening is much more than being silent while the other person talks. To the contrary, people perceive the best listeners to be those who periodically ask questions that promote discovery and insight. These questions gen- tly challenge old assumptions but do so in a constructive way. Sitting there silently nodding does not provide sure evidence that a person is listening, but asking a good question tells the speaker the listener has not only heard what was said but that they comprehended it well

                            33

Empathy

enough to want additional information. Good listening was consistently seen as a two-way dialogue, rather than a one-way "speaker versus hearer" interaction. The best conversations were active.

• Good listening includes interactions that build up a person's self-esteem. The best listeners make the conversation a positive experience for the other party, which doesn't happen when the listener is passive (or critical, for that matter). Good listeners make the other person feel sup- ported and convey conﬁdence in the speaker. Good listening is characterized by the creation of a safe environment in which issues and dif- ferences can be discussed openly.

• Good listening is seen as a cooperative conver- sation. In the interactions we studied, feedback ﬂowed smoothly in both directions with neither party becoming defensive about comments

                        34

What Great Listeners Actually Do

the other made. By contrast, poor listeners were seen as competitive---as listening only to identify errors in reasoning or logic, using their silence as a chance to prepare their next response. That might make you an excellent debater, but it doesn't make you a good listener. Good listeners may challenge assumptions and disagree, but the person being listened to feels the listener is trying to help rather than trying to win an argument.

• Good listeners tend to make suggestions. In the study, good listening invariably included some feedback that was provided in a way oth- ers would accept and that opened up alterna- tive paths to consider. This ﬁnding somewhat surprised us, since it's not uncommon to hear complaints that "So-and-so didn't listen, he just jumped in and tried to solve the problem." Per- haps what the data is telling us is that making

                         35

Empathy

     suggestions is not itself the problem; it may be
     more about the skill with which those sugges-
     tions are made. Another possibility is that we’re
     more likely to accept suggestions from people
     we already think are good listeners. (Someone
     who is silent for the whole conversation and
     then jumps in with a suggestion may not be
     seen as credible. Someone who seems combat-
     ive or critical and then tries to give advice may
     not be seen as trustworthy.)

While many of us may think of being a good lis- tener like being a sponge that accurately absorbs what the other person is saying, what these ﬁndings show is that instead, good listeners are like trampo- lines: You can bounce ideas off of them, and rather than absorbing your ideas and energy, they amplify, energize, and clarify your thinking. They make you feel better not by merely passively absorbing, but by actively supporting. This lets you gain energy and height, just like a trampoline.

                          36

What Great Listeners Actually Do

Of course, there are different levels of listening. Not every conversation requires the highest levels of listening, but many conversations would beneﬁt from greater focus and listening skill. Consider which level of listening you'd like to aim for.

       Level 1: The listener creates a safe environ-
       ment in which difﬁcult, complex, or emotional
       issues can be discussed.

       Level 2: The listener clears away distractions
       like phones and laptops, focusing attention on
       the other person and making appropriate eye
       contact. (This behavior not only affects how
       you are perceived as the listener; it immedi-
       ately inﬂuences the listener’s own attitudes
       and inner feelings. Acting the part changes
       how you feel inside. This in turn makes you a
       better listener.)

       Level 3: The listener seeks to understand the
       substance of what the other person is saying.

                             37

Empathy

They capture ideas, ask questions, and restate issues to conﬁrm that their understanding is correct.

Level 4: The listener observes nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions, perspiration, res- piration rates, gestures, posture, and numer- ous other subtle body language signals. It is estimated that 80% of what we communicate comes from these signals. It sounds strange to some, but you listen with your eyes as well as your ears.

Level 5: The listener increasingly understands the other person's emotions and feelings about the topic at hand and identiﬁes and acknowl- edges them. The listener empathizes with and validates those feelings in a supportive, nonjudgmental way.

Level 6: The listener asks questions that clar- ify assumptions the other person holds and

                   38

What Great Listeners Actually Do

      helps the other person see the issue in a new
      light. This could include the listener injecting
      some thoughts and ideas about the topic that
      could be useful to the other person. However,
      good listeners never highjack the conversation
      so that they or their issues become the subject
      of the discussion.

Each of the levels builds on the others; thus, if you've been criticized for offering solutions rather than listening, it may mean you need to attend to some of the other levels (such as clearing away dis- tractions or empathizing) before your proffered sug- gestions can be appreciated. We suspect that in being a good listener, most of us are more likely to stop short rather than go too far. Our hope is that this research will help by providing a new perspective on listening. We hope those who labor under an illusion of superiority about their lis- tening skills will see where they really stand. We also hope the common perception that good listening is

                            39

Empathy

mainly about acting like an absorbent sponge will wane. Finally, we hope all will see that the highest and best form of listening comes in playing the same role for the other person that a trampoline would play for a child: It gives energy, acceleration, height, and ampliﬁcation. These are the hallmarks of great listening.

Empathy Is Key to a Great Meeting

     By Annie McKee
           41

Y es, we all hate meetings. Yes, they are usually a waste of time. And yes, they're here to stay. So it's your responsibility as a leader to make them better. This doesn't mean just making them shorter, more efﬁcient, and more organized. People need to enjoy them and, dare I say it, have fun. Happiness matters a lot at work. How could it not, when many of us spend most of our waking hours there. The alternatives---chronic frustration, discon- tent, and outright hatred of our jobs---are simply not acceptable. Negative feelings interfere with creativ- ity and innovation, not to mention collaboration.1 And let's face it: Meetings are, for the most part, still where lots of collaboration, creativity, and innovation

                           43

Empathy

happen.2 If meetings aren't working, then chances are we're not able to do what we need to do. So how do we ﬁx meetings so they are more enjoy- able and produce more positive feelings? Sure, invite the right people, create better agendas, and be better prepared. Those are baseline ﬁxes. But if you really want to improve how people work together at meet- ings, you'll need to rely on---and maybe develop---a couple of key emotional intelligence competencies: empathy and emotional self-management. Why empathy? Empathy is a competency that al- lows you to read people. Who is supporting whom? Who is pissed off, and who is coasting? Where is the resistance? This isn't as easy as it seems. Sometimes, the smartest resisters often look like supporters, but they're not supportive at all. They're smart, sneaky idea killers. Carefully reading people will also help you under- stand the major and often hidden conﬂicts in the group. Hint: These conﬂicts probably have nothing to do with the topics discussed or decisions being

                         44

Empathy Is Key to a Great Meeting

made at the meeting. They are far more likely to be linked to very human dynamics like who is allowed to inﬂuence whom (headquarters vs. the ﬁeld, expats vs. local nationals) and power dynamics between gen- ders and among people of various races. Empathy lets you see and manage these power dynamics. Many of us would like to think that these sorts of concerns---and ofﬁce politics in general---are beneath us, unimportant, or just for those Machiavel- lian folks we all dislike. Realistically, though, power is hugely important in groups because it is the real currency in most organizations. And it plays out in meetings. Learning to read how the ﬂow of power is moving and shifting can help you lead the meeting--- and everything else. Keep in mind that employing empathy will help you understand how people are responding to you. As a leader you may be the most powerful person at the meeting. Some people, the dependent types, will de- fer at every turn. That feels good, for a minute. Carry on that way, and you're likely to create a dependent

                             45

Empathy

group---or one that is polarized between those who will do anything you want and those who will not. This is where emotional self-management comes in, for a couple of reasons. First, take a look at the dependent folks in your meetings. Again, it can feel really good to have people admire you and agree with your every word. In fact, this can be a huge relief in our conﬂict-ridden organizations. But again, if you don't manage your response, you will make group dy- namics worse. You will also look like a fool. Others are reading the group, too, and they will rightly read that you like it when people go along with you. They will see that you are falling prey to your own ego or to those who want to please or manipulate you. Second, strong emotions set the tone for the entire group. We take our cue from one another about how to feel about what's going on around us. Are we in danger? Is there cause for celebration? Should we be fed up and cynical or hopeful and committed? Here's why this matters in meetings: If you, as a leader, ef- fectively project out your more positive emotions,

                          46

Empathy Is Key to a Great Meeting

such as hope and enthusiasm, others will "mirror" these feelings and the general tone of the group will be marked by optimism and a sense of "we're in this together, and we can do it."3 And there is a strong neurological link between feelings and cognition. We think more clearly and more creatively when our feel- ings are largely positive and when we are appropri- ately challenged.4 The other side of the coin is obvious. Your negative emotions are also contagious, and they are almost always destructive if unchecked and unmanaged. Express anger, contempt, or disrespect, and you will deﬁnitely push people into ﬁght mode---individually and collectively. Express disdain, and you'll alien- ate people far beyond the end of the meeting. And it doesn't matter who you feel this way about. All it takes is for people to see it, and they will catch it--- and worry that next time your target will be them. This is not to say that all positive emotions are good all the time or that you should never express negative emotions. The point is that the leader's

                             47

Empathy

emotions are highly infectious. Know this and man- age your feelings accordingly to create the kind of en- vironment where people can work together to make decisions and get things done. It may go without saying, but you can't do any of this with your phone on. As Daniel Goleman shares in his book Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence, we are not nearly as good at multitasking as we think we are. Actually we stink at it. So turn it off and pay attention to the people you are with today. In the end, it's your job to make sure people leave your meeting feeling pretty good about what's hap- pened, their contributions, and you as the leader. Empathy allows you to read what's going on, and self- management helps you move the group to a mood that supports getting things done---and happiness.

    It’s Harder

to Empathize with People If You've Been in Their Shoes

By Rachel Ruttan, Mary-Hunter McDonnell, and Loran Nordgren

                  51

I magine that you have just become a new parent. Overwhelmed and exhausted, your performance at work is suffering. You desperately want to work from home part time to devote more attention to your family. One of your supervisors has had children while climbing the corporate ladder, while the other hasn't. Which supervisor is more likely to embrace your request? Most people would recommend approaching the supervisor who has children, drawing on the intu- ition that shared experience breeds empathy. After all, she has "been there" and thus would seem best placed to understand your situation.

                         53

Empathy

Our recent research suggests that this instinct is very often wrong.1 In a series of recent experiments, we found that people who have endured challenges in the past (like divorce or being skipped over for a promotion) were less likely to show compassion for someone facing the same struggle, compared with people with no experi- ence in that particular situation. In the ﬁrst experiment, we surveyed people par- ticipating in a "polar plunge": a jump into a very icy Lake Michigan in March. All participants read a story about a man named Pat who intended to complete the plunge but chickened out and withdrew from the event at the last minute. Critically, participants read about Pat either before they had completed the plunge themselves or one week after. We found that polar plungers who had successfully completed the plunge were less compassionate and more contemp- tuous of Pat than were those who had not yet com- pleted the plunge.

                          54

It's Harder to Empathize with People If You've Been in Their Shoes

In another study, we looked at compassion toward an individual struggling with unemployment. More than 200 people read a story about a man who---de- spite his best efforts---is unable to ﬁnd a job. Strug- gling to make ends meet, the man ultimately stoops to selling drugs in order to earn money. We found that people who had overcome a period of unemploy- ment in the past were less compassionate and more judgmental of the man than people who were cur- rently unemployed or had never been involuntarily unemployed. A third study examined compassion toward a bul- lied teenager. Participants were told either that the teen was successfully coping with the bullying or that he failed to cope by lashing out violently. Compared with participants who had no experience with bully- ing, participants who reported having been bullied in the past themselves were more compassionate to- ward the teen who was appropriately coping with the experience. But, as in our earlier studies, participants

                                55

Empathy

who were bullied in the past were the least compas- sionate toward the teen who failed to successfully cope with the bullying. Taken together, these results suggest that people who have endured a difﬁcult experience are particu- larly likely to penalize those who struggle to cope with a similar ordeal. But why does this occur? We suggest that this phe- nomenon is rooted in two psychological truths. First, people generally have difﬁculty accurately recalling just how difﬁcult a past aversive experience was. Though we may remember that a past experi- ence was painful, stressful, or emotionally trying, we tend to underestimate just how painful that experi- ence felt in the moment. This phenomenon is called an "empathy gap."2 Second, people who have previously overcome an aversive experience know that they were able to suc- cessfully overcome it, which makes them feel espe- cially conﬁdent about their understanding of just how

                            56

It's Harder to Empathize with People If You've Been in Their Shoes

difﬁcult the situation is. The combined experience of "I can't recall how difﬁcult it was" and "I know that I got through it myself " creates the perception that the event can be readily conquered, reducing empathy toward others struggling with the event. This ﬁnding seems to run counter to our intu- itions. When we asked participants to predict who would show the most compassion for the bullied teenager, for instance---a teacher who'd endured bul- lying himself or one who never had---an overwhelm- ing 99 out of the 112 people chose the teacher who had been bullied. This means that many people may be instinctively seeking compassion from the very people who are least likely to provide it. This clearly has implications for peer-to-peer of- ﬁce communication (choose the person you vent to carefully). And mentorship programs, which often pair people from similar backgrounds or experiences, may need to be reexamined. But there are also im- portant lessons for leaders. When approached by

                                 57

Empathy

employees in distress, leaders may believe that their own emotional reaction to the issue should guide their response. For example, an executive who broke the glass ceiling may focus on her own success when considering an employee's concerns about discrimi- nation. Similarly, managers in overworked indus- tries such as consulting and banking may respond to employees' concerns about burnout and fatigue with comments such as, "I had to work those hours, so why are you complaining?" (And in fact, there is some evidence that this mechanism is at play when older workers push back on reforms designed to help cut down on overwork.)3 Simply put, leaders need to get outside of their own heads---to place less emphasis, not more, on their own past challenges. To bridge the empathy gap, leaders may be best served by focusing on how upset the other person seems to be or by reminding themselves that many others struggle with the same challenge. Returning to the opening example, the

                          58

It's Harder to Empathize with People If You've Been in Their Shoes

supervisor approached by an exhausted new parent could instead think about the countless other new parents who struggle to ﬁnd work-life balance, many of whom are ultimately pushed out of the workplace. When we're trying to encourage someone to be more empathetic, we often say something like, "walk a mile in his shoes." As it turns out, that may be ex- actly the wrong thing to say to people who have worn those shoes themselves.

Becoming Powerful Makes You Less Empathetic

    By Lou Solomon

L ast year, I worked with a senior executive---let's call him Steve---who had received feedback from his boss that he was wearing the power of his new title in an off-putting way. Steve's boss told him that he had developed a subtle way of be- ing right in meetings that sucked all the oxygen out of the room. No one wanted to offer ideas once Steve had declared the right answer. Since his promotion, Steve had become less of a team player and more of a superior who knew better than others. In short, he had lost his empathy. Why does this sort of shift in behavior happen to so many people when they're promoted to the ranks

of management? Research shows that personal power actually interferes with our ability to empa- thize. Dacher Keltner, an author and social psycholo- gist at the University of California, Berkeley, has con- ducted empirical studies showing that people who have power suffer deﬁcits in empathy, the ability to read emotions, and the ability to adapt behaviors to other people. In fact, power can actually change how the brain functions, according to research from Sukhvinder Obhi, a neuroscientist at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario, Canada.1 The most common leadership failures don't in- volve fraud, the embezzlement of funds, or sex scan- dals. It's more common to see leaders fail in the area of every day self-management---and the use of power in a way that is motivated by ego and self-interest. How does it happen? Slowly, and then suddenly. It happens with bad mini choices, made perhaps on an unconscious level. It might show up as the subtle act of throwing one's weight around. Demands for spe-

cial treatment, isolated decision making, and getting one's way. Leaders who are pulled over by the police for speeding or driving drunk become indignant and rail, "Do you know who I am?" Suddenly the story hits social media, and we change our minds about the once-revered personality. This points to a bigger story about power and fame. How do people start out in pursuit of a dream and wind up aggrandizing themselves instead? They reach a choke point, where they cross over from be- ing generous with their power to using their power for their own beneﬁt. Take the case of former Charlotte, North Carolina, mayor Patrick Cannon. Cannon came from nothing. He overcame poverty and the violent loss of his father at the age of 5. He earned a degree from North Caro- lina A&T State University and entered public ser- vice at the age of 26, becoming the youngest council member in Charlotte history. He was known for be- ing completely committed to serving the public and

                            65

Empathy

generous with the time he spent as a role model for young people. But in 2014, Cannon, then 47, pleaded guilty to ac- cepting \$50,000 in bribes while in ofﬁce.2 As he en- tered the city's federal courthouse, he tripped and fell. The media was there to capture the fall, which was symbolic of the much bigger fall of an elected leader and small business owner who once embodied the very essence of personal achievement against stagger- ing odds. Cannon now has the distinction of being the ﬁrst mayor in the city's history to be sent to prison. In- siders say he was a good man but all too human, and he seemed vulnerable as he became isolated in his de- cision making. And while a local minister argued that Cannon's one lapse in judgment should not deﬁne the man and his career of exceptional public service, he is now judged only by his weakness: his dramatic move from humility and generosity to corruption. And that image of Cannon tripping on his way into court is now the image that people associate with him.

Becoming Powerful Makes You Less Empathetic

What can leaders do if they fear that they might be crossing the line from power to abuse of power? First, you must invite other people in. You must be willing to risk vulnerability and ask for feedback. A good executive coach can help you return to a state of empathy and value-driven decisions. However, be sure to ask for feedback from a wide variety of people. Dispense with the softball questions (How am I do- ing?) and ask the tough ones (How does my style and focus affect my employees?). Preventive maintenance begins with self-aware- ness and a daring self-inventory. Here are some im- portant questions to ask yourself:

1.  Do you have a support network of friends, family, and colleagues who care about you without the title and can help you stay down-to-earth?

2.  Do you have an executive coach, mentor, or conﬁdant?

                          67

     Empathy

3.  What feedback have you gotten about not walking the talk?

4.  Do you demand privileges?

5.  Are you keeping the small, inconvenient promises that fall outside of the spotlight?

6.  Do you invite others into the spotlight?

7.  Do you isolate yourself in the decision-making process? Do the decisions you're making reﬂect what you truly value?

8.  Do you admit your mistakes?

9.  Are you the same person at work, at home, and in the spotlight?

10. Do you tell yourself there are exceptions or different rules for people like you?

If a leader earns our trust, we hold them to non- negotiable standards. Nothing will blow up more dra- matically than a failure to walk the talk or the selﬁsh

                          68

Becoming Powerful Makes You Less Empathetic

abuse of power. We all want our leaders to be highly competent, visionary, take-charge people. However, empathy, authenticity, and generosity are what dis- tinguish competence and greatness. The most self- aware leaders recognize the signals of abuse of power and correct course before it's too late.

A Process for Empathetic Product Design

    By Jon Kolko
        71

T he discipline of product management is shift- ing from an external focus on the market, or an internal focus on technology, to an empa- thetic focus on people. While it's not too difﬁcult to rally people around this general idea, it can be hard at ﬁrst to understand how to translate it into tactics. So in this article, I'll walk through how we applied this approach to a particular product at a startup and how it led to large-scale adoption and, ultimately, the acquisition of the company. I was previously VP of design at MyEdu, where we focused on helping students succeed in college, show their academic accomplishments, and gain

                          73

Empathy

employment. MyEdu started with a series of free aca- demic planning tools, including a schedule planner. As we formalized a business model focused on col- lege recruiting, we conducted behavioral, empathetic research with college students and recruiters. This type of qualitative research focuses on what people do, rather than what they say. We spent hours with students in their dorm rooms, watching them do their homework, watch TV, and register for classes. We watched them being college students, and our goal was not to identify workﬂow conﬂicts or utilitar- ian problems to solve; it was to build a set of intui- tive feelings about what it means to be a college stu- dent. We conducted the same form of research with recruiters, watching them speak to candidates and work through their hiring process. This form of research is misleadingly simple---you go and watch people. The challenge is in forging a disarming relationship with people in a very short period of time. Our goal is to form a master and ap-

                         74

prentice relationship: We enter these research activi- ties as a humble apprentice, expecting to learn from a master. It may sound a little funny, but college stu- dents are masters of being in academia, with all of the successes and failures this experience brings them. As we complete our research, we transcribe the session in full. This time-consuming effort is critical, because it embeds the participants' collective voice in our heads. As we play, type, pause, and rewind our recordings, we begin to quite literally think from the perspective of the participant. I've found that I can repeat participant quotes and "channel" their voices years after a research session is over. We distribute the transcriptions into thousands of individual utter- ances, and then we post the utterances all over our war room. The input of our behavioral research is a proﬁle of the type of people we want to empathize with. The output of our research is a massive data set of verbatim utterances, exploded into individual, moveable parts.

                              75

Empathy

Once we've generated a large quantity of data, our next step is to synthesize the contents into meaning- ful insights. This is an arduous, seemingly endless process---it will quite literally ﬁll any amount of time you allot to it. We read individual notes, highlight salient points, and move the notes around. We build groups of notes in a bottom-up fashion, identifying similarities and anomalies. We invite the entire prod- uct team to participate: If they have 15 or 30 min- utes, they are encouraged to pop in, read some notes, and shift them to places that make sense. Over time, the room begins to take shape. As groupings emerge, we give them action-oriented names. Rather than us- ing pithy category labels like "Career Service" or "Em- ployment," we write initial summary statements like "Students write résumés in order to ﬁnd jobs." When we've made substantial progress, we begin to provoke introspection on the categories by asking "why"-oriented questions. And the key to the whole process is that we answer these questions even though

                          76

A Process for Empathetic Product Design

we don't know the answer for sure. We combine what we know about students with what we know about ourselves. We build on our own life experiences, and as we leverage our student-focused empathetic lens, we make inferential leaps. In this way, we drive in- novation and simultaneously introduce risk. In this case, we asked the question, "Why do students de- velop résumés to ﬁnd jobs?" and answered it, "Be- cause they think employers want to see a résumé." This is what Roger Martin refers to as "abductive reasoning": a form of logical recombination to move past the expected and into the provocative world of innovation.1 Finally, when we've answered these "why" ques- tions about each group, we create a series of insight statements, which are provocative statements of truth about human behavior. We'll build upon the why statement, abstracting our answer away from the stu- dents we spent time with and making a generaliza- tion about all students. We asked, "Why do students

                             77

Empathy

develop résumés to ﬁnd jobs?" and we answered it, "Because they think employers want to see a résumé." Now we'll craft an insight statement: "Students think they have an idea of what employers want in a candi- date, but they are often wrong." We've shifted from a passive statement to an active assertion. We've made a large inferential leap. And we've arrived at the scaf- fold for a new product, service, or idea. We can create a similar provocative statement of truth about recruiters by learning from employers. Based on our research, we identiﬁed that recruiters spend very little time with each résumé but have very strong opinions about candidates. Our insight state- ment becomes "Recruiters make snap judgments, directly impacting a candidate's chances of success." (See table 1.) The input of our synthesis process is the raw data from research, transcribed and distributed on a large wall. The output of our synthesis process is a series of insights: provocative statements of truth about hu- man behavior.

                          78

Now we can start to merge and compare insights in order to arrive at a value proposition. As we con- nect the two insights from students and employers and juxtapose them, we can narrow in on a "what-if " opportunity. What if we taught students new ways to think about ﬁnding a job? What if we showed stu- dents alternative paths to jobs? What if we helped students identify their skills and present them to em- ployers in a credible way? (See table 2.) If we subtly shift the language, we arrive at a ca- pability value proposition: "MyEdu helps students identify their skills and present them to employers in a credible way." This value proposition is a promise. We promise to students that if they use our products, we'll help them identify their skills and show those skills to em- ployers. If we fail to deliver on that promise, students have a poor experience with our products---and leave. The same is true for any product or service company.

home but doesn't, we get frustrated. If they fail fre- quently enough, we dump them for a company with a similar or better value proposition. Insights act as the input to this phase in the empa- thetic design process, and the output of this process is an emotionally charged value promise. Armed with a value proposition, we have con- straints around what we're building. In addition to providing an external statement of value, this state- ment also indicates how we can determine if the ca- pabilities, features, and other details we brainstorm

                                 81

Empathy

are appropriate to include in the offering. If we dream up a new feature and it doesn't help students identify their skills and present them to employers in a credible way, it's not appropriate for us to build. The value promise becomes the objective criteria in a subjective context, acting as a sieve through which we can pour our good ideas. Now we tell stories---what we call "hero ﬂows," or the main paths through our products that help peo- ple become happy or content. These stories paint a picture of how a person uses our product to receive the value promise. We write these, draw them as stick ﬁgures, and start to sketch the real product inter- faces. And then, through a fairly standard product development process, we bring these stories to life with wireframes, visual comps, motion studies, and other traditional digital product assets. Through this process, we developed the MyEdu Proﬁle: a highly visual record that helps students

                           82

A Process for Empathetic Product Design

highlight academic accomplishments and present them to employers in the context of recruiting. During research, we heard from some college stu- dents that "LinkedIn makes me feel dumb." They don't have a lot of professional experiences, so asking them to highlight these accomplishments is a non- starter. But as students use our academic planning tools, their behavior and activities translate to proﬁle elements that highlight their academic accomplish- ments: We can deliver on our value proposition. Our value proposition acts as the input to the core of product development. The output of this process is our products, which facilitate the iterative, incre- mental set of capabilities that shift behavior and help people achieve their wants, needs, and desires. The LinkedIn example we highlighted illustrates what we call "empathetic research." We marinated in data and persevered through a rigorous process of sense making in order to arrive at insights. We

                             83

Empathy

leveraged these insights to provoke a value proposi- tion, and then we built stories on top of the entire scaffold. And as a result of this process, we created a product with emotional resonance. The proﬁle prod- uct attracted more than a million college students in about a year, and during a busy academic registration period, we saw growth of between 3,000 to 3,500 new student proﬁles a day. After we were acquired by education software company Blackboard and integrated this into the ﬂagship learning manage- ment system, we saw growth of between 18,000 and 20,000 new student proﬁles a day. The process described here is not hard, and it's not new---companies like Frog Design have been le- veraging this approach for years, and I learned the fundamentals of empathetic design when I was an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon. But for most companies, this process requires leaning on a dif- ferent corporate ideology. It's a process informed by deep qualitative data rather than statistical market

data. It celebrates people rather than technology. And it requires identifying and believing in behavioral in- sights, which are subjective and, in their ambiguity, full of risk.

How Facebook Uses Empathy to Keep User Data Safe

By Melissa Luu-Van

          87

O nline security often focuses on technical details: software, hardware, vulnerabilities, and the like. But effective security is driven as much by people as it is by technology. After all, the point is to protect the consumers, employees, and partners who use our products. The ways those people interact with technology and each other can completely change the effective- ness of your security strategy. So security products and tools must take into account the human context of the problems they're solving---and that requires empathy.

                         89

Empathy

At Facebook, empathy helps us create solutions that work because they're designed around our users' experiences and well-being. Speciﬁcally, we see three ways to make security efforts more empathetic.

Consumer-driven goals that are actionable and spe- ciﬁc. By researching the cultural and physical con- texts in which people use the things you produce, you can deﬁne better, more precise goals for those products. Engaging with your users on a regular ba- sis---through reporting tools built into your product, online surveys, or focus groups, for example---is a necessary step for understanding, rather than as- suming you know, their challenges and needs. For example, we recently asked several focus groups about their most important security concerns on Facebook. What are they worried about? What would help them feel safe? Overwhelmingly, people told us they wanted more control. Simply knowing that Facebook was working behind the scenes to pro-

                         90

How Facebook Uses Empathy to Keep User Data Safe

tect their accounts wasn't enough. We learned that many Facebook users were unaware of all the security features we offer to add extra protection to their ac- counts. But once they learned about them, they were eager to use them. People also wanted to be able to control these features and to see how each tool pro- tects their account. These ﬁndings told us two very important things about the security features. First, they needed to be easier to ﬁnd. Second, they needed to be more visible and give people more control. With that in mind, we created Security Checkup, a tool designed to make Facebook's security controls more visible and easier to use. During early testing and after our global launch, we asked people on Face- book about their experience using the new tool. They told us they found Security Checkup useful and help- ful; the tool's completion rate quickly soared to over 90%. These results are validating---but not surpris- ing, since we tailored Security Checkup to what we had learned about people's preferences and concerns.

                            91

Empathy

Our primary goal has always been to protect the people who use Facebook, but through our research we've added the goal of helping people better pro- tect themselves wherever they are on the web. The security lessons our users learn on Facebook could help them develop safer online habits---such as using unique passwords or checking app permissions---that can be used on other sites, too.

Collaborative, cross-functional teams. Security is often approached as an engineering-led effort in which cross-functional teams from research, design, or product are less important. However, we've found that disciplines besides engineering are just as criti- cal to the thought process and product develop- ment, because diversity of thought is an important characteristic of empathy. Cross-functional teams are particularly valuable for thinking through the various experiences people may have with a product. Car manufacturers have

                          92

How Facebook Uses Empathy to Keep User Data Safe

done this for years, adding seat belts and air bags to keep people safe even when a vehicle performs outside its intended purpose (that is, during a high- speed crash). The cars' designs were changed to make people's experiences safer by default. Similarly, Face- book's security tools are built with the belief that bet- ter product design leads to safer behavior. Many of our departments collaborate for this purpose, includ- ing research, security, user experience, marketing, product design, and communications. Throughout various stages of the process, these teams convene to discuss potential engineering, de- sign, or security challenges; identify solutions; and consider the impact any of these things might have on someone's overall experience using our products. We believe this collective expertise helps us avoid possible issues by addressing them early on in the development process. For example, during early it- erations of Security Checkup we realized that simply drawing attention to our existing security features

                             93

Empathy

was interpreted by some people as a warning or alert that something was wrong. Because we had design and communication experts already working on the development team, we were able to create a security tool with a utilitarian tone to avoid making people feel unnecessarily concerned.

A focus on outcomes rather than inputs. Finally, and most important, empathy helps us keep people safe. If people don't have a safe experience, it doesn't matter how many security tools we make. That's why people's actual outcomes are always our highest priority. Empathy helps in a couple of ways. First, having empathy for the people who use your products keeps you focused on helping them make small but useful tweaks (rather than major overhauls) to their online behavior. Because online security can be a daunting topic, many people shy away from be- ing proactive about it. So encouraging people to start with small steps can go a long way. We've seen that

                         94

How Facebook Uses Empathy to Keep User Data Safe

even incremental progress helps people learn how to recognize risk and make safer choices. Simple behav- iors like turning on extra security settings for online accounts can have a huge impact on someone's safety. Second, using empathetic language in consumer communication makes security less intimidating and more accessible. This means using terms and con- cepts that are easily understood within local cultural and languages, even if they differ from the terms technical experts would use. Research shows that over time, fearful communications designed to scare people actually have a diminishing rate of return in helping consumers avoid online threats. On the other hand, building resiliency can help people better understand potential threats, recover from mistakes, and identify the most important preventative actions. If you want to increase empathy on your team, one of the best ways to do it is to invite a diverse set of dis- ciplines to be part of the product development pro- cess, both through hiring and through collaborating

                             95

Empathy

with other teams. Professionals with experience in psychology, behavioral sciences, or communications can bring invaluable perspectives for building an em- pathetic team. Then invest in research to understand the experience and security concerns of the people using your products; don't guess or assume you know what they are. Empathy is not easy. It requires a commitment to deeply understanding the people you're protecting--- but it also leads to signiﬁcantly better security. And that's the whole point.

The Limits of Empathy

By Adam Waytz

       97

A few years ago, Ford Motor Company started asking its (mostly male) engineers to wear the Empathy Belly, a simulator that allows them to experience symptoms of pregnancy ﬁrst- hand---the back pain, the bladder pressure, the 30 or so pounds of extra weight. They can even feel "move- ments" that mimic fetal kicking. The idea is to get them to understand the ergonomic challenges that pregnant women face when driving, such as limited reach, shifts in posture and center of gravity, and general bodily awkwardness. It's unclear whether this has improved Ford's cars or increased customer satisfaction, but the engineers

                         99

Empathy

claim beneﬁts from the experience. They're still using the belly; they're also simulating the foggy vision and stiff joints of elderly drivers with an "age suit." If noth- ing more, these exercises are certainly an attempt to "get the other person's point of view," which Henry Ford once famously said was the key to success. Empathy is all the rage pretty much everywhere--- not just at Ford and not just on engineering and product development teams. It's at the heart of de- sign thinking and innovation more broadly deﬁned. It's also touted as a critical leadership skill---one that helps you inﬂuence others in your organization, an- ticipate stakeholders' concerns, respond to social me- dia followers, and even run better meetings. But recent research (by me and many others) sug- gests that all this heat and light may be a bit too in- tense. Though empathy is essential to leading and managing others---without it, you'll make disastrous decisions and forfeit the beneﬁts just described---

                            100

The Limits of Empathy

failing to recognize its limits can impair individual and organizational performance. Here are some of the biggest problems you can run into and recommendations for getting around them.

            Problem #1: It’s exhausting

Like heavy-duty cognitive tasks, such as keeping mul- tiple pieces of information in mind at once or avoid- ing distractions in a busy environment, empathy depletes our mental resources. So jobs that require constant empathy can lead to "compassion fatigue," an acute inability to empathize that's driven by stress, and burnout, a more gradual and chronic version of this phenomenon. Health and human services professionals (doctors, nurses, social workers, corrections ofﬁcers) are espe- cially at risk, because empathy is central to their day- to-day jobs. In a study of hospice nurses, for example,

                           101

Empathy

the key predictors for compassion fatigue were psy- chological: anxiety, feelings of trauma, life demands, and what the researchers call excessive empathy, meaning the tendency to sacriﬁce one's own needs for others' (rather than simply "feeling" for people).1 Variables such as long hours and heavy caseloads also had an impact, but less than expected. And in a sur- vey of Korean nurses, self-reported compassion fa- tigue strongly predicted their intentions to leave their jobs in the near future.2 Other studies of nurses show additional consequences of compassion fatigue, such as absenteeism and increased errors in administering medication. People who work for charities and other nonprof- its (think animal shelters) are similarly at risk. Volun- tary turnover is exceedingly high, in part because of the empathically demanding nature of the work; low pay exacerbates the element of self-sacriﬁce. What's more, society's strict views of how nonproﬁts should operate mean they face a backlash when they act like

                          102

The Limits of Empathy

businesses (for instance, investing in "overhead" to keep the organization running smoothly). They're ex- pected to thrive through selﬂess outpourings of com- passion from workers. The demand for empathy is relentless in other sectors as well. Day after day, managers must moti- vate knowledge workers by understanding their ex- periences and perspectives and helping them ﬁnd personal meaning in their work. Customer service professionals must continually quell the concerns of distressed callers. Empathy is exhausting in any set- ting or role in which it's a primary aspect of the job.

             Problem #2: It’s zero-sum

Empathy doesn't just drain energy and cognitive resources---it also depletes itself. The more empa- thy I devote to my spouse, the less I have left for my mother; the more I give to my mother, the less I can give my son. Both our desire to be empathic and the

                           103

Empathy

effort it requires are in limited supply, whether we're dealing with family and friends or customers and colleagues. Consider this study: Researchers examined the trade-offs associated with empathic behaviors at work and at home by surveying 844 workers from various sectors, including hairstylists, ﬁreﬁghters, and tele- com professionals.3 People who reported workplace behaviors such as taking "time to listen to coworkers' problems and worries" and helping "others who have heavy workloads" felt less capable of connecting with their families. They felt emotionally drained and bur- dened by work-related demands. Sometimes the zero-sum problem leads to another type of trade-off: Empathy toward insiders---say, people on our teams or in our organizations---can limit our capacity to empathize with people outside our immediate circles. We naturally put more time and effort into understanding the needs of our close friends and colleagues. We simply ﬁnd it easier to do,

                         104

The Limits of Empathy

because we care more about them to begin with. This uneven investment creates a gap that's widened by our limited supply of empathy: As we use up most of what's available on insiders, our bonds with them get stronger, while our desire to connect with outsiders wanes. Preferential empathy can antagonize those who see us as protecting our own (think about how people reacted when the Pope praised the Catholic Church's handling of sexual abuse). It can also, a bit more sur- prisingly, lead to insiders' aggression toward outsid- ers. For example, in a study I conducted with Univer- sity of Chicago professor Nicholas Epley, we looked at how two sets of participants---those sitting with a friend (to prime empathic connection) and those sit- ting with a stranger---would treat a group of terror- ists, an outgroup with particularly negative associa- tions. After describing the terrorists, we asked how much participants endorsed statements portraying them as subhuman, how acceptable waterboarding

                          105

Empathy

them would be, and how much voltage of electric shock they would be willing to administer to them. Merely sitting in a room with a friend signiﬁ- cantly increased people's willingness to torture and dehumanize. Although this study represents an extreme case, the same principle holds for organizations. Compas- sion for one's own employees and colleagues some- times produces aggressive responses toward others. More often, insiders are simply uninterested in em- pathizing with outsiders---but even that can cause people to neglect opportunities for constructive col- laboration across functions or organizations.

          Problem #3: It can erode ethics

Finally, empathy can cause lapses in ethical judg- ment. We saw some of that in the study about ter- rorists. In many cases, though, the problem stems not from aggression toward outsiders but, rather,

                         106

The Limits of Empathy

from extreme loyalty toward insiders. In making a fo- cused effort to see and feel things the way people who are close to us do, we may take on their interests as our own. This can make us more willing to overlook transgressions or even behave badly ourselves. Multiple studies in behavioral science and deci- sion making show that people are more inclined to cheat when it serves another person.4 In various set- tings, with the beneﬁts ranging from ﬁnancial to reputational, people use this ostensible altruism to rationalize their dishonesty. It only gets worse when they empathize with another's plight or feel the pain of someone who is treated unfairly: In those cases, they're even more likely to lie, cheat, or steal to ben- eﬁt that person. In the workplace, empathy toward fellow employ- ees can inhibit whistle-blowing---and when that hap- pens, it seems scandals often follow. Just ask the po- lice, the military, Penn State University, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and WorldCom. The kinds of problems

                           107

Empathy

that have plagued those organizations---brutality, sexual abuse, fraud---tend to be exposed by outsiders who don't identify closely with the perpetrators. In my research with Liane Young and James Dun- gan of Boston College, we studied the effects of loy- alty on people using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, an online marketplace where users earn money for com- pleting tasks. At the beginning of the study, we asked some participants to write an essay about loyalty and others to write about fairness. Later in the study, they were each exposed to poor work by someone else. Those who had received the loyalty nudge were less willing to blow the whistle on a fellow user for infe- rior performance. This ﬁnding complements research showing that bribery is more common in countries that prize collectivism.5 The sense of group belonging and interdependence among members often leads people to tolerate the offense. It makes them feel less accountable for it, diffusing responsibility to the col- lective whole instead of assigning it to the individual.

                          108

The Limits of Empathy

In short, empathy for those within one's immedi- ate circle can conﬂict with justice for all.

      How to rein in excessive empathy

These three problems may seem intractable, but as a manager you can do a number of things to mitigate them in your organization.

                   Split up the work

You might start by asking each employee to zero in on a certain set of stakeholders, rather than empathize with anyone and everyone. Some people can focus primarily on customers, for instance, and others on coworkers---think of it as creating task forces to meet different stakeholders' needs. This makes the work of developing relationships and gathering perspectives less consuming for individuals. You'll also accomplish

                           109

Empathy

more in the aggregate, by distributing "caring" re- sponsibilities across your team or company. Although empathy is ﬁnite for any one person, it's less bounded when managed across employees.

              Make it less of a sacriﬁce

Our mindsets can either intensify or lessen our sus- ceptibility to empathy overload. For example, we exacerbate the zero-sum problem when we assume that our own interests and others' are fundamentally opposed. (This often happens in deal making, when parties with different positions on an issue get stuck because they're obsessed with the gap between them.) An adversarial mindset not only prevents us from un- derstanding and responding to the other party but also makes us feel as though we've "lost" when we don't get our way. We can avoid burnout by seeking integrative solutions that serve both sides' interests. Take this example: A salary negotiation between a hiring manager and a promising candidate will be-

                          110

The Limits of Empathy

come a tug-of-war contest if they have different num- bers in mind and ﬁxate on the money alone. But let's suppose that the candidate actually cares more about job security, and the manager is keenly interested in avoiding turnover. Building security into the contract would be a win-win: an empathic act by the manager that wouldn't drain his empathy reserves the way making a concession on salary would, because keep- ing new hires around is in line with his own desires. There's only so much empathy to go around, but it's possible to achieve economies of sorts. By ask- ing questions instead of letting assumptions go un- checked, you can bring such solutions to the surface.

                Give people breaks

As a management and organizations professor, I cringe when students refer to my department's coursework---on leadership, teams, and negotiation--- as "soft skills." Understanding and responding to the needs, interests, and desires of other human beings

                          111

Empathy

involves some of the hardest work of all. Despite claims that empathy comes naturally, it takes ardu- ous mental effort to get into another person's mind--- and then to respond with compassion rather than indifference. We all know that people need periodic relief from technical and analytical work and from rote jobs like data entry. The same is true of empathy. Look for ways to give employees breaks. It's not sufﬁcient to encourage self-directed projects that also beneﬁt the company (and often result in more work), as Google did with its 20% time policy. Encourage individu- als to take time to focus on their interests alone. Re- cent research ﬁnds that people who take lots of self- focused breaks subsequently report feeling more empathy for others.6 That might seem counterintui- tive, but when people feel restored, they're better able to perform the demanding tasks of ﬁguring out and responding to what others need. How do you give people respite from thinking and caring about others? Some companies are purchasing

                          112

The Limits of Empathy

isolation chambers like Orrb Technologies' wellness and learning pods so that people can literally put themselves in a bubble to relax, meditate, or do what- ever else helps them recharge. McLaren, for example, uses the pods to train F1 supercar drivers to focus. Other companies, such as electrical parts distribu- tor Van Meter, are relying on much simpler interven- tions like shutting off employee email accounts when workers go on vacation to allow them to concentrate on themselves without interruption. Despite its limitations, empathy is essential at work. So managers should make sure employees are investing it wisely. When trying to empathize, it's generally better to talk with people about their experiences than to imagine how they might be feeling, as Nicholas Epley suggests in his book Mindwise. A recent study bears this out.7 Participants were asked how capable they thought blind people were of working and living in- dependently. But before answering the question, some were asked to complete difﬁcult physical tasks

                           113

Empathy

while wearing a blindfold. Those who had done the blindness simulation judged blind people to be much less capable. That's because the exercise led them to ask "What would it be like if I were blind?" (the answer: very difﬁcult!) rather than "What is it like for a blind person to be blind?" This ﬁnding speaks to why Ford's use of the Empathy Belly, while well- intentioned, may be misguided: After wearing it, en- gineers may overestimate or misidentify the difﬁcul- ties faced by drivers who actually are pregnant. Talking to people---asking them how they feel, what they want, and what they think---may seem simplistic, but it's more accurate. It's also less taxing to employees and their organizations, because it in- volves collecting real information instead of endlessly speculating. It's a smarter way to empathize.

    What the Dalai Lama Taught Daniel Goleman About Emotional Intelligence

An interview with Daniel Goleman by Andrea Ovans

                      117

T wo decades before Daniel Goleman ﬁrst wrote about emotional intelligence in the pages of HBR, he met the Dalai Lama at Amherst Col- lege. The Dalai Lama mentioned to the young science journalist for the New York Times that he was inter- ested in meeting with scientists. Thus began a long, rich friendship as Goleman became involved over the years in arranging a series of what he calls "extended dialogues" between the Buddhist spiritual leader and researchers in ﬁelds ranging from ecology to neuro- science. Over the next 30 years, as Goleman has pur- sued his own work as a psychologist and business thinker, he has come to see the Dalai Lama as a highly

                         119

Empathy

uncommon leader. And so he was understandably delighted when, on the occasion of his friend's 80th birthday, he was asked to write a book describing the Dalai Lama's compassionate approach to addressing the world's most intractable problems. Published in June 2015, Force for Good: The Dalai Lama's Vision for Our World, which draws both on Goleman's back- ground in cognitive science and his long relation- ship with the Dalai Lama, is both an exploration of the science and the power of compassion and a call to action. Curious about the book and about how the Dalai Lama's views on compassion informed Gole- man's thinking on emotional intelligence, I caught up with Goleman over the phone. What follows are edited excerpts from our conversation.

HBR: Let's start with some deﬁnitions here. What is compassion, as you are describing it? It sounds a lot like empathy, one of the major components of emo- tional intelligence. Is there a difference?

                           120

What the Dalai Lama Taught Goleman About Emotional Intelligence

Goleman: Yes, an important difference. As I've written about recently in HBR, three kinds of em- pathy are important to emotional intelligence: cog- nitive empathy---the ability to understand another person's point of view, emotional empathy---the ability to feel what someone else feels, and em- pathic concern---the ability to sense what another person needs from you \[see chapter 1, "What Is Empathy?"\]. Cultivating all three kinds of empa- thy, which originate in different parts of the brain, is important for building social relationships. But compassion takes empathy a step further. When you feel compassion, you feel distress when you witness someone else in distress---and because of that you want to help that person.

Why draw this distinction?

Simply put, compassion makes the difference be- tween understanding and caring. It's the kind of

                             121

Empathy

love that a parent has for a child. Cultivating it more broadly means extending that to the other people in our lives and to people we encounter. I think that in the workplace, that attitude has a hugely positive effect, whether it's in how we re- late to our peers, how we are as a leader, or how we relate to clients and customers. A positive dis- position toward another person creates the kind of resonance that builds trust and loyalty and makes interactions harmonious. And the opposite of that---when you do nothing to show that you care---creates distrust and disharmony and causes huge dysfunction at home and in business.

When you put it that way, it's hard to disagree that if you treat people well things would go better than if you don't or that if you cared about them they would care a lot more about you. So why do you think that doesn't just happen naturally? Is it a cultural thing? Or a misplaced confusion about when competition is appropriate?

                         122

What the Dalai Lama Taught Goleman About Emotional Intelligence

I think too often there's a muddle in people's think- ing that if I'm nice to another person or if I have their interests at heart it means that I don't have my own interests at heart. The pathology of that is, "Well, I'll just care about me and not the other person." And that, of course, is the kind of attitude that leads to lots of problems in the business realm and in the personal realm. But compassion also in- cludes yourself. If we protect ourselves and make sure we're okay---and also make sure the other per- son is okay---that creates a different framework for working with and cooperating with other people.

Could you give me an example of how that might work in the business world?

There's research that was done on star salespeople and on client managers that found that the low- est level of performance was a kind of "I'm going to get the best deal I can now, and I don't care how this affects the other person" attitude, which

                             123

Empathy

means that you might make the sale but that you lose the relationship. But at the top end, the stars were typiﬁed by the attitude, "I am working for the client as well as myself. I'm going to be completely straight with them, and I'm going to act as their advisor. If the deal I have is not the best deal they can get I'm going to let them know because that's going to strengthen the relationship, even though I might lose this speciﬁc sale." And I think that cap- tures the difference between the "me ﬁrst" and the "let's all do well" attitude that I'm getting at.

How would we cultivate compassion if we just weren't feeling it?

Neuroscientists have been studying compassion recently, and places like Stanford, Yale, UC Berke- ley, and the University of Wisconsin, Madison, among others, have been testing methodologies for increasing compassion. Right now there's a

                          124

What the Dalai Lama Taught Goleman About Emotional Intelligence

kind of a trend toward incorporating mindfulness into the workplace, and it turns out there's data from the Max Planck Institute showing that en- hancing mindfulness does have an effect in brain function but that the circuitry that's affected is not the circuitry for concern or compassion. In other words, there's no automatic boost in compassion from mindfulness alone. Still, in the traditional methods of meditation that mindfulness in the workplace is based on, the two were always linked, so that you would practice mindfulness in a context in which you'd also culti- vate compassion. Stanford, for example, has developed a program that incorporates secularized versions of methods that have originally come from religious practices. It involves a meditation in which you cultivate an attitude of loving-kindness or of concern, or of compassion, toward people. First you do this for yourself, then for people you love, then for people

                             125

Empathy

you just know. And ﬁnally you do it for everyone. And this has the effect of priming the circuitry re- sponsible for compassion within the brain so that you are more inclined to act that way when the op- portunity arises.

You've remarked that the Dalai Lama is a very dis- tinctive kind of leader. Is there something we could learn as leaders ourselves from his unique form of leadership?

Observing him over the years, and then doing this book for which I interviewed him extensively, and of course being immersed in leadership literature myself, three things struck me. The ﬁrst is that he's not beholden to any orga- nization at all. He's not in any business. He's not a party leader. He's a citizen of the world at large. And this has freed him to tackle the largest prob- lems we face. I think that to the extent that a

                         126

What the Dalai Lama Taught Goleman About Emotional Intelligence

leader is beholden to a particular organization or outcome, that creates a kind of myopia of what's possible and what matters. Focus narrows to the next quarter's results or the next election. He's way beyond that. He thinks in terms of genera- tions and of what's best for humanity as a whole. Because his vision is so expansive, he can take on the largest challenges, rather than small, narrowly deﬁned ones. So I think there's a lesson here for all of us, which is to ask ourselves if there is something that limits our vision---that limits our capacity to care. And is there a way to enlarge it? The second thing that struck me is that he gath- ers information from everywhere. He meets with heads of state, and he meets with beggars. He's getting information from people at every level of society worldwide. This casting a large net lets him understand situations in a very deep way, and he can analyze them in many different ways and come

                             127

Empathy

up with solutions that aren't conﬁned by anyone. And I think that's another lesson everyday leaders can take from him. The third thing would be the scope of his com- passion, which I think is an ideal that we could strive for. It's pretty unlimited. He seems to care about everybody and the world at large.

You've said that the book is a call to action. What do you hope people will do after reading it?

The book is a call to action, but it is a very reasoned call to action. The Dalai Lama is a great believer in a deep analysis of problems and letting solutions come from that analysis. And then he is also pas- sionate about people acting now. Not feeling pas- sive, not feeling helpless, not feeling, "What's the point? I won't live to see the beneﬁt," but rather having them start changes now even if the change won't come to fruition until future generations.

                          128

What the Dalai Lama Taught Goleman About Emotional Intelligence

     So my hope, and his, is to help people under-

stand what they can do in the face of problems that are so vast: creating a more inclusive economy; making work meaningful; doing good and not just well; cleaning up injustice and unfairness, corrup- tion and collusion in society, whether in business, politics, or religion; helping the environment heal; the hope that one day conﬂict will be settled by di- alogue rather than war. These are very big issues. But everyone can do something to move things in the right direction, even if it's just reaching across the divide and be- coming friendly with someone who belongs to some other group. That actually has a very power- ful end result: If you have two groups somewhere in the world that have deep enmity toward each other, and yet a few people in each group like each other because they've had personal contact---they have a friend in that other group. So something as simple as reaching out across a divide is actually a

                             129

Empathy

profound thing. In each of these areas, with what- ever leverage we have, the point is to use it, not just to stand back.
