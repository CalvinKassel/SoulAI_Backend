### **Advanced Filtering System - "The Light Bulb Universe"**

**Stage 1: Dimensional Filtering**
- **Hue Compatibility:** Calculate circular distance, eliminate incompatible archetypes
- **Manifested Self Range:** Filter based on expression level compatibility
- **Soul Depth Resonance:** Ensure sufficient depth alignment

**Stage 2: Parameter-Level Filtering**
- Apply each of 50 parameters as filters
- Use confidence-weighted elimination
- Preserve uncertainty ranges for borderline cases

**Stage 3: Complementarity Assessment**
- Identify complementary opposites (e.g., 0° pairs with 180°)
- Calculate growth potential scores
- Factor in personality development potential

### **Sophisticated Distance Metrics**

**Primary Distance Calculation:**
```
distance = sqrt(
  (hue_distance/180)² * 0.4 +
  (manifested_difference/255)² * 0.3 +
  (soul_difference/255)² * 0.3
)
```

**Weighted Parameter Distance:**
```
parameter_distance = sum(
  (param_difference * confidence_weight * parameter_importance)
  for each of 50 parameters
)
```

**Final Compatibility Score:**
```
compatibility = (1 - distance) * parameter_alignment * complementarity_bonus
```

### **Compatibility Categories**

1. **Soulmate (90-100%):** Near-perfect alignment across all dimensions
2. **High Compatibility (80-89%):** Strong alignment with minor differences
3. **Good Match (70-79%):** Solid compatibility with growth potential
4. **Complementary (60-69%):** Different but mutually enhancing
5. **Growth-Oriented (50-59%):** Challenges that promote development
