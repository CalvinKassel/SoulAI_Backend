Beginning

Chapter One

Lightning Bolt

MY FAMILY AND I were driving through Yellowstone Park in the late spring
of 1996 when I got the news that changed the course of my life. I went
to a pay phone and found out that I had been elected president of the
American Psychological Association (APA). It was then, and remains now,
one of the greatest honors of my life. A few months later, I attended
the APA convention in Toronto as president-elect-elect (I'd become
president-elect the following year and president the year after that). I
was told that there was no place for me to sit on the floor of council,
and while the rank and file greeted me warmly, even effusively, I got
one cold shoulder after another from the establishment, whose chosen
candidate I had soundly defeated in the election. I returned from
Toronto dismayed, wondering if I could be effective on this national
stage. The answer came by way of epiphany. "GET TO WORK, Nikki," I
shouted irritably. It was three weeks after the

Toronto convention, and I was low. We were supposed to be weeding.
Nikki, however, was having a great time, throwing weeds in the air,
dancing, and singing. She startled when I shouted at her, walked away,
and slowly walked back. "Daddy, can I talk to you?" I nodded.

"Well, on my birthday, I decided that I was going to stop whining, and
that was the hardest thing I've ever done," Nikki Seligman said. "And if
I can stop whining, you can stop being such a grouch." Nikki Seligman
and the author, 1996. Photo courtesy of Mandy Seligman.

"Daddy, do you remember before my fifth birthday I was a whiner, I
whined every day?" I nodded. "Have you noticed that since my fifth
birthday, I haven't whined once?" I nodded. "Well, on my birthday, I
decided that I was going to stop whining, and that was the hardest thing
I've ever done. And if I can stop whining, you can stop being such a
grouch." I was stunned. Nikki was exactly right. First, I was a grouch
and proud of it. But it occurred to me for the very first time that
maybe any success I'd had was not because I could see every
flaw---because of my "critical intelligence"---but in spite of it. If
Nikki could change, so could I. I decided to change. Second, my
"remedial" view of raising my children was wrong. If I could correct all
my kid's errors---shouting at Nikki's indolence---I would somehow end up
with an exemplary child. What nonsense. Instead I had to identify what
Nikki was really good at---and I'd just seen it: gleaning insight into
other people---reward it, and help her to lead her life around her
strengths, not waste her time thanklessly correcting her weaknesses.
Most significantly, I got the idea that powered the rest of my life:

psychology could be explicitly about building the good life. The current
practice and science of psychology was half-baked. Psychology started
with the premise that not getting it wrong equaled getting it right. If
psychology could somehow eliminate all the ills of the world---mental
illness, prejudice, ignorance, poverty, pessimism, loneliness, and the
like ---human life would be at its best. But the absence of ill-being
does not equal the presence of well-being. Psychology could be about the
presence of happiness not merely about the absence of unhappiness. Not
getting it wrong does not equal getting it right. IN JANUARY 1997, I
threw myself into my work as president-elect of APA.

The possibility of a psychology of well-being had been percolating. But
it seemed like a long shot, and I wanted my presidency to leave a mark.
So on the day my term began, I hit the ground running and started work
on other, less adventurous initiatives. I visited with Steve Hyman, the
young director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Steve
was no colorless Washington bureaucrat, but a world-class intellect and
former professor of neuropsychiatry at Harvard. He and I shared a
passion: empirical evidence in treatment. "Steve," I said, "I won by the
largest vote in APA history, and I have a mandate. We have an opening
here to change the course of APA. Let's launch a program on
evidence-based psychotherapy." "If you can bring recalcitrant-old-APA
into the fold, Marty," Steve said, "I will find \$40 million to support
the research." VISIONS OF COOPERATION between science and practice and
the salvation

of APA danced in my head. I asked to attend a meeting of the influential
Council for the Advancement of Private Practice and Science (CAPPS)
---which had backed the losing candidate in the APA election but
remained vitally important to the discipline---to explain my vision. The
council deigned to allot me fifteen minutes, and I had my first
encounter with the machine I had just humiliated. It did not go well.
About twenty stony-faced committee members sat around an enormous table
in one of the many well-appointed seminar rooms in the luxurious new APA
office building. APA's treasurer, Jack MacKay, had wisely invested in
Washington, DC, real estate, and APA was now worth \$100 million. It was
perhaps the only national professional organization

well in the black. I launched into my pitch. The council members stared
at me as if I were an exotic bird that had flown in off course from
another planet, and my voice got louder than I wanted it to be. They
stared. I couldn't seem to make my voice softer and less shrill. These
people hated me. I thought, "I have defeated them in the election, and
they will have their revenge." As I described the possibilities for
putting psychotherapy on a lasting evidence-based platform, their faces
got even stonier and their stares more hostile. I concluded by telling
them that NIMH was willing to spend an unheard-of amount---\$40
million---to underwrite the search for evidence. This was my applause
line. There was dead silence. One question cut through the quiet, asked
by Stan Moldawsky, the group's next presidentdesignate. "What if the
evidence does not come out in our favor?" RON LEVANT, STAN'S right hand,
took me out for a drink. Brimming with

good cheer and friendliness, he said, "Marty, you are in deep shit." I
HAVE HAD a lot of good advice in my life, but since my student days, I'd

had only one true mentor: Ray Fowler. Ray was the CEO of APA, and unlike
the presidents who come and go, he was its institutional memory. He
defined his role as bringing out the best in its presidents. Years after
that meeting he confided in me that his best quality was his willingness
to suffer fools gladly, and at that moment I knew whom he had in mind.
Ray hailed from Alabama, where he was a well-known personality
psychologist, dissecting the characters of such celebrities as Howard
Hughes, and chairing the department of psychology at the university. He
was the soft-spoken, moderate, and civilized face of the "dirty dozen,"
the practitioners who had seized power from the science wing fifteen
years before, and he was immediately elected president of APA. APA
happened to collapse at that moment. Having invested heavily in
Psychology Today---a more foolish investment than Washington real
estate---it was penniless. The administration was fired, and Ray was
called on to become CEO. He did so, rescuing the organization, and
became its near-permanent chief executive. Ray was the very soul of
patience and moderation. He was the only APA officer who advised me that
my running for president was not

impossibly quixotic, and he encouraged me to go for it. In deep shit, I
turned to him now. "There are two kinds of leadership," Ray told me
after listening patiently as I described the CAPPS fiasco,
"transactional and transformational. You cannot possibly out-transact
these people. They sit on all the committees, and they have great
sitting power. They will outsit you. If you are not to fail, you will
need to be a transformational president. "Your job, Marty, is to
transform American psychology." WHEN I FIRST encountered psychology,
more than thirty years before my

stint as APA president, two warring factions in the field---the
behaviorists and the Freudians---were at a standoff. For all their
differences, they shared many of the same dogmas. Both focused on
misery. Neither took evolution seriously. Both believed that the past,
especially childhood trauma, frog-marches us into the future. Both
considered thinking and consciousness mere froth. They also shared many
of the same blind spots: happiness, virtue, free will, meaning,
creativity, and success. In short, they both missed everything that
makes life worth living. I have witnessed the transformation of
psychology, and at more than one pivotal moment, I led the
transformation. Psychology in my lifetime rejected these premises in
order to remove four huge blind spots. First, the discipline abandoned
behaviorism to embrace cognition and consciousness. Second, it realized
that evolution and the brain constrain what we can learn. Third, it
ended its fixation on only curing what is wrong to include building what
is right and positive in the world. Finally, it discovered that we are
drawn into the future rather than driven by the past. Together these
make up the new psychology of hope. This book tells the story of these
sweeping changes in psychology over the last five decades. I too came to
reject these four dogmas, and I tell the story of how the field was
transformed through the medium of how one psychologist was himself
transformed.

Chapter Two

Childhood

IT BEGAN, AS for many psychologists of my generation, when I first read
Sigmund Freud. I was thirteen years old, and my sister came home from
the University of Rochester for her summer vacation. Beth was my
exuberant and affectionate mentor from the time I was six. When I was
seven she taught me what a factorial was. Showing off to my secondgrade
class may have been my first display of academic hubris. When I was
nine, she read Flatland aloud to me,1 unveiling the marvels of geometry.
At twelve, I confessed to her that I had never read a whole book and
merely bluffed my way through seventh-grade book reports. So she locked
me in my bedroom with The Count of Monte Cristo and did not let me out
until I had read all of it. Eighteen hours later, I emerged, peed
copiously, and passed her quiz. I have never been without a novel since.
In the summer of 1955 she brought home Freud's Introductory Lectures on
Psychoanalysis.2 So I lay in the navy surplus hammock that stretched
between two emaciated pine trees outside our little camp in Lake
Luzerne, New York, and I could not put Freud down. Counting forward from
the date of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, I was born almost
exactly nine months later. My conception, I surmise, was a declaration
of optimism about the future by my parents, Irene and Adrian. Both of
them had lived troubled lives, and optimism did not come at all
naturally. My mother, Irene Brown, was born in 1905 in Nagyvarad
(meaning "big town"), Hungary---now Romania. She changed her birthdate
to 1906 when she married my father in 1931 since it was unseemly for the
bride to be older than the groom. Nagyvarad was a center of fashion and

culture and Jewish life until the Nazis "cleansed" it of Jews in 1944.
My grandmother (Elsa Bet Weinstock) died giving birth to Irene. It was
December 1905 in the Carpathians, and Irene, premature, was incubated in
the family oven and nursed to health by my grandfather. With the death
of his wife, Marten Brown lavished all his affection on tiny little
Irene. Bathed in such love, the first three years of my mother's life
must have been idyllic. But scarring events would soon cast her out of
paradise. Marten was a tailor who designed women's clothes, and he was
ambitious. This was the height of the Belle Époque, and Vienna at the
turn of the twentieth century was the center of the intellectual and
artistic universe. This was the Vienna of Freud, Ludwig Wittgenstein,
Gustav Mahler, Gustav Klimt, Karl Kraus, and the Strausses---it was the
place to be, but it was also a place of rising anti-Semitism. Marten, in
his midtwenties, must have yearned for Viennese life and applied to the
Academy of Fine Arts to study haute couture. Just a Jew from the
countryside, he was summarily rejected (as was Adolph Hitler, twice). So
he packed up Irene and decided to try his luck in Berlin. But not before
acquiring a second wife. I knew her only as "Granny Brown." Petite,
solid, outspoken, determined-jawed, fiery... and jealous, she was a
stepmother right out of Cinderella. The love that Marten lavished on his
firstborn daughter his wife should have instead, and she let him know
it. Marten withdrew from Irene, and even in her late eighties, Irene
teared up when she spoke about this rejection, a rejection that no
three-year-old could possibly understand, a rejection that any
three-year-old would only attribute to herself. Berlin proved no more
promising than Vienna, and Marten's haute couture hopes were again
dashed. So in 1911 he took his five-year-old daughter and his pregnant
wife to New York. They settled in the town of Tuckahoe, a few miles
north of the Big Apple, and Marten opened a tailor's shop. Irene's first
day of school was bittersweet. This was the age of the welcomed huddled
masses coming to America, and her class was full of newly landed kids.
The kindergarten teacher called on the children to share songs from
their homelands, and a Scottish girl sang. Irene knew exactly what was
going on and bursting with excitement waved her hand to be called on.
She so wanted to sing a Hungarian song. But since she spoke no English,
the teacher passed over her for the Irish girl on her right.

As she grew into a teenager, she was not passed over any more. She was
gorgeous---there is no other word: five-foot-one, full-figured, blonde,
and blue-eyed. She was well-spoken but reserved and very sympathetic of
manner---a girl you could pour your heart out to. But poverty took its
toll. Marten's tailor shop burned to the ground. Irene dropped out of
high school to help support the family as a legal secretary. In the
early hours of the morning, she often heard Marten sobbing in his
bedroom in despair over their dwindling finances. But all her suitors
during the Roaring Twenties may have been ample compensation. One of
them, a most persistent young law student, she brushed off repeatedly.
Not to be deterred, he sat mooning on her porch steps all evening,
waiting for Irene to return from her dates. By now she was engaged to a
wealthy dentist (there are family rumors of six engagements), and the
Great Depression had begun. One evening Adrian must have finally caught
her in the weak moment he was waiting for. He pounced, and their romance
began. Persistence was only one of Adrian's strengths. He was handsome,
but not head-turningly so like Irene: five-foot-nine, blonde,
barrelchested, and blue-eyed, with the deepest dimple in his chin. He
was also dazzlingly clever, ingratiating of conversation, and extremely
quick of mind. His parents, Sigmund and Matilda (née Beringer), had
emigrated from the Dutch border of Germany and from Alsace,
respectively, in the 1890s and married in New York City on the very last
day of the old century. Their firstborn, Bert, Adrian's big brother and
my uncle-to-be, was a strapping, ruddy, and domineering lad. He became a
millionaire in his twenties on the eve of the Great Depression and
founded a Wall Street trading firm. In a family scandal, he changed his
name to Sinclair upon marrying a Catholic---a cause for ostracism by the
Seligmans. Adrian, in contrast to Bert, was a sickly child, prone to
hiding at home from school when things got too rough. He had a childhood
lump in the throat that impeded swallowing, likely an anxiety condition
known as globus hystericus. It was quite prevalent in the days of Freud
but is rarely seen today. (If I think too hard about my own Adam's
apple, I can almost feel the lump arising. I will refrain and put off a
discussion of heritability until later in this book.) But Adrian skipped
four grades in school, zoomed his way through City College, got his
bachelor of laws degree from New York University School of Law and then
a Juris Doctor from Columbia, when the D in

"JD" meant that you wrote a real doctoral dissertation. His was about
Benito Mussolini's rise to power. He courted Irene successfully, and
they married in 1931, honeymooning in Atlantic City, then a classy
destination. And then came the crucial decision of his life. He was a
brilliant young lawyer, armed with a doctorate from Columbia Law School.
But it was the second year of the Great Depression. Lawyers were not out
of work, but much of the rest of America was, and clients were having
trouble paying up. Lawyers were still drawing salaries, but many of them
were poor. He was newly wed, and he and my mother both saw potential
disaster looming more readily than they saw opportunity. So he chose a
secure path: civil service. Low pay, steady work, no chance of ever
losing your job, but also no chance of scaling the heights of money or
power. No chance of standing eye to eye with Bert. Adrian took a job
reporting judges' decisions at the Court of Appeals (New York State's
highest court) and moved with Irene from the center of
power---Manhattan---to the provinces: Albany. Albany in 1931 was not a
boomtown and, in fact, hadn't been since the building of the Erie Canal
more than a century before. Its population had held steady at 130,000
for those one hundred years. While it was the capital of New York State
and domicile of politicians on the rise--- Theodore Roosevelt and
Franklin Roosevelt, soon to be president, to name just two---the
brightest lights escaped every weekend on the express train back to
Grand Central Station in Manhattan. Albany was settled by the Dutch in
the 1620s, and the prominent wealthy families were still named Ten Eyck,
Schuyler, VanDerZee, Pruyn, and Van Renselaer, with a couple of
Townsends and Livingstons thrown in for diversity. The decaying estate
of the patroon still stood high o'er the Hudson River. But the old
families eventually lost their political power to the Irish, who had
come en masse as laborers after the 1845--1852 potato famine. By 1920
Dan O'Connell's political machine ---a machine so all-powerful as to
make Jersey City and Chicago look like democracies---ran the city.
O'Connell passed out twenty-dollar bills from the living room of his
unpretentious row house in Colonie to voters in need, and the machine's
front man---Mayor Erastus Corning IV---lent it all a veneer of
gentility. Albany was as grubby as it was corrupt, and the Great
Depression

made it worse. Large numbers of "bums," looking for any work at all,
roamed the streets during the day and slept in cardboard boxes on the
banks of the Hudson River by night. The bums were white, and beneath
them on the social scale were the blacks, who were even more miserable
and drew even less public sympathy and attention. This was in good
weather. In the winters, when snow could pile up to four feet and the
temperature could sink below zero for a week, life was brutal, fragile,
and cheap. Civil servants and merchants made up the middle class, some
of whom hailed from Albany's sizable enclave of Jews. There were the old
Jewish families: the Sterns, Nathans, Mendelsons, and Barnets, the
Jewish upper crust. They had come to Albany in the mid-1800s, founded
Reform Judaism in America, owned the factories, and become prominent
pillars of the community---although they still could not join the Fort
Orange Club. Then there were the nouveau riche Jewish families, newer
arrivals, who ran very prosperous businesses. They were the upper middle
class, and they could join the Colonie Country Club---but not Wolfert's
Roost. And then there were the rest of us, the civil servants and
just-hanging-in-there merchants, who could not join Colonie but could
join the synagogues. Adrian and Irene joined T'Firith Israel, the
conservative synagogue. I came to know, under tragic circumstances, that
my father was an atheist, but my mother was very strongly attached to
Judaism. Marten had been pious (as well as a loyalist admirer of Emperor
Franz Joseph of Austria, who had given a medal to his second wife for
her apple strudel). My father's attachment to Judaism was political. A
mover and shaker, he became president of the synagogue and was
instrumental in transforming it into Temple Israel, which became the
largest and most powerful of the Jewish institutions in Albany.

SO YOU NOW know the world as I found it when I arrived one gestation

period after Pearl Harbor. "Just in time for lunch," were the first
words my mother heard on August 12, 1942, after the delivery at 11:58
a.m.---an exclamation we will soon hear William James make under more
momentous circumstances. I came late, and Irene was forced to walk and
walk and walk to induce labor. It must have been traumatic, because
after that I was never late again: a compulsion to get stuff done and
show up early is an emblem of my life that I am proud of. There was no
doubt that I would be named for my saintly grandfather, Marten, who had
died of a sudden heart attack in 1940. Elias was chosen as my middle
name to honor Irene's Weinstock grandfather. But all this upset my
naming-deprived six-year-old sister, who was then given naming rights.
So I acquired a second middle name, Peter. Martin Elias Peter Seligman.
Somehow the unmyelinated oblivion of childhood blanketed World War II
right up to its close, and my first memory, no less disturbing, dates
from the very end of the conflict. It was April 1945, and a blueeyed boy
with ringlets of platinum blonde hair was playing on the

linoleum floor of the kitchen. All the photos from that era---and my
father took hundreds of them---show me to be unfailingly merry and
beaming. I heard heartbroken sobs and gasps from the next room and soon
found my mother on the second step of the stairs under the newel post,
her head in her hands. I tried to comfort her but could not. She would
not stop. She sobbed and sobbed. What had happened? The
thirty-two-month-old boy was mystified, and he knew only that the person
at the center of his universe was in the throes of grief and that he was
helpless to do anything about it. Many years later, my mother explained
that she must have just heard that President Franklin Roosevelt had died
or, even worse, that she had just found out about all the Jews---much of
her family abandoned in Hungary ---murdered. Or both. I can't say for
sure if the sunshine went out of my life just then, but the photos of me
as a young child---merry and beaming---do look different from those
taken in later childhood, and they look very different still from those
of my teenage years. The smiles are a shade or two less bright after age
three, and by late childhood I am usually tight-lipped and unsmiling.
When that beaming two-year-old looks up at me from the old photos, I do
not recognize him. But I do recognize myself in the teenage photos. By
then I look serious. Considering my lifelong skirmishes with my own
depression and the fact that my early work in psychology centered on
helplessness and depression, this must have been a turning point in my
life.

I was indeed a serious student once school started. My parents first
tried nursery school when I was four, but the moment my mother left, I
wailed and did not stop until my parents retrieved me. So school was
postponed until I was five. School 16 was only two blocks from our house
on South Main Avenue. The ten-minute walk took me first for a long hug
from Milton, the crippled and basset-eyed newsboy peddling the Times
Union outside Mack's corner drug store; then past Stittigs, where the
cherry parfaits at thirty-five cents were Beth's highest reward for me;
then past the Madison Theater, where every Saturday morning Hopalong
Cassidy outgunned Peg Leg and his gang of seedy Mexicans; across Madison
Avenue under the watchful eye of the huge, merry policeman in black
leather; and onto the packed-dirt playground of the school yard, where
two hundred scruffy kids stood awaiting the rattle of the morning bell.
What awaited us on the inside of School 16 was... well, not much.
Teaching kids in the public schools of Albany was the female extension
of the O'Connell machine's hiring dozens of men to plant tulips in slow
motion in Washington Park. In addition to legions of unemployed males in
need of featherbedding, there were legions of unemployed spinsters to
pay off as well. These were my teachers. We spent countless hours
singing about Ireland. And if there is going to be a life hereafter And
somehow I am sure there's going to be I will ask my God to let me make
my heaven In that dear land across the Irish Sea. (It makes me sick even
now that my seventy-five-year-old mind is still cluttered with this junk
rather than with Shakespeare or the Gettysburg Address or even the
Bible.) Irish songs were broken by an occasional song about America. We
had dancing lessons next to the monstrous coal-blackened furnace in the
basement. Papa loves Mambo Mama loves Mambo Swings like a gate with it
He loses weight with it Uhh

We memorized times tables and practiced penmanship. "Duck and Cover,"
diving under our desks and covering our heads with our hands to survive
a Russian nuclear attack, was a fun break in the otherwise mindless
school day. Try as I might, I cannot recall a single intellectual moment
until the fourth grade. I soaked up a storehouse of knowledge through
this period---but not from going to school. I had a stamp collection
from which came unbidden the geography and political makeup of the
world. I could feel the German inflation of 1920 as I glued in the
stamps overprinted with 1 million marks and then 1 billion marks. The
dignified visage of a youthful King George VI on British colonial stamps
told me of a vast empire that stretched across the globe, an empire that
kids who went to better schools learned about from Rudyard Kipling.
Without any effort I absorbed a lot of American history from the
president series (Woodrow Wilson on the one-dollar stamp, Warren Harding
on the two-dollar stamp, and Calvin Coolidge on the five-dollar stamp).
I had a drawer full of comic books, including Classic Comics, from which
came, again unbidden, rudimentary space science, the plots of the great
novels, and countless portraits of what it is to suffer and what it is
to be a victim and what it is to have courage. "AND NOW FOR the finals.
The fourth grader who gets all of these right will be Albany's Quiz
Kid," said the announcer to the expectant audience of about two hundred
parents, teachers, and students assembled in the Madison Theater. "There
are only two of you left. Martin Seligman, you have ten seconds. What
state ends in 'ut'?" "Connecticut," I snapped back. The heroes of the
Seligman household in 1952 were not Douglas MacArthur, Dwight
Eisenhower, or even Mohandas Gandhi. Not Albert Einstein and Robert
Oppenheimer, though they were runners-up. Rather, the big names were
Joel Kupperman, Joan Alizier, and Dickie Freeman. They were Quiz Kids.
Once a week Beth and I sat in the kitchen on the edge of our chairs,
glued to this popular radio show from Chicago. Five kids, chosen for IQ,
poise, and quick wit, competed to answer listenersent-in questions.
"President Truman must fly over eight states to go to Washington from
his home in Independence, Missouri. Name five." I raced the Quiz Kids,
often winning to Beth's cheers. The Chicago

celebrities, it was announced, were chosen from local playoffs. Imagine,
Martin, that you can win a playoff in Albany and get to Chicago. The
moment actually arrived. "Connecticut is right, Martin. Now, Rocco, your
question. How many Little Peppers are there?" Rocco Giaccomino, from
somewhere in lower Albany, a place my family wouldn't even drive
through, pondered. "Five," he ventured. I was sure he was guessing. I
didn't know why, but I too would have guessed five. "Correct!" And so it
went through six more rounds. "Martin. Who wrote 'Flow Gently Sweet
Afton,' and where it is?" I'd never remotely heard of this. The Afton
must be a river. In Ireland? But not in any song we sang in School 16.
"England," I blurted out right before the bell. "Incorrect! Rocco?"
"Scotland. 'Flow Gently Sweet Afton' is a poem by Burns... Robert
Burns," said Rocco with finality. On the way out of the theater, Beth
said disconsolately, "How can they expect an eight-year-old to know
Robert Burns?" I took home a Mickey Mouse watch with a fire-engine-red
wristband. Rocco, unfairly all of nine and taught by Scottish spinsters,
went to Chicago. held in the basement of the Federal Street Synagogue.
Mrs. Mordkoff, four-foot-six, hair dyed orange-red, with disfiguring
scars on her cheeks, taught Jewish history. Neatly crayoned drawings of
ancient Jewish conquests---the sword-wielding Amalekites, the
Phoenicians tending miniature sailing ships, and the giant beskirted
Philistines fallen under Jewish spears---adorned the walls. HEBREW

The heat of the ovens of Bergen-Belsen was palpable in this basement.
Our teachers were refugees from Hitler, and they were militant Zionists.
The phrase "never again," though unspoken, was omnipresent. As in School
16, there was never an intellectual moment. We memorized the twelve
tribes of Israel---they were up there in crayon if we forgot. Manasseh
was huge and purple. We recited Hebrew we didn't understand and sang
songs in Hebrew and English. Israel, Israel lives again For the
greatness and courage Of her men... Beth interjected loudly And Women

enough Hebrew, we got promoted to memorizing Rashi, a rabbinic
commentator of the fifteenth century whose Hebrew was in a different
script, and obediently we read Rashi aloud still minus understanding. I
was reading Rashi aloud and recovering from a bug that had kept me home
the week before. The teacher, a grizzled ancient in a threadbare black
suit with a pocket watch on a silver chain, towered over me, glaring. I
read on. I came to a word I had not seen before and sounded it out:
"Yee... yaw." Lifted by the scruff of my neck into the air and tossed
out the door, I landed on the polished wooden floor outside. Much later,
I was told that I had sinned by saying the name of the Lord out loud. My
class had learned the previous week that this was forbidden. The best
moment of Hebrew school was right after it ended. Like released
prisoners, Howie Berkun, David Grand, and I shot out the double doors
and raced up to the greasy spoon at the corner of Federal and Delaware.
A deep fryer redolent of boiling pork fat dominated the tiny room. For a
quarter it produced the most delicious fries I had ever tasted. The
secret was smearing them with catsup and salt and eating the potatoes
immediately out of the fryer. Adrian, elected president of the
synagogue, had sold the old building to the Jehovah's Witnesses (as a
child I hadn't the foggiest idea what they were) and merged the
congregation with one of the other conservative congregations; he was
now running for president of the newly minted Temple Israel. The
internecine rivalries were fierce, and dinner conversation was all about
what a "dope" Kibby Koblenz, his opponent, was and how Adrian's young
handler, Leo Pfaff, was bringing the Lorvans around. My bar mitzvah was
scheduled for October 1955 in the spanking new building. But my little
world was about to be turned upside down. IF WE MEMORIZED

Youth (1955--1960)

Taller, I walk through the shrunken corridors On the cross of whose
walls I was nailed My gelatinous mind impaled My gelatinous heart
jelled1

BY AGE TWELVE, I was brainy. Teachers liked me. Miss Eldred in the
fourth grade was the first to dote on me and to tell me that I was
unusually bright. Beth and my parents said so, but Miss Eldred was more
credible, since she penciled my report card and therefore was harder to
discount. I was fast and confident in class---if not on the street or
the Little League diamond---and liked to show off my smarts. I had my
hand in the air before almost all my classmates---except Gary Hoke, who
mercifully decamped to Cleveland midyear. Facts stuck to me, and
learning was effortless. When it did demand effort---like plowing
through a whole book---I didn't do it. I bluffed my way through the long
stuff. I strongly identified as Jewish. You (and I) should find this
noteworthy, even provocative, given the dark stories I've just narrated
and the absence of any positive memories that come to mind. But
tribalism is surely not about the good times, and it penetrated to my
soul. When I scanned the front page of the Knickerbocker News, as I did
every evening after reading Alley Oop, the J-word just popped off the
page. I was part of a minority and a persecuted one at that. It was
dangerous to be Jewish. They might descend on us in the middle of the
night and cart us off to the gas chambers. I was chicken-shit Jewish,
not proud Jewish like my Hebrew school teachers. Most of our neighbors
were Catholic,

and they were also tribal. But they were not hostile, and we were
tolerated, at least to our faces. I was never called a dirty Jew, but
this did not weaken my lurking paranoia. At Christmas, Easter, and
especially on Sunday, the difference between the Seligmans and the
Campbells and Buccis was stark. My parents almost never socialized with
the goyim, and unlike our Reform Jewish friends, we didn't have a
Hanukkah bush. Lastly, I was déclassé. I was soon to find out what this
meant. MY FATHER DROPPED me

off at the bottom of the circular, elm-lined driveway of a stately
Georgian edifice surrounded by a greensward of tennis courts and
football fields. I was not allowed to walk up the white marble steps and
go in by the front door. Rather I was ushered around the side and into
the "buttery," a cavernous, low-ceilinged, wood-paneled affair. I sat on
one of the long benches set at a gleaming hardwood table. There were
about fifty boys of my age so seated, and on the hour we were each
presented with a booklet, a pencil, and blank answer sheet. This was the
entrance competition for admission to the Albany Academy for Boys. It
was (I now know) just an IQ test. No need to bluff here. I breezed
through it and finished minutes before any other boy. Weeks later my
parents told me that I would be attending the academy in the fall of
1955 for second form (the British public school term for eighth grade).
My father was very proud. He and Irene had decided to make a big
sacrifice for my future. Adrian, as deputy state reporter of the Court
of Appeals, earned less than \$7,500 before taxes, and the tuition they
shouldered was \$600 plus uniforms, lunches, bussing, and fees. Why this
sacrifice? Not only did the teachers at School 16 not teach anything,
but college admissions officers had sniffed this out. Even the
valedictorian from Albany High School must have struggled to get into
Cornell---the zenith of aspiration for students of the Albany public
schools. Harvard, Yale, and Princeton were out of reach. Beth had been
admitted to Radcliffe, but my parents would not pay for a girl to be so
expensively educated. So she went to the University of Rochester for
just one year and then to the free New York State Teacher's College in
Albany. The best graduates of the Albany Academy for Boys, however,
sometimes got into the great universities, and my assigned role was to
burst the chains that had shackled the family since Marten's rejection
by the Viennese Academy of Fine Arts, Big Brother Bert's Millions, the

Great Depression, and the gray civil service. I was told none of this of
course, not even about Radcliffe. IT IS 1998. Darryl, my son, is four
years old. I am fifty-four years old. My

wife Mandy and I tell Darryl that he has to have exploratory surgery, a
colonic biopsy. He is scared and bewildered. He goes out the kitchen
door and sits on a low wall. Over and over he drops polished stones one
at a time into his hand, empties his hand, and does it again. And again.
After an hour he comes back in. "I'm ready," he says, and lightning arcs
across the generations. IT WAS THE last day of August 1955. I was scared
and bewildered. I would

be bussed to a new school, a military school, all boys, uniforms, a
battalion, rich kids, and only male teachers. I didn't know a single
person. I would be kept there every day until 5 p.m. My bar mitzvah was
in two months. My very body was erupting: a four-inch black hair had
sprouted in my groin. In the gray drizzle, I took foul shots over and
over for two hours. With every clunk of the basketball against the
backboard, the haze of childhood dropped away. "I am ready," I said out
loud. I TOOK THE same walk as before, but now I stopped at the corner of

Madison and Allen and waited for the school bus. I was in uniform, my
black knit sweater tucked neatly into the heavy gray woolen trousers. An
older boy in uniform waited on the corner. "Hi, I'm Jerry Spector," he
said, "and your sweater is on wrong. It isn't supposed to be tucked in."
Blushing self-consciously, I pulled my sweater out of my trousers.
Before the bus could arrive, a huge, befinned Cadillac pulled over, and
we were offered a ride. Jerry got in. Sheepishly I slinked in behind
him. The driver was Mr. Titus, and his son, David, in the front seat,
was, like Jerry, a fourth former.

The Albany Academy for Boys. In the spring of 1955 my father dropped me
off at the bottom of the circular, elm-lined driveway of a stately
Georgian edifice. Here are the stairs I was not allowed to walk up until
my senior year. Photo from Cue, 1960 yearbook.

As we alighted in the circular driveway, Jerry whispered to me,

"Wow. Their older son was the major of battalion, the pinnacle position
in the student body, last year. The major---John Abel Titus, and
Mr. Titus is 'Mr. Major-maker.'" Jerry said this reverently. "WHAT IS
THE story of the Hayes-Tilden election of 1876?" Mr. Steck

asked in a sharp midwestern twang. It was second-form American history,
a continuation of first-form American history, which must have left off
with Ulysses Grant. My hand shot up. Puzzled, Mr. Steck called on me. I
narrated the electoral vote tie and then the sellout to the southern
forces in the House of Representatives. As I talked, Mr. Steck's face
got redder and redder. He cut me off at the word "Reconstruction." I had
answered a rhetorical question. I was told to stay after class and wrote
"soybeans are better" one hundred times, covering three blackboards
before he dismissed me. The day ended on the football field. To my
surprise I recognized the coach, Bob Olcott. Burly Bob had been the
amiable swimming instructor at the Stratton Mountain Boy Scout camp the
previous summer. He had failed me on my swimming merit badge for doing a
scissors kick, rather than a frog kick, with my breast stroke. Duly
corrected, I finally got the badge. "Hello, Bob," I said. His jaw
dropped. There was a stunned silence from the football kids within
hearing range. "It is 'Mr. Olcott,' and it is 'Sir,'" he said. Not a
perfect start to my five years at the Albany Academy for Boys. I made
some friends in the first two weeks: red-headed Charlie Witherell, who
sat noisily behind me in first-year Latin, whose older brother, Warren,
was a renowned water-skier; and Charles Lansing Pruyn Townsend, star
athlete who bounded like a mountain goat down the marble steps three at
a time. The very same name was also up on the mahogany Class of 1927
plaque listing the majors for the last 140 years. In that case it was
Charlie's father's name, and Charles senior was now the PMS&T, or
professor of military science and tactics. I never discovered what that
meant that he did. One boy had been unaccountably absent for the first
two weeks and was whispered about in tones of awe. He was a star
student, a poet, and the fullback. His father, Sidney, owned swaths of
downtown Albany and Troy. (A decade later William Kennedy would defame
Sidney on the front page of the Times Union as a "slumlord.")

Sight unseen, I was starstruck. The young man finally appeared. He had
been on a family vacation. Strikingly handsome, a shock of red-brown
hair combed insouciantly over his left eye, more mature than his
prepubescent classmates, and quietly aloof, he exuded mystery. If the
second form could be said to have a god, it was Jeffrey Albert. With
more than a touch of hero worship, I focused on befriending Jeff. He and
I had in common "pre-intellectualism," a better trait than
pseudo-intellectualism, but not much better. We asked profound questions
(two years too soon to be sophomoric) about God, truth, meaning, and
death, and we looked down on those boys who were not as profound. Jeff
and I did not, however, have in common spending money, popularity,
athleticism, tailored uniforms, good looks, and a gaggle of lovelorn
second formers from the Albany Academy for Girls. Jeff had all of these.
Jeff lived in a mansion at the bottom of Marion Avenue, the place to
live. My parents had walked me to that part of Albany on Sunday strolls,
imagining the lives of the other half. I was invited for dinner. The
Alberts had a live-in Negro maid--- Eppsie---and she served us each a
whole guinea hen with raisins. We sipped a French wine. Beatrice Albert
presided. She was gaunt and deeply bronzed, her lustrous black hair was
regally coiffed, and she spoke with a southern accent. She used words
like "trepidation." The conversation was about golf at the Colonie
Country Club and the doings of the Barnets and the Sterns, the old
Jewish families of Albany. I did not yet know the term "nouveau riche"
or even have an inkling of the concept. There were bowls of fresh fruit
in the basement, a pool table, a pingpong table, and a pinball machine.
Beatrice, who unbeknownst to me had clawed her way up from southern
poverty to marry the richest lawyer in Albany, immediately sensed my
true social standing and almost by telepathy communicated it to me. I
blushed violently and found myself saying "social climber" over and over
to myself about myself. IT IS A perfect spring day in late May 2013.
Acres of tulips are out in

Washington Park. It is the day of the two hundredth anniversary of the
founding of the Albany Academy. I receive the distinguished alumni award
and am invited to give a speech. The academy's headmaster

introduces me as its "most important graduate since Herman Melville."
Puffed up, I decide to take a memory jaunt around Albany. I walk three
miles all the way to Jeffrey's house. There is a new wing jutting from
its west end. I stare up at the vast pile. I want to ring the doorbell
and tell Mrs. Albert about Herman Melville and me. I stand transfixed
for a full minute. I tremble violently and then slink away. Beatrice
Albert haunts me all the days of my life. MY BAR MITZVAH was an unusual
double event, with Gerry Shay and me

having to share the spotlight. The Kibby Koblenz wing had wrested
control of the synagogue from my father and vengefully slighted the son
of the outgoing president of Temple Israel to deliver their message.
Decades later my sister told me that Adrian's name was not even on the
plaque memorializing the past presidents of Temple Israel. I was told
none of this, but I could sense my father's frustration and
helplessness... and something even worse, something that felt like a
boil about to burst. The reception was a meeting of oil and water.
Enthusiastic but clueless, I had invited my old friends from School 16
and from the Boy Scouts and my new friends from the Albany Academy: Jews
and nonJews, rich and poor, the old gentry and the newly arrived, the
tailored and the shabby. The girls also came from all these strata.
Except for the mysterious magnetism by which the pretty girls attracted
an adventurous boy or two across the invisible boundary, the worlds
didn't mingle. They rarely jitterbugged together and never slow-danced
together. It was an awkward afternoon and exposed for all the Academy
boys and girls to see what Beatrice Albert instantly recognized: Martin
did not belong. My mother asked me that evening if I would be continuing
my Jewish education. I emphatically told her that this was my last day
in a synagogue and that I did not believe in God. Late that night I
heard her sobbing softly in the next bedroom. MY FATHER HAD arrived at a
turning point in 1955. Young newlyweds of

the Great Depression, he and Irene had chosen the safe life: civil
service and a guarantee of lifetime employment. They watched in surprise
as the economy boomed after World War II and into the 1950s. No
depression returned. Their peers---whom they often called
"dopes"---turned out not to be so dopey. Many of them were becoming
really prosperous, leaving

my family in the dust. At least the civil service promised advancement
for talented lawyers, and my father was talented. Irene told me that he
was fast, so fast that he could do in one hour what other lawyers took a
full day to do, and so he had seven extra hours to make his work
perfect. He was forty-nine years-old, and the next big job opened up:
state reporter of the Court of Appeals. The job after that might even be
justice of the Court of Appeals. Blue skies. Adrian was a shoo-in. No
one else was nearly as talented. Shortly after my bar mitzvah, he came
home in the middle of the day, close to tears. He had not reckoned on
Irish politics. James Flavin, a favorite of the O'Connell machine, was
promoted over him. Just as he had as a child, Adrian went into hiding.
He stayed home for weeks with a cold. But he emerged from this dark
night of helplessness with a big plan. He would run for office, and not
just any office---for the second-highest office in New York State:
comptroller. He was a natural politician. I had watched him work the
beach in Lake Luzerne. He often approached strangers, asked them
questions that he knew the answers to, and so got them talking about
themselves. After fifteen minutes he had a new friend. He approached all
these friends for campaign money and began to build a war chest. He
angered easily now and was feverish with activity. I HAD BEEN doing very
well academically. An A was a rare grade at my

school, and I was getting lots of them---even in Mr. Steck's American
history class. Mr. Santee, the second-form English teacher, was
underwhelmed, however. He kept me after class for talking out loud
without raising my hand and had me write a spontaneous one-page essay on
John Buchan's racist novel Prester John. I handed it in confidently
after ten minutes---like my father, I was a fast worker. Mr. Santee was
delighted: I had fallen into his trap. He warned expectantly, "Unless
every i is dotted and every t is crossed, Seligman, you fail for the
period." Each i was dotted, and each t was crossed. Mr. Santee was
visibly annoyed. But I was not doing well socially. I manned up and
asked Mary Ellen Fisher on a date to the movies. It seemed to go well,
and her mother told my mother that I was a "perfect gentleman." Mary
Ellen threw a big party a month later for the whole "crowd," the big
social event of the fall. I was pointedly not invited. Except for what
was soon to befall me,

this was the worst thing I experienced in second form. I was also not
doing well with the boys. I loved food. Lunch in the buttery---white
bread with browned chicken gravy---was a blissful break in the
eight-to-five Academy day. When I am happy eating, I hum. It was a
fiercely cold winter lunchtime. I was happily eating and noticed that
the entire room had fallen silent. I looked around. Everyone was staring
at me and listening to my humming. The older boys were beside themselves
with laughter. I turned beet red. I wanted to die. There was one other
new boy in second form who shared my status: half Jewish, no money,
brainy, not an athlete, nomadic, with a civil servant father. His name
was Robert Kaiser. His father was an aide to the governor. Bob and I let
down our guard with each other, and we spent weekends comfortably
together. Governor Harriman, broomstick stiff and overly meticulous of
speech, came to dinner at their house, and he was the first dignitary I
ever met. Mr. Kaiser actually called him "Averill." The Kaisers had a
drafty weather-beaten farmhouse in Guilderland with a large empty
pasture. Bob and I scraped together fifty dollars and bought a green
1948 Ford. We were both just thirteen, but you did not need a license to
drive on private property. We mowed an oval track into the pasture, and
Bob's mother showed us how to work the balky stick shift. She made us
wear our football helmets. We spent heavenly afternoons racing at top
speed around our little track. We went to the drag races on Saturday
nights. One perfect May Saturday, Adrian drove Bob and me in our
family's 1950 black Chevrolet to the golf course. As he departed, Adrian
remarked casually that he couldn't feel his left arm. I caught his
nervous chuckle and worried all through the afternoon. But when he
picked us up, after an afternoon of campaigning, he seemed fine. He went
to see Dr. Drapkin, the doctor around the corner. Adrian's blood
pressure was sky-high: 300/180! Dr. Drapkin dismissed him with the
advice "Take it easy." An effective antihypertensive drug, warfarin, had
recently come on the market, but this life-saving knowledge had not yet
made its way up the Hudson River to the general practitioners of Albany.
The next Friday I overnighted after school at Jeffrey's house. I walked
home in the morning, and as I rounded the corner of South Main and
Madison Avenue, I saw flashing red lights in front of our house. I

raced down the block to see my father being wheeled on a gurney into an
ambulance. I could hear him speaking, but I couldn't make out the words.
It was apparently an attempt at humor since the paramedic feigned a
laugh. They drove off at top speed, siren blaring. Adrian had a stroke,
a cerebral thrombosis. It was serious but not life threatening. I was
afraid, actually petrified, to visit the hospital. I couldn't bear to
see him so struck down. His big brother, Bert, rushed up from Manhattan
and visited for two hours. Irene heard a loud argument from inside the
hospital room. Bert exploded out the door and left. Irene rushed in.
Adrian was unconscious. He had suffered another stroke, this one massive
and irreversible. We never found out what Adrian and Bert had argued
about. When Adrian woke, he was paralyzed on his left side and not
expected to live. Against the odds, he survived and spent the next two
weeks in Albany Hospital. Then he was transferred to a nursing home in
Guilderland, where he spent the next two months without improvement. I
finally steeled myself for a visit. I could see in a glance that he had
lost twenty pounds, and his left arm and left leg were withered and
motionless. He was overcome with tears when he saw me. His speech was
unimpeded, and except for being more emotional than before, he seemed
quite lucid. At the end of the visit, he told us in a choking sob, "I
don't believe in God. The only thing I believe in is you---Irene,
Martin, and Beth---and I don't want to die." Adrian never recovered. By
the end of the summer he was sent home, still paralyzed, still
emotionally labile, and wholly drained of his hallmark vitality. "HI
THERE. SORRY to bother you, but I've been talking to all the folks here
in Greenwich \[pronounced 'green witch,' not to be confused with the
posh suburb in Connecticut\], making a sort of survey. I'm not here to
sell you anything," I lied. Bob Kaiser had seen an ad in the
Knickerbocker News from the Keystone Readers Service offering to hire
boys as young as thirteen. We needed the money. Irene had called a
family council. She told us that the nursing home costs had wiped out
almost all our savings and all their insurance, and now Adrian would
need round-the-clock nursing care when he came home. Beth all too
eagerly suggested that I return to

public school, saving almost \$1,000, and Irene very reluctantly agreed.
A year ago I would have burst into tears, but now I was a man, and the
man of the house, so I quietly decided to go looking for a job with Bob.
Bob and I appeared for the interview on the fifth floor of a rundown
office building in lower Albany. There was no interview. All the boys
who showed up were hired on the spot. There was no salary, only a
commission, four dollars on the thirty-six-dollar deal. Those few boys
who didn't quit the first week would be the summer sales force. We were
door-to-door magazine salesmen. The customer got four three-year
subscriptions to Curtis Publishing House magazines. Five boys were
packed into each car and driven to hamlets all over upstate New York. We
avoided rich places (residents were too smart not to realize that
thirty-six dollars is no bargain, since they would pay exactly that if
they wrote in for subscriptions), and we avoided poor places (where
people didn't have the two-dollar down payment). We met hundreds---and
in my case thousands---of young housewives from poor working families.
"Would you mind telling me which three of these \[I tried to hand her a
laminated card with a list of magazines---Ladies Home Journal, Better
Homes and Gardens, Field and Stream, Jack and Jill\] are your
favorites?" If she opened the screen door and took the card, I was
halfway home. If she did not---saying, "Books! We don't want any!"---I
reassured her that I was not there to sell anything; I was just taking a
sort of survey. Forty years later, New York's state legislature would
outlaw this as a deceptive sales practice, but in June 1956 it was
legal. Bob Kaiser quit in disgust after the first week. I, however, had
made forty sales and was handed eight twenty-dollar bills, \$160---more
than my father, with a doctorate in jurisprudence, took home from the
Court of Appeals. I did this for five summers, and by the time I was
ready to graduate and had a driver's license, I had my own crew of young
boys. I made more money selling magazines than I would make again until
I was an associate professor. When I was seventeen, Mr. Hunter, the
owner, told each boy on the way out the door, "Touch the lucky stones."
Some of them obeyed reluctantly, but I recoiled at this mysterious
sexual overture. He did not ask me again---but he did offer me the whole
company in the summer of 1960 if I gave up my college dream. When the
Academy reopened in late September 1956, Headmaster Harry E. P. Meislahn
called me into his office and told me that he was giving me a full
scholarship. Beth and my friend Jerry Spector had been

to see him to tell him I would have to withdraw because we were too
poor. I had to wash dishes at lunchtime, but between that and my
magazine sales, I was saved. Henceforward, adopting my headmaster's
double middle initials, I would be Martin E. P. Seligman. I was now a
third former. I stood first in my class of fifty academically. But I was
not brimming with confidence; quite the opposite: my father's
helplessness had affected me in ways I could not begin to fathom. I was
ambitious to achieve the heights at the Academy, to become a major or at
least a captain, and I was elected class president ---the last
presidency I would hold until I won that of the American Psychological
Association. About eight of the third formers were promoted to private
first-class---the very rich boys, Mr. Meislahn's son, Findlay, and
Charles Lansing Pruyn Townsend, the winner of competitive drill. I
remained a private. Bob Kaiser decamped for the Loomis School in
Connecticut. His parents were in better touch with the real old-boy
system than were the more provincial Albany parents. After Yale, Bob
would be a journalist and historian, then famously the managing editor
of the Washington Post under Ben Bradlee. He never had to sell another
magazine. Dan Chirot took Bob's place. Dan was the most exotic kid in
school. He was French, his blonde hair was wildly uncombed, and he spoke
with just a trace of an accent. Despite being very middle-class---his
father was an anesthesiologist in Troy---Dan was supercilious. Somehow,
I felt honored when he deigned to chat with me. Even Beatrice Albert was
taken in. When Dan and I arrived for dinner together at the Marion
Avenue mansion, Mrs. Albert brightened visibly and hugged him.
Mr. Albert asked Dan (who was just fourteen) to sip and then approve the
red Bordeaux. "Quite potable," he said. I was chopped liver. And Dan was
superbright. The highest grade at the Academy was an A. Dan took French,
and suddenly an A+ was publicly awarded. By the middle of fourth form,
Dan did something no one else had ever done in the Academy's 140 years:
a headline in the Fish and Pumpkin announced that Daniel Chirot had
gotten all A+s. I was being bettered, but not to be wholly outdone, I
soon became the second boy to achieve this. He joined Jeff and me as the
class "intellectuals." He was

sophisticated. He read Le Monde and told us it had footnotes. He read
Doctor Zhivago when it first came out. He talked about Napoleon's exiles
and about French socialism. Dan and I played chess every day, since we
were excused from study hall because of our grades and, as nerds, didn't
play football. Dan read chess columns. I played a bold and unlettered
game. He usually beat me. IT WAS THE first day of fourth form, and the
battalion promotions were

posted. I raced down the white marble steps to the basement bulletin
board. Half the class would be promoted to corporal, the must-have next
step on the way to leadership at the Academy. My promotion was a near
certainty: president of the class and a close second in the class
academically. I scanned the corporal list: Sangster... Siebert...
Townsend... VanDerZee. No Seligman. Surely this was a mistake. It was
not. I was promoted to private first-class on the list below. Dan Chirot
remained a private... in his case proudly so. As for me, this was
perhaps the most disappointing day of my life. I was heartbroken.
THIRTY-FIVE YEARS LATER, I attend an alumni event at the Union League in

downtown Philadelphia. The speakers are Mr. Steck and Mr. Olcott, both
legendary Academy coaches, both now almost eighty. I invite them to
overnight at our spacious home on the Mainline, and both accept
enthusiastically. The next morning, while Bob Olcott sleeps in, Ernie
Steck and I have breakfast. "You may have wondered, Marty," begins
Ernie, "why you were not promoted to corporal in the fourth form."

I am taken aback. How could he know about the trauma I have kept so
secret? "Actually it really hurt and has baffled me all these years," I
confide to Ernie. "You probably have no idea how anti-Semitic the
Academy was in the 1950s. I arrived, as a newly minted teacher from
Iowa, three years before you did. The Santees had us over to dinner, and
Harold \[who later became headmaster\] asked me where I went to church.
I told him I sometimes attended the Reform Synagogue. Harold left the
table and did not reappear that evening. That is also, by the way,
Marty, why you were rejected by Harvard." It had never---not even
once---occurred to me that Mr. Steck was Jewish. JEANNIE ALBRIGHT,
Barbara Willis, and Sally Eckert were the it girls and

the unattainable romantic interests of this chubby fourth former. What
could I possibly do to interest spit-curled, ski-sloped-nosed Jeannie,
or full-breasted Barbara, the voluptuous fount of pubescent gossip, or,
most impossibly, winter-tanned Sally? Jeff, who had already cornered
Jeannie, was almost every girl's dream come true. Tony VanDerZee, though
slowwitted, was from a family that had reigned in Albany for three
centuries.

Barbara already had her cap set at Charlie Townsend, or if that failed,
at Tony as runner-up. Sally was the princess of the Catholic girls. She
would marry the major of the battalion of the Class of 1959. Jonathon
Gordon---handsome, confident, and the likely major from our Class of
1960---it was rumored, had already gotten laid. How could I even get to
first base? I could talk to them about their troubles. What a brilliant
stroke! I was willing to bet no other guy ever listened to them ruminate
about their insecurities, nightmares, and bleakest fantasies. I tried on
the role, spending three hours a night on the phone listening to Sally
or Jeannie or Barbara. I did not score or even come close, but I
snuggled comfortably into my new niche---these were the baby steps to
becoming the psychologist I would be. In sixth form Mr. Charles Colton
helped me take my first real steps. He had taught me Caesar in third
form. One day I came in unprepared. When he called on me, I glided my
way through a passage on Germania. "You're bluffing, Seligman," he
interrupted. "Zero." This was the only failing grade I ever got. I was
never unprepared again, and except in poker, I never bluffed again. Not
ever. Three years later, Mr. Colton did me a momentous favor. He
invented a new course called "The Humanities." I had no idea what that
was, but Jeff, Dan, and I and all the other cum laude boys took it. Paul
Monaco was not one of the cum laude boys. He was the quiet, unassuming
one. We shared a deep bond. His father, a daring star columnist for the
Times Union, dropped dead at about the same time as Adrian had his
strokes. Paul turned out to be the most loyal of my friends, and he,
like me, had his life changed by his first encounter with the
humanities. We read Will Durant on religion and philosophy. We listened
to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. We read Dylan Thomas, lots of dark Dylan,
as you can see from the poem at the beginning of this chapter. An
unbounded new world opened. There was a life of the mind, and it was
different from getting A+s and being a snobby intellectual. It was where
I wanted to spend the rest of my life. Graduation was a glum affair for
me. Dan was valedictorian of our class---although fifty years later, my
friend Doug North, valedictorian of 1958 and the new headmaster, sent me
an official transcript stating that I had actually graduated first in
the class. I did not receive the various academic prizes that I felt I
had earned. Instead they were distributed to the boys whose families
were most likely to support the Academy

financially in future years. I felt more a failure than a triumphant
graduate sallying forth to conquer new worlds. I was going to Princeton,
and that should have been cause for celebration, but so were four of my
classmates, and I was, after all, a Harvard reject. Beth and Irene
hosted a lifeless party for me in the backyard with tables set up around
our sour cherry tree. My cousins, aunts, and uncles were all there, but
I was a zombie going through the motions. I did not belong to their
underclass world any longer. My father was conspicuous, hobbled and
unable to control his emotions, both positive and negative. He was
proud. He had achieved what he sacrificed for, and I was no longer the
poor Jewish boy I had been before the Academy.

Chapter Four

Miseducation (1960--1964)

AT EIGHTEEN, I was still brainy, but now I was in the big leagues, at
Princeton University, and I had no idea how brainy I was relative to the
amazing other freshmen I met: National Merit Scholars, winners of
national science competitions, math and physics geniuses already
publishing, even speed readers. I asked Bob Darling, later my roommate,
how long it took him to read Thomas Mann's dense Tonio Kruger. He said,
"About three minutes." It took me five hours. I was no longer Jewish,
but I was still very much lower caste, although I didn't know exactly
which variety of low. As I walked down Prospect Street past the Ivy
Club, which had a larger endowment than the University of Pennsylvania,
I knew that I would never walk up the path to its doors. Princeton's
social strata made Albany's seem scalable. I desperately needed to avoid
this nasty, inaccessible part of Princeton, but I couldn't imagine how.
I was depressive, and I was a pessimist. I toyed with writing about
death and dying, and I wore black much of the time. I was morbidly
introspective and through freshman year kept a handwritten journal full
of dark thoughts. I was ambitious and hungry. I wanted Mrs. Albert to
know my name. I was an intellectual, and I was at home in the life of
the mind. My caste problem and my craving for the life of the mind were
addressed in one fell swoop. Darwin Labarthe was president of the Class
of 1961, that year's senior class. I never personally met him as an
undergraduate, but he was my hero. On our first day as freshmen, we
assembled in the ornate Victorian Alexander Hall. Darwin told us in his
crisp staccato about the honor code---either giving or receiving aid on
an examination automatically led to expulsion and the extirpation of
one's name from all

records---and about what was expected of us: Princeton in the nation's
service. It was a stirring speech, but Darwin was much more than a
speech maker. The year of "dirty bicker," 1958, was a bad one for
Princeton's reputation. Bicker was Princeton's equivalent of fraternity
"rush." A week of interviewing sophomores culminated in their admission
to one of the fifteen Prospect Street eating clubs, which were the
centers of social life for upperclassmen. The clubs were selective, and
every year some unfortunate sophomores were "hosed," rejected by all the
clubs. There was a gentlemen's agreement that these losers would be
absorbed into the fold, one per club. In 1958 twenty-three sophomores
were hosed, mostly Jewish and mostly National Merit Scholars. No club
was willing to absorb them, and Princeton's anti-intellectualism and
racism made headlines the world over. Attempts to work around the clubs
had a long and bitter history for Princeton's presidents. Woodrow Wilson
tried to abolish them, and the trustees asked him to resign for this
heresy. He exited to the lesser posts of the New Jersey governorship and
the American presidency, harboring deep animosity toward his Princeton
foes until his death. Darwin approached Robert Goheen, the very young
new president of Princeton. In 1957, in a single electrifying hour,
Goheen had been promoted from lowly assistant professor of Greek and
Latin to associate professor with tenure to full professor and then to
president. It would be his job to drag the southern gentleman's resort
that was Princeton belatedly into the twentieth century of civil rights
for black people. His encounter with Darwin was defining. Darwin asked
him to underwrite a rival system to the clubs---a nonselective eating
facility that would become an epicenter of undergraduate intellectual
life. President Goheen, knowing well Woodrow Wilson's fate, at first
demurred. But the persistent Darwin brought the valedictorian and the
celebrated Princeton Tiger mascot into President Goheen's office to
lobby and threatened a public walkout from the club system. President
Goheen saw the wisdom of the idea and grasped it with both hands. The
new "alternate facility" was duly named after Woodrow Wilson. Wilson
Lodge was flooded with takers, not just the most intellectually serious
of the undergraduates but many distinguished faculty as well. And it
solved both my problems. I joined in my sophomore year and found myself
surrounded by people just like me. We engaged every

evening in some of the most stimulating discussions of my life. About
fifty faculty, including President Goheen himself, Walter Kaufman, Hans
Aarsleff, James Ward Smith, Sam Glucksberg, Julian Jaynes, Malcolm
Diamond, John Wheeler, Bruce Goldberg, Richard Rorty, and Robert Nozick,
could be found there every evening, dining with rapt undergraduates. I
have spent much of my academic life trying to replicate those
evenings---since they are the very essence of what a university is
about. IN 2010 I go with my sixteen-year-old son Darryl on the campus
tour of

Princeton. Wilson Lodge and its descendants---the "college system"---
have grown and flourished to such an extent that the tour guide, as we
walk down Prospect Street, calls the eating clubs the "alternate
facility." I write President Goheen an admiring letter saying that he
succeeded where Woodrow Wilson failed. In one of his last letters before
his death, Robert Goheen agrees. I treasure his handwritten letter. THE
GRANDEUR AND grandiosity of Freud's vision stayed with me all

through high school and into my first year at Princeton University. I
took no psychology courses early in my undergraduate days but rather
immersed myself in the life of the philosophy department. I avoided
psychology courses because the sophisticated upperclassmen called them
"guts"---populated by the jocks and gentleman's C students---and at
Princeton in the early 1960s, the psychology department was
undistinguished, utterly without gods. On the other hand, the philosophy
department was chock-full of great men. Of the greats, the one who
became my friend was Robert Nozick. He was a mere graduate student at
the time, only four years older than I, but his unique brilliance was
obvious even then. He paced up and down in his baggy brown
suit---graduate students wore academic robes at dinner but suits in
class---and told us freshmen that Descartes was wrong and that Aristotle
could be greatly improved upon. This was nothing short of astonishing.
Philosophy was alive, something one can do rather than just study. Bob
went on to become one of the preeminent philosophers of the twentieth
century, with a range of philosophical contributions from the
foundations of logic to happiness to liberty and ethics and everything
in between. At the Harvard memorial service for Bob (he died of
intestinal cancer in 2002 at age sixty-three), his son said, "Some boys
brag about

their fathers, saying he was the strongest man in the world, or the
handsomest man in the world. Well, my father was the smartest man in the
world." Many of us could only nod agreement. In the mother's milk of
meeting the first world-class intellects that I had ever known, I also
imbibed their unspoken premises. There were two. The first premise in
the Princeton philosophy department was rigor. It was not enough to know
what was true; you had to be entitled to know what was true by the
rigorous and compelling argument that got you there. Poor Freud. His
work was rich with insight, and the landscape of his vision was almost
boundless. His intuition leapt from mountaintop to mountaintop, but the
valleys were too shrouded in mist to make out clearly. Rigor? This Freud
did not have, as emblematized by his nomination for the Nobel Prize in
literature, not medicine. Was there some way, I wondered, to answer the
great questions that Freud investigated with the rigor so prized by my
mentors? In psychology, as in many disciplines, the degree of rigor and
the importance of a problem are all too often reciprocal. This dilemma
goes under the name "internal versus external validity," or, without the
jargon, "rigor versus reality." The more the method captures the
real-world issue (external validity), the less rigor (internal validity)
it has. Conversely the more rigor the method has, the more poorly it
captures the real world. How unfortunate. This is the "white rats and
college sophomore" issue: researchers can control and measure what rats
and sophomores do in the laboratory, but any finding's application to
real human problems is always a strain. Are stomach ulcers in the rat
exposed to unpredictable electric shocks really the same thing as
duodenal ulcers in a woman who has lost her job? Freud was aware of this
dilemma, and the story attributed to him---a man looks under a
streetlight, where the light is better, for a watch he has dropped
elsewhere---is about just this. It tells us where Freud stood on the
importance of external validity over rigor. Freud believed that the
possibility of a revolutionary insight could justify going way beyond
the evidence. In direct contrast, the behaviorists---militantly---looked
where the light was good, even at the cost of not finding their lost
watches. The behaviorists are the direct descendants of what I call
"atomism."

more insidious premise slipped into the mother's milk of my Princeton
education---is the thesis that real understanding comes only by working
from the ground up. We can gain clarity about real-world issues only if
we first discover and analyze the simple building blocks of the complex
real world and then reassemble them to reconstruct reality. The model is
the periodic table of the elements. Chemistry was a muddle until the
relationship among elements was first understood and codified in the
periodic table. Only then could molecules be understood and could
chemistry take off. Philosophical atomism began at the turn of the last
century with the work of Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein and
had its full flowering in logical positivism and behaviorism. Russell
and Alfred North Whitehead1 showed that arithmetic, which seemed sloppy
to them, could be derived from just a few premises of logic and thus
placed on much firmer ground. Only on such firm ground could indubitable
truth rest. In his Tractatus logico-philosophicus,2 Wittgenstein took
this much further. To understand reality, he argued, one must discover
its "logical atoms" and how they combine. Absent such bedrock, alleged
understanding is just confusion. This idea is famously distilled in the
Wagnerian close of the Tractatus: ATOMISM---THE SECOND AND

Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, so muss man schweigen. Whereof one cannot
speak, so must one consign to silence. Matters of good and evil, of
beauty, of politics, of science, of religion, in Wittgenstein's view,
lacked the bedrock and could not be rigorously and thoroughly
understood. It is commonly thought that Wittgenstein was drawing the
boundaries of the island of what could be known. A more romantic
interpretation offered by one of the many followers who fell in love
with him is that Wittgenstein was "drawing the boundaries of the ocean."
A cruder interpretation is that of logical positivism, which transmuted
the closing epigram of the Tractatus into the "verification principle":
only statements that can be verified empirically (or are tautologies)
are meaningful. Logical positivism enjoyed its moment in the sun in the
1950s but fell out of fashion because, among other problems, it could
not be applied to itself: the verification principle is itself neither a
tautology nor verifiable.

When applied to what philosophy should work on, atomism urges that
before real-world problems---ethics, science, politics, morality,
beauty, happiness, and the like---can be tackled, the basic
philosophical confusions about language, knowledge, and the mind must be
sorted out. This issue formed the nub of the dramatic story of
Wittgenstein's poker.3 In 1946, in the shadow of the Holocaust, Karl
Popper rebuked the members of the Moral Philosophy Club in Cambridge,
the very den that Ludwig Wittgenstein and his besotted lion cubs
inhabited. Wittgenstein was by then the leading "analytic" philosopher
in the world, and his cubs were fierce in their devotion to him. Popper
contended that there were real problems in the world, and it was the job
of philosophy to tackle them. Wittgenstein, he contended, had suborned
an entire generation of philosophers by seducing them into working on
the preliminaries to the preliminaries---puzzles rather than problems.
Wittgenstein reacted by brandishing a fireplace poker at Popper and then
walked out, slamming the door. Most of my teachers at Princeton worked
in the deep shadow of Wittgenstein, and the careful, logical analysis of
puzzles was the work given to good students there. The iconoclasts, like
Professor Walter Kaufman, who worked on atheism and morality, and
Professor Arthur Szathmary, who worked on beauty, were ostracized. Bob
Nozick survived because he played the analytic game as well as anyone.
But as we shall see, it was not the only game he played superbly.

Robert Nozick, pictured here as a second-year graduate student at
Princeton, was in 1961 my first teacher in philosophy. He went on to
become one of the world's preeminent philosophers and played a major
role in the founding of positive psychology thirty-five years later.

Logical atomism and logical positivism eventually fell out of favor in
philosophy; they did not, however, fall out of favor in scientific
psychology. They found their voice in "operationalism," psychology's
attempt to imitate physics. A notion such as "intelligence" was too
fuzzy for science, but if translated---"operationalized"---into an IQ
test score, intelligence suddenly became an object whose presence or
absence---and even amount---science could measure objectively. My senior
thesis in philosophy solved a small puzzle. It was a careful analysis of
the difference between "same" and "identical," a step on the road to
undermining the thesis that mind and body are identical, because
"identical" entails having the same spatiotemporal coordinates. Mind and
body have the same temporal coordinates (they occur at the same time)
but not the same spatial ones (they do not occur in the same place). So
mind and body are not identical. QED. My thesis even won the philosophy
prize at graduation. In the summer between my junior and senior years, I
did my first laboratory work in psychology, another small school-boy
puzzle. In Byron Campbell's lab, I looked at the effects of electric
shock as punishment. I disconfirmed a current theory about masochism in
rats by showing that they would stay away from shock, and the stronger
the shock, the more they stayed away. Both my senior thesis and this
first bit of psychology were atomistic and rigorous approaches to
well-defined issues. Both were of journal quality. The rat study led to
my very first publication4 (in the top journal), and the argument of my
senior thesis found its way, not under my name but rather under that of
my advisor, George Pitcher, into the philosophical literature. Both were
just baby steps in a professional academic career, and I was quite proud
of them. But neither was deeply satisfying. Although I did not know it
yet, the battle line was drawn. How much rigor? How much reality? This
was a central theme of the transformation of psychology over the next
fifty years and my role in it. Although I could not articulate why then,
both these professional steps were indeed preliminaries to the
preliminaries, and neither shed light on the place where I had dropped
my watch. MY LIFE WAS, of course, not all philosophy and psychology.
Dating played

a large, preoccupying role, but I was ill prepared. From the onset of
puberty through the end of college, I was stuck in all-male settings.

Women were mysterious and exotic, and I was not at ease with them.
Vassar and Bryn Mawr were the women's colleges that Princeton men most
looked to for being "fixed up." The Vassar freshman yearbook had photos,
and a busload of Princeton freshmen traveled to Poughkeepsie to meet the
photo of their choice. But first there was a lottery, and I actually won
it. So I had the very first pick. A gorgeous Swedish blonde, Monica
Skenske, stood out head and shoulders, and she was mine. We arrived at
Vassar and exited the bus in order of the lottery. Monica was there in
the front of the line waiting for me. She was indeed spectacularly
beautiful, but she was also a foot taller than I am. We were a
nonstarter. More than a year later, I spent the summer before my junior
year at Berkeley. I was mostly playing bridge at the Bear's Lair and
shyly ogling women. But there I took my very first psychology course.
Martin Orne, a bear of man at six and a half feet tall and nearly three
hundred pounds, was a social psychologist and the very model of an
enlightened psychoanalyst, with more than a trace of a Viennese accent.
He offered a small seminar with an opaque title: "Demand Characteristics
in the Social Psychological Experiment." I signed up. "Demand
characteristics" turned out to be the artifacts that bias subjects in
experiments to do just what the experimenter wants them to do. So if a
subject walks into a room labeled "Sensory Deprivation Laboratory," is
greeted by a researcher wearing a white coat and stethoscope, and signs
onerous waivers about hallucinations and danger of death, sure enough,
when deprived of sights and sounds for a few hours, she will have
hallucinations. If the sign said, "Meaning Deprivation Laboratory," the
researcher wore jeans, and there were no waiver forms, there would be no
hallucinations. This kind of debunking appealed to my critical
intelligence, my negativity, and my search for "relevant" science. I was
hooked in the very first half hour. Martin was the perfect blend of the
clinic and the laboratory, and in later years he would wind up at the
University of Pennsylvania as a professor in the psychiatry department.
We would be colleagues and friends through his wrongful persecution by
the American Psychiatric Association for allegedly mishandling Anne
Sexton's privacy5 until his untimely death in 2000. I was also one of
three hundred students in an art history lecture course. On the first
day, I spotted a statuesque blonde and grabbed the seat next to her. She
looked familiar, and thrillingly she did not move her foot when mine
brushed it. At the end of the lecture she stood up. She

was a foot taller than I. It was Monica Skenske. I had better luck with
the Bryn Mawr college women. My roommate and bridge partner, Brian X.
Schmidt, introduced me to his high school friend and weekend date,
Kerry. A Bryn Mawr sophomore majoring in Greek and Latin, she regaled me
with descriptions of her research into Greek mythology and her wondrous
professor, Mabel Lang. I was fascinated---she was actually the first
female I had met who was both comely and, like me, serious about
academic work. Serendipity interceded. Two weeks later I was on a train
to Philadelphia, and a frumpily dressed middle-aged woman struck up a
conversation. She told me she was a professor at Bryn Mawr. "Do you know
a Mabel Lang? I just heard such glowing things about her from one of her
students," I asked. "I am Mabel Lang," she said, "and who said such nice
things about me?" "Kerry Mueller." "Oh, yes, Kerry. I am so pleased to
have such an enthusiastic student of Greek. My work is so arcane, the
mysteries of Linear B and all that, most of my students---even the
brightest of the Bryn Mawr girls---don't much care, but to find an
undergraduate so devoted..." Mabel said, and she went on and on. I was
now smitten, not with Mabel (with whom Kerry was smitten) but with
Kerry. We began to spend weekends together, and as captain of the Ivy
League championship bridge team, I had car privileges; my little red VW
plied US Route 1 between Princeton and Bryn Mawr most weekends. We lived
through two national traumas together. "I think we are all going to die
this weekend," pronounced my roommate, Wilfrid Schmid, to Kerry and me
from the top of our twostory suite in Dodge-Osborn. Wilfrid was as sober
an undergraduate as I knew. His father was a noted Greek scholar,
resident at the Institute for Advanced Studies, and his mother, he
reminded us, was murdered by the Americans in the fire-bombing of
Dresden. Wilfrid was a math major. The highest grade at Princeton in the
1960s, the equivalent of an A+, was a 1. A 1+ equaled 100 percent.
Wilfrid would graduate valedictorian with all 1+s, except for a single 1
in a politics course. We had hoped that Princeton would trot out insigne
cum laude (used only once, a century previously) for him, but Wilfrid
and two of his other roommates (eight of

us roomed together in the suite) were relegated to a mere summa cum
laude. "Politics is hard," he muttered, excusing his poor grade and also
commenting on the Cuban Missile Crisis now upon us. We were glued to the
radio in our suite for days, awaiting the end, but it did not come, and
we staggered on to November 1963. "YOUR PRESIDENT HAS been shot," a
German graduate student, Helmut Lamm, shouted to me as I crossed
Washington Road to the psychology laboratory. "President Goheen?" I
asked. When I look back and ask myself which was the saddest event of my
life (and which the happiest), I am surprised. Not the death of my
mother, or the miscarriage of one of my children, not even close. It was
the slaying of John F. Kennedy and equally the slaying of Robert F.
Kennedy. Kerry and I hunkered down in front of the oversized
blackand-white television at Wilson Lodge with about one hundred
Princetonians and their dates (it was supposed to have been a party
weekend) and a dozen of the faculty. Few of us were not red-eyed with
weeping. Back then, before the revelations about his private life, he
was our hero. We personally identified with him in ways we could not
with his predecessor or his successor. He set forth our vision, and we
became the bearers of his torch: "Let the word go forth from this time
and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a
new generation of Americans---born in this century, tempered by war,
disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient
heritage---and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those
human rights to which this nation has always been committed." Soon we
got further tragic news. The body of one of our roommates, Alan Toll
Dunham, an unstained golden boy from Toll Valley, Colorado, was fished
out of the Hudson River. On November 22, he apparently jumped off the
George Washington Bridge and shot himself in the head. I never
discovered why, but even fifty years later I still glimpse him from
behind on busy streets and rush up to embrace him once again, as I did
on his very last day at Princeton. Kerry and I were not overthrown by
the rush of events. The very next weekend, we drove to Albany and
announced to my parents that we were engaged. We were married the day
before graduation.

PETER MADISON TRIED to help me find where I had dropped my watch.

Princeton hired Peter, a fish-out-of-water faculty member, during my
sophomore year. Almost every other one of his colleagues in the
department was an experimental psychologist who tilted toward rigor
rather than reality, and this profile characterized almost all the
faculty of the prestigious psychology departments in America. I used to
wonder how this came about, so I asked Jerome Bruner, one of the deans
of American experimental psychology. Jerry, recently dead at age one
hundred, said, "It happened in 1946, and I was there." The decisive
moment came in a smoke-filled room at the annual conclave of the Society
of Experimental Psychologists, an honorary fraternity (now a sorority as
well) of the most senior and most rigid professors in the field. (I am a
member, though increasingly marginalized for reasons that will become
clear.) By 1946 this group was professing operationalism in the hope
that by imitating physics---the top dog in the scientific
hierarchy---psychology would gain the status of a real science and win
the prestige and funding it so craved. But pressure was building in the
other direction: America's soldiers were returning from war, suffering
countless injuries of body and mind, and the Veterans Administration Act
of 1946 promised employment and grants for psychologists, potentially
transforming psychology from an academic backwater into a health-care
(read "illness-care") profession. Three powerful chairmen of psychology
departments, Gary Boring from Harvard, Samuel Fernberger from Penn, and
Herbert Langfeldt from Princeton, huddled and then announced to the
society that in the future their great departments would "hire no
applied psychologists." Psychology would be the physics of the mind.
Peter Madison was a personality psychologist, not an experimental
psychologist, and he certainly did not do physics of the mind. Princeton
would not have hired him had the University Counseling Service not
needed a new head and had benighted undergraduates not been demanding,
even then, courses on "relevant" issues such as mental illness and
sex---problems rather than puzzles. Peter was recruited from Swarthmore
College, where he studied the lives of individual college students
intensively, a project he continued at Princeton. I volunteered to be a
subject. This entailed writing my autobiography---now lost6---of which
the present book is my second attempt.

personality psychology at Princeton and, at a crucial moment of
professional choice, set me on the path of psychology rather than
philosophy. © 1978 David Madison.

In writing my autobiography I had to choose a pseudonym. I chose
"Jeffrey." Peter asked me why. I told him about Jeffrey Albert. Midway
through my explanation, Peter stopped me, puzzled. He knew of Jeffrey.
Jeff entered Princeton with me, but by sophomore year he had crashed and
burned. He had been expelled for using hard drugs and was now
hospitalized at an expensive private sanitarium. En route Jeff had
casually stolen a girlfriend from me, sleeping with her and then

discarding her, but not until she had discarded me. Peter asked me why I
would name myself after such a shipwreck---exactly the right question.
Why would I, now just beginning to blossom, nevertheless still envy
Jeffrey? I took the entire gamut of personality and intelligence tests
and was interviewed at length by Peter's "Advanced Personality" class. I
did all this not out of mere narcissism and curiosity about myself; it
seemed like a better way of learning about "soft" psychology from the
inside rather than taking one of those notorious "gut" courses. One of
his personality inventories asked me what my "ideal" future self was. I
wrote, "To be like Wittgenstein, surrounded by devoted students and
followers." Another measured my IQ with a test that was sensitive to the
upper end. Peter told me my IQ was 185. I GOT TO know Peter well. He was
tall, soft-spoken, self-effacing, and,

like I am now, very hard of hearing. I leaned on him for personal
advice, which I badly needed by the tail end of my senior year. In April
1964, I opened one fat envelope and was thrilled to find that I had been
granted a National Science Foundation graduate fellowship to study
experimental psychology wherever I chose. But another fat envelope
arrived shortly thereafter, and I found that I had also been offered a
Fulbright fellowship to study analytic philosophy with Geoffrey Warnock
at Magdalen College, Oxford. A psychologist or a philosopher? Actually
it was a trilemma. I had been an avid tournament bridge player since my
teens, and I was captain of Princeton's championship team. (In fact I am
writing this paragraph while waiting for the next hand to be dealt in a
large internet bridge tournament.) At about the same time as the two fat
envelopes arrived, Mark Blumenthal, the captain of the University of
Pennsylvania's second-place bridge team, asked me to turn pro with him.
I gave this serious thought since I loved the game of bridge. Unlike
academia, bridge has a clear bottom line: either you win or you lose.
Even better, bridge knowledge is cumulative: it is perhaps more of a
science than psychology or philosophy. In those days progress in bidding
systems was really being made, and bridge had almost as many serious
journals as psychology. But three facts eliminated bridge as a
profession for me. First, I really was not all that good at it. There
are "naturals" in bridge. The cards just

fly off their hands, and they often can't even tell you how they know
what to do. They just do it. I, in contrast, was a "student." I usually
had to think, sometimes for minutes, getting a headache in the process
and, more often than not, arriving at the wrong answer. Second, making a
living was chancy. The pros, other than the very top ones, slept in
their cars and were grateful to land a novice partner who would pay them
twenty-five dollars a day. Within a year Mark, astonishingly, went on to
become one of the highest-paid professionals in bridge, joining the
Dallas Aces. But I never believed that I played at his level. Academia,
at least, paid a (barely) living wage, even for the less-than-stellar
professor. Third, and this was decisive for me, bridge is just a game,
even if the best of all games. I wanted to help human beings, not just
play. So the choice came down to academic psychology or philosophy. I
asked Bob Nozick what I should do, and imparting the cruelest and
kindest advice I have ever gotten, he said, "Marty, philosophy is a good
preparation for doing something else." Bob was telling me that I would
never scale the high peaks of philosophy---the peaks that he was
ascending even then. THE ROAD NOT TAKEN. Just as I was finishing this
book, fifty-three years

after mulling Bob's words, I made my first visit to Magdalen College as
the guest of David Clark, now the most eminent clinical psychologist in
Great Britain. Is there an opposite of déjà vu---reexperiencing an
alternate life? If so, I had it. When I entered the gates, with the huge
deer park on the left and the greenswarded sixteenth-century quadrangle
on my right, my jaw dropped, and I felt that I had finally---after an
enormously long and exhausting journey---arrived home. When I plopped
down in an overstuffed easy chair under a Turner waterscape, I thought I
might never get up again. At High Table, I engaged the professor of
philosophy in a recounting of Wittgenstein's wielding the poker to
threaten Popper for daring to trivialize him, and then over an old
Madeira, the professor of English and I discussed whether one could use
my big-data methods for measuring happiness (or its lack) in Henry
James. The Princeton philosophy department and all the evening dinners
at the Wilson Society had groomed me for this. I knew how to be charming
at High Table and how to fit right in with Oxford philosophy. In 1964 I
had not the slightest idea of how to be housebroken as a student of
experimental psychology,

and that made all the difference. Given Bob's advice, I decided not to
go to the trouble and expense of crossing the Atlantic that April to
scope out Magdalen. Had I visited, I know I would have stayed forever,
and the world would have had one more mediocre analytic philosopher,
accepting the premises of analytic philosophy, instead of a psychologist
eager to overthrow the dogmas of experimental psychology. what I should
do. He said that in me he recognized a natural psychologist. I
recognized it in myself when he told me this: the cards often just flew
off my hands in psychology. Listening to a lecture or hearing what a
colleague was puzzling about, it seemed that I knew---often deeply and
right away---the answer long before I could explain how I knew it. This
kind of intuition did not sweep over me in philosophy. As in bridge, I
had to think headache-hard in philosophy, and I often came up with the
wrong answer. I take intuition seriously as a mode of knowing, and being
a natural is one theme of this book. For now, suffice it to say that, at
the most pivotal moments in my life, I did psychology by epiphany and by
intuition. By the time I graduated from Princeton, the very texture of
my mental life had changed. I recognized scientific intuition, and I
took my first-blush intuitions seriously. But my daydreaming---the
reverie that went through my mind hours a day---had also transmogrified.
I paid attention to my daydreams---the routine material that floods the
mind of a college student---and their idleness: sexual fantasies,
revenge, social and material success, even death. How useless! I decided
to tame my reverie. My reverie henceforward would be about problems in
psychology and in philosophy. It actually worked, and to this day my
daydreams, and even my night dreams, are not idle. In them I constantly
turn over issues in science, in the same way someone visual might rotate
and examine a complex three-dimensional figure. I work 168 hours per
week. I entertain and welcome outlandish and even bizarre perspectives,
especially waiting for a feeling of "rightness" to strike me. What goes
on in my reverie is "scaffolding," the construction of shortcuts and of
modules about issues I have already visited and revisited. And unlike
thinking about bridge or philosophy, this is effortless and
headache-free. Peter Madison, in parting, told me something else on that
late April morning in 1964. "There are two reasons people go into
psychology. One is not to be wrong. The second is not to be boring. I
hope you choose the I ASKED PETER MADISON

second." With Peter's and Bob's advice, I had, by the end of April of my
senior year, decided to go to graduate school in experimental
psychology. It was between Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, and
so I visited both places. My first stop was New Haven and the laboratory
of the renowned Neal Miller. Neal, a ruddy-faced bull of a man both in
stature and in personal style, was my host. He radiated confidence as
befitted the world's reigning monarch of experimental psychology. His
work bridged both the animal laboratory and the analyst's couch. He was
especially famous for his attempt to operationalize Freudian concepts at
the more basic level in rats. This was a perfect fit for me---taking
clinical insights out of the consulting room and into a setting where
they could be tested. But something bothered me about Neal. He was not
at all bewildered. He knew exactly what he wanted to do next and how he
and his students were going to do it. There are two basic learning
processes, he asserted to me in his nasal twang. There is "instrumental
learning," in which an apparently "voluntary" response like pressing a
bar for food is rewarded and so increases in strength. And there is
"Pavlovian conditioning," in which an apparently "involuntary" response,
like fear as shown by a high heart rate, is preceded by a conditioned
stimulus like a tone, and the tone alone comes to increase the heart
rate. But these two processes, he believed, were really one and the
same. To find out if this was true, you needed to see if you could
increase an involuntary response like heart rate by rewarding it or
decrease it by punishing it. Neal had a team of polished postdocs and
ambitious graduate students grinding away at this problem. If they
succeeded, Neal Miller would go down in history as having discovered the
unifying building block of all learning.

Richard L. Solomon (1918--1995) was my Doktorvater and one of the most
influential learning theorists of his time. His crowning achievement was
his election to the National Academy of Sciences.

He invited me to join the team and offered me a \$500 supplement to the
National Science Foundation graduate fellowship. I was tempted, since
the amount of my fellowship was a mere \$200 per month. But I would be a
mere yeoman cog in a wheel of a big machine working on an idea that was
not my own and about which I had doubts anyway, since neither
instrumental learning nor Pavlovian conditioning struck me as "basic."
My next stop was the University of Pennsylvania, where Richard L.
Solomon greeted me in his College Hall office. Well-tanned, bald,
dapper, and wearing a brown Harris Tweed jacket, he exuded openness.
Dick was one of the young Turks that Penn had rustled away from Harvard.
Reputed to be the first Jewish scientist to get tenure at Harvard, Dick
was famous for his work on the irreversibility of fear conditioning. In
the early 1950s he trained dogs to avoid shock by jumping over a barrier
when a tone went on that heralded shock. First the animals escaped the
shock by jumping over the barrier, but they soon learned that if they
jumped over the barrier earlier---as soon as they heard the tone and
before the shock---they would avoid the shock altogether. The memorable
result was that even if the shock was never presented again, the dogs
just kept jumping. Avoidance never extinguished. Dick argued that the
learning of fear might be irreversible. If true, this would have
profound clinical implications for curing problems like phobias, and
this

intersection between rigorous laboratory studies and mental illness made
Dick Solomon an attractive mentor. Unlike Neal Miller, Dick did not talk
about himself or his own research program, but he did try to elicit my
vision, if any. He did this in a nondirective, bubbly way, chatting
about the issues that puzzled him in his laboratory, hoping I would
"free associate" creatively from his puzzlement. I did not say anything
particularly creative, and in fact I made the mistake of asking Dick if
he would supplement my fellowship by \$500. He agreed, but his daughter
told me many years later, after Dick's death, that he never forgave me
for such an "unacademic" request. At any rate I was favorably impressed,
and one of Dick's rambles stuck with me permanently. "I think the dogs
in my lab are helpless, and I don't know why."

Chapter Five

Twitmyer's Breakthrough

IN THE ROOM that housed my desk in graduate school, one of the great
fiascos of science had taken place sixty years before: Edwin Burket
Twitmyer's announcement of his momentous discovery to the psychological
world. It was not auspicious that my desk sat exactly there. On the
morning of December 29, 1904, the leading lights of American psychology
assembled to listen to each other's papers. The occasion was the
thirteenth annual meeting of the American Psychological Association
(APA), held appropriately enough on the West Philadelphia campus of the
University of Pennsylvania. Penn was home to the very first department
of psychology in America, established in 1887. Its founders had taken
inspiration from Leipzig's Wilhelm Wundt and his brave band of breakaway
German-speaking scientists---brave because they sought nothing less than
a science of mental states, a science of psychology. College Hall, a
Victorian pile of green and brown stone, sat in the center of the few
buildings that constituted the University of Pennsylvania. To attend the
paper reading, these professors, the men wearing heavy dark suits and
white shirts with rounded collars, trudged up the twelve concrete steps
and through the heavy double doors. It is noteworthy that the assemblage
was not solely male since the next APA president, Mary Whiton Calkins,
was among them. They turned right, strode the length of the wide
corridor with its fifteen-foot ceiling, and entered the large classroom.
On the dais sat William James himself, the newly inaugurated president
of the American Psychological Association, holding that post for the
second time. James was a founder of American psychology, having
established the first American "psychological laboratory" at

Harvard in 1875, even while teaching physiology. His was an aweinspiring
presence. Erect and wiry, with striking blue eyes, his light beard now
mostly gray, James was an affable and witty conversationalist. Like his
dour brother, novelist Henry James, William was quite fragile, having
suffered at least two "nervous breakdowns," and he was a prolific but
much less fusty a writer than Henry. His acclaimed 1,200-page Principles
of Psychology was already the classic textbook, and his influential
essay "Does Consciousness Exist?" had just come out.1 James called the
morning session to order, and the reading of papers began. You, my
reader, and even I would have found the session dull--- our knowledge of
what was about to happen notwithstanding---and we would have spent our
time gazing out the twelve-foot windows onto the green fields. R. S.
Woodworth reported a high correlation between the strength of the right
hand and the left. Margaret Washburn discoursed on the difference
between a "feeling" and a "sensation." Hugo Muensterberg somehow united
the truth of arithmetic with the values of morality and religion.
Lightner Witmer, director of the psychological clinic of the Penn
department, reported on the accuracy of guesses about the heaviness of
very similar weights. A polite, low-key discussion lasting about ten
minutes followed each paper. At least one person in the audience was
terrifically excited, barely able to contain himself.
Thirty-one-year-old Edwin B. Twitmyer was about to report on his 1902
doctoral dissertation. He suspected that he had captured the most
fundamental particle of learning. This was a grand venture with a
venerable provenance. David Hume (1711--1776), the founder of
"associationism," claimed that we could never observe cause directly;
rather we could only observe the contiguity in time between two events.
The red billiard ball strikes the white ball, and the white ball shoots
off into the pocket. We infer that the motion of the red ball caused the
white ball's motion, but all we ever see is an association in time. Such
associations are the fundamental building blocks of all learning, since
for the British empiricists, of whom Hume was the leading light, the
mind is but a blank slate that experience writes on. And what does
experience write on the blank slate? Only these associations, and so all
that we learn, all that we know, is merely the combination of countless
pairings. This became a program for scientific psychology. If science
could isolate and measure such associations in the laboratory, science
would be

able to measure learning objectively and get on its way to unraveling
the mysteries of all knowledge. The scientist who discovered how to do
this would achieve immortality. Twitmyer believed he had done it. When
the human kneecap is struck ---just right---with a rubber hammer, a
large kick ensues. This is called the patellar reflex. Reflexes are not
learned; they are the nervous system's inevitable and unconscious
reaction to a stimulus. Twitmyer, ingeniously, rang a bell half a second
before each hammer blow. Sure enough after 150 or more pairings, the
bell itself was followed by the kick---even before the hammer blow. This
worked for every one of Twitmyer's six subjects. This should all sound
familiar, because in Saint Petersburg at just the same time and for
similar reasons, Ivan Petrovich Pavlov was doing essentially the same
thing---independently. Pavlov paired the clicking of a metronome with
food powder injected into the mouths of dogs and found that the clicks
alone came to elicit salivation. Pavlov added an important wrinkle:
digestive surgeon that he was---not a psychologist--- he extruded the
salivary gland of the dog, and so he could count precisely the number of
drops of saliva elicited by the clicks, rather than just weighing some
mushy food. Pavlov, already renowned for his work on digestion for which
he got the Nobel Prize in 1904, trumpeted these results in Madrid in
1903 in his Nobel acceptance speech. Pavlov achieved immortality for
discovering this, the "conditional reflex."2 Twitmyer did not achieve
immortality. For at the close of his paper, James said, "Just in time
for lunch. I guess there won't be any discussion of this paper. Let's go
eat." Why didn't Twitmyer get any credit at all for this important
discovery? For one thing Twitmyer's 1902 dissertation was privately
printed and so inaccessible, while Pavlov---already an international
icon ---was able to spread the word of his latest discovery in his Nobel
acceptance speech. Twitmyer, in contrast, was a newbie and seems to have
shyly avoided anything that smacked of self-promotion. For another,
American psychologists at this time focused on consciousness, whereas a
reflex was merely physical and mechanical, hardly the key that would
unlock the mind. But it is also a sad fact that William James was bored
and hungry.3

Kneecapped, Twitmyer dropped his conditioning work and turned his
attention to his wife's specialty, speech defects in children. Sixty
years later this wound to the collective psyche of Penn's proud
department still festered, and I could sense it as Professor Francis W.
Irwin related the Twitmyer story to us. Frank had been at the center of
the only psychology coup d'état of the last century. Since Twitmyer's
time Penn's department had gotten sleepier and sleepier, and by 1955 it
was snoring audibly. As the longtime editor in chief of the prestigious
Journal of Experimental Psychology, Frank was one of the only faculty
members who still had his finger on the pulse of any living science. He
persuaded Penn's high administration that a rustling was in order, and
the victim of the raid was to be Harvard's psychology department. Two
rival tyrants then reigned over Harvard: B. F. (Fred) Skinner, the star
of 1950s behaviorism, and S. S (Smitty) Stevens, the world's leading
mathematical psychophysiologist. But chafing under their whip hands were
a half dozen brilliant young psychologists. Penn contacted Robert Bush,
the political leader of these young Turks, and in one fell swoop Penn
offered all of them full professorships. All of them accepted, and you
will meet this cast of characters shortly. Nothing like this had ever
happened before in psychology; nor has it since. So in 1958 a
rejuvenated department under the chairmanship of Bob Bush suddenly
appeared at 121 College Hall. Penn became---overnight---the place to be.
Frank told us the Twitmyer story on the very first day of the
proseminar, the grueling yearlong, five-day-a-week course in which every
single faculty member taught, seriatim, his (pronoun accurate) personal
research in detail. Frank (PhD, Penn 1931) was the senior member of the
faculty, and he actually knew Twitmyer. Austerely dressed in a
threadbare gray suit and gray-blue tie, he looked considerably older
than his sixty years---although everyone over fifty looked ancient to me
at the time. He chain-smoked and at one point had three cigarettes
smoldering---he was every bit as nervous as the twenty graduate students
newly arrived at the place to be. He had every right to be nervous since
he was presenting the culmination of his forty years' work on learning
to a hypercritical

audience. Young as we were, we were up to date about the very latest in
learning theory---trends Frank was deeply skeptical about. He did not
believe in stimulus-response-reinforcement theory, which held a monopoly
in the field of learning. Frank came to maturity as this monopoly grew.
To appreciate why behaviorism came to exert over the world of psychology
a hold so strong that Frank spent his entire career fighting it, let's
return to William James's shooing everyone out to lunch. William James
was likely bored by the reflexes of the knee and for good reason. The
associationists were thoroughgoing mentalists: an association was the
pairing of two mental states: the idea of wooden false teeth evokes an
image of the unsmiling George Washington. James believed that mental
states---ideas, images, knowledge, attention, and awareness---were the
true subjects of psychology. You can bet that James began to gaze out
the window soon after the talk started, thinking that this Twit-fellow
was irrelevant: no science of mind would ever come from low-level
reflexes. But James did not reckon on behaviorism, the up-and-coming
movement that dispensed with mental life altogether on the grounds that
only behavior can be reliably measured. The psychological world listened
to Pavlov, if not to Twitmyer, with growing---and then
exploding---interest. Through the first decade of the twentieth century,
discontent was rife in the field. The mentalism that pervaded the 1904
meeting increasingly clashed with the materialism of the harder
sciences, spurred on by the remarkable success of Einsteinian physics in
the first twenty years of the twentieth century. Not only were ideas,
sensations, images, and awareness "soul" stuff and science "body" stuff,
but, even worse, these mental states were notoriously hard to measure.
If two introspecting subjects might disagree about what they saw when
light of a given wavelength was flashed---blue, dark blue, reddish
purple, or deep purple---what of their even bigger disagreements when
introspecting about images and ideas? Behaviorism was elegant. It sought
to rid psychology of the quicksand of mental stuff and to place
measurable behavior as the concrete footing that real science requires.
A rat turning left or right in a maze was more measurable and more
replicable than the sensation of slimy as composed of the sensation of
warm plus that of wet. John Broadus Watson ignited the revolution in
1913 at Columbia University.4

Psychology, he thought, should be "a purely objective experimental
branch of natural science," aiming not to understand the fluff of the
mind but to predict and control behavior. Introspection was a muddle,
and behavior was the right unit for scientific analysis. Within two
decades, behaviorism had swept away introspection entirely, and its
experimental psychologists ascended to the top professorships of
American psychology. The science of mind had transformed into the
science of behavior, and "learning theory" now sat on the throne.
Learning theory had three basic elements: stimulus, response, and
reinforcer. "Stimulus" and "response" were the American derivation of
Ivan Pavlov's work, the leading exemplar of good behavioral science.
Food was the "unconditioned stimulus" and salivation the "unconditioned
response" elicited by the food. The clicking of the metronome became the
"conditioned stimulus" when paired with food, and the little bit of
salivation that occurred in response was the "conditioned response."
"Reinforcer," the third element of the behaviorist triad, descended from
Edward L. Thorndike's work at Columbia Teacher's College. He put cats in
"puzzle boxes," in which pulling a string would open a door leading to
food and freedom. The cats learned only gradually, not by sudden
insight, and Thorndike proposed the "law of effect": associations
followed by a "satisfier" are strengthened; those followed by an
"annoyer" are weakened.5 This was solid behavioral work, but Thorndike's
language needed purging by the language police. So, stripped of
Thorndike's mentalism, a "reinforcer" was an event that, when made
contingent on a response, increased the probability of that
response---no need to postulate mental satisfaction or reward. Out of
these simple elements, so the program went, the entire edifice of all
learning would be constructed. When my parents asked me on one of my
visits back to Albany what I was, I proudly responded, "I am a learning
theorist." Frank Irwin would also have said, "I am a learning theorist,"
although he would have termed this his "action" and not his "response."
Frank told us on that first day that stimulus, response, and reinforcer
were bosh. Instrumental behavior is not governed by blind reinforcement
but rather is intentional---even in rats. Rats (and certainly people)
are cognitive and choose their most highly preferred available outcome.
Frank's skepticism

resonated with me; that animals might be cognitive was on my mind when I
later undertook my work on learned helplessness. So, a central premise
of psychology as I first knew it was that the discipline could safely
ignore thinking and consciousness, could ignore all of "mind." For the
behaviorists, impeccable measurement topped everything. Behavior could
be known with certainty, but mind could not, so mind was outside
science. And it was not just the behaviorists who eschewed mind. For the
Freudians, it was no accident that Freud used die Seele, the soul, to
describe the scope of his endeavor. Seele was then crudely mistranslated
as the "mind," which is not at all what Freud meant. For Freudians, mind
is merely the froth on the cappuccino, and Freud was not much interested
in the froth of the conscious mind. Freud was after the espresso, the
roiling deep of negative emotion that drives the meanderings of
consciousness. These militant denials of cognition led to blind spots:
that consciousness is not causal, that imagination has no role, and that
free will is an illusion. I could not begin to articulate these blind
spots when I entered graduate school, but contrary to the prevailing
wisdom of 1964, today, fifty years later, we know the following: •
Conscious thoughts powerfully influence emotions. Thoughts of
helplessness produce passivity. Thoughts of loss produce sadness.
Thoughts of trespass produce anger. Thoughts of a better future produce
hope. A science of behavior without the mind is hopelessly insufficient.
• We continually imagine different futures, we evaluate them, and we
choose among them. Try as we might, we cannot shake off free will. A
science that is only about the past (memory) and the present
(perception) without an account of future-mindedness is hopelessly
insufficient. • A science that is only about negative emotions is
hopelessly insufficient. Much of my own story over the next fifty years
would be about the struggle to carve out a scientific psychology
congenial to these truths.

EVEN THOUGH MY fellow graduate students were the cream of the next

generation of behaviorists, one among them shared my deep doubts. Steve
Maier was his name. We met on our very first day at Penn, standing at
the departmental reception desk waiting for the ever-harassed department
administrator, Ada Katz, to give us our course schedule. Steve told me
that he hailed from the City College of New York and before that from
Bronx Science, the legendary high school for the brightest kids from New
York. Within the first three minutes, he startled me with the
information that he had made his living in high school running numbers
in Harlem. He wanted me to know that he was a tough New York City street
kid. When he made a point, he did not waste words, and he tended to
repeat his same words for emphasis. But it was more than just "no
nonsense, please": I sensed immediately that he had an active bullshit
detector always on high gain. We talked about learning theory, and he
chuckled a lot, giving voice to the inchoate contempt for conventional
thinking we shared. At the end of our thirty-minute wait, I said, "Let's
work together." "Sure," he replied without a hesitation. Steve and I
would be friends and collaborators for the rest of our lives. Steve
would, four decades later, make what I consider to be the most important
discovery ever in the neuroscience of emotion: the hope circuit.

Chapter Six

Learned Helplessness (1964--1967)

THE STORY OF learned helplessness began well before that day in 1964
when Steve Maier and I arrived at the University of Pennsylvania. As
Steve and I were looking for a project to do together, Dick's bewildered
mention of "helplessness" came back to me, and I talked with Bruce
Overmier, Dick's most senior graduate student, the person who, as best I
could ascertain, first discovered it. For Bruce, two years earlier in
1962, it had been an annoyance to root out, not a phenomenon to
investigate. In his first year as a graduate student, he, like many of
the brightest kids in the field of learning, wanted to know how the two
"basic" learning processes interacted and if they could be unified. This
endeavor was a first cousin of Neal Miller's obsession with finding a
single basic process. Bruce's question was this: If a dog first had
Pavlovian fear conditioning in which a tone preceded a shock, then the
dog learned to jump a barrier to escape a shock not preceded by a tone,
would the tone increase fear and propel the dog to jump even faster?
This was a simple enough question, so Bruce and Russ Leaf, then the
senior graduate student, built the equipment and carried out the study.
It involved two distinct settings. The first was a comfortable rubber
hammock in which the dogs lay, with shock electrodes attached to their
back paws. A loud tone sounded, and five seconds later a mild shock---
strong enough to make the dog bark but much too weak to do any tissue
damage---started, lasting for five seconds. They repeated this
sixty-four times over the course of one hour, ample Pavlovian
conditioning trials to make the dog fear the tone. This first part went
according to expectations. The second part introduced the big,
unexpected problem. Russ and

Bruce built a shuttle box, a six-foot-long, two-chambered room with
steel grids on the floor and a low barrier between the two sides. In the
shuttle box, dogs learned easily to avoid shock: the lights dimmed and
five seconds later the grid floor was electrified---again with a
mildmoderate shock, just strong enough to provoke a jump over the
barrier to escape. The idea was to turn on the tone from the earlier
session in the hammock and see if it made the dogs jump faster. But the
experiment fizzled. The dogs conditioned in the hammock did not jump the
barrier. They just lay down and did not try to escape the shock. This
was unprecedented and enormously frustrating for the investigators. This
I had to see. So Bruce took Steve and me up to the lab on the third
floor of the decrepit Hare building, just around the corner from College
Hall, to show me the dogs. Indeed the dogs looked helpless--- whatever
that might mean in scientific terms. Bruce also showed me the
two-inch-deep gouge in the sickly green wall where a furious Russ Leaf
threw his clipboard in frustration. What Bruce and Russ saw as an
annoyance,1 Steve and I saw as the phenomenon, one of much
farther-reaching importance than unifying Pavlovian conditioning and
instrumental learning. Helplessness in humans is ubiquitous and the
source of endless suffering. Could we capture it in the laboratory?
Could we discover what causes it? Could we discover how to reverse it?
Could we discover its brain physiology? Could we discover how to prevent
it? This was why I became a psychologist. FROM THE BEGINNING I thought
the phenomenon looked like helplessness.

But what, we puzzled, were the elements of helplessness? How did it come
about? How could we test for it? What were its consequences? How did it
relate to mental illness? How could we begin to do serious science on
the mere intuition that the dogs had become helpless?

I met Steve Maier on my first day in graduate school at Penn, and we
agreed to collaborate on the spot. He became a serious neuroscientist
and upended our theory of learned helplessness. Steve is pictured here
at the time he made his major discoveries that overturned our original
theory. Photo courtesy of Steve Maier.

We began by defining it. Central to our intuitive notion of

helplessness was the belief that nothing one does matters. This was
subjective helplessness, but what, first, were the conditions of
objective helplessness that might lead to such a belief? This was a
thorny question, and its solution ran afoul of the most sacred premises
of the learning theory that ruled academia. Formally, an animal or a
person is objectively helpless about an important outcome, such as shock
offset, if the probability of that outcome, given a response, does not
differ from the probability of that outcome in the absence of that
response. When this is true of all responses, objective helplessness
exists. Notice---as every learning theorist had previously failed
to---that all Pavlovian conditioning is helplessness: no response of the
animal made any difference to the outcome. The food came whether or not
the dog salivated. The shock followed the tone whether or not the rat's
heart rate rose. Pavlovian conditioning entails objective helplessness
by definition, and it seemed never to have dawned on anyone that animals
might learn this and that they might find this more urgently important
than the Pavlovian part of the experiment. A strong theory, such as
Pavlov's, tells scientists what to look at and what to ignore, and
around Pavlovian conditioning there descended a hegemony of silence
about what to ignore. Once you digest this unpacking of "nothing one
does matters," helplessness seems straightforward---there is no relation
between what happens to the dog and what the dog does. So we proposed
that animals (and people) could learn that they were helpless, and for
that to happen, the animal had to "detect" this lack of relation and so
must be able to learn that outcomes like shock offset were independent
of its responses. This was a radical suggestion for the 1960s. The
learning theorists of that era, the grandchildren of early behaviorism,
were stubbornly "associationistic" and militantly anti-mentalistic.
Cognition was to be shunned, and the underlying program was to show that
the "illusion" of cognition entailed nothing more than simple
stimulus-response associations. Animals can learn only pairings---for
example, a response paired with shock, strengthening the association
(acquisition), or a response paired with no shock, weakening the
association (extinction). These pairings are the only two kinds of
"magic moments" that can produce learning. It seemed to us that the
integration of two conditional probabilities---the probability of shock
given a response and the probability of shock in the absence of that
response---was an act that

required brain power rather than mere behavioral conditioning. For this
reason we called our theory "learned" helplessness rather than
"conditioned" helplessness, in the process rejecting the simple premises
that both Pavlovian conditioning and instrumental learning held so dear.
Emblematic of the tension between learning theory and cognitive theory
was a standoff between Dave Williams, a young radical behaviorist
professor, and me in the first-year learning proseminar. "So you think,
Marty, that animals have a rich mental life?" Dave asked, as if mockery
should end the argument. I did indeed think that higher mammals were
richly cognitive and that the ability to form expectations about the
future had given us an edge in the never-ending competition to survive.
But these beliefs were so out of keeping with behaviorism that one
either shut up or one endured mockery. I didn't shut up, and neither did
Steve. All of this made us outcasts on our home turf by putting us
squarely in the camp of what would soon be called "cognitive"
psychology. Two winds were already blowing in the gathering storm of the
cognitive revolution. The first was Jean Piaget's sound scientific
observations on the mental processes of children. The second was Noam
Chomsky's devastating review (1959)2 of B. F. Skinner's long-awaited
volume (1957)3 allegedly demonstrating that language could be understood
in strictly behaviorist terms. Chomsky, a rebellious linguist and
talented polemicist, argued that the essence of language was not
reinforcement--- the repetition of old verbal habits---but generativity:
speakers could produce and understand entirely novel utterances, such as
"There is a purple Gila monster flying through the kitchen," never
before encountered by anyone. Learned helplessness, arguing that animals
were cognitive, was the third wind, and the fourth wind, the one that
transformed this into a hurricane, got started in 1965 at Penn. Ulric
Neisser, on sabbatical from the Brandeis University psychology
department, was spending 1965--1966 at Penn writing his great book
Cognitive Psychology.4 He offered us a graduate course, which consisted
of discussing his working manuscript. Dick, as we all called him, argued
that behaviorism got its sea legs by somehow convincing psychologists
that replicable, objective science on mental life was impossible. New
experiments showed that they were wrong, and this kind of work justified
a new science of the mind. Just one example suffices. Briefly flash up
on a screen a brightly lit ten-by-ten matrix of random

letters. Turn it off two seconds later. It disappears from the screen,
but the subject still has an "afterimage" of the matrix before his eyes.
Now flash an arrow where the third row of the matrix used to be, and ask
the subject to read off the letters still in his afterimage. The subject
gets seven of the ten right, and this quantifies how much information is
still there in the mind's eye two seconds after the objective stimulus
is gone. How long does the afterimage last? Instead of waiting two
seconds, vary the interval, and discover the rate at which the
afterimage melts to nothing. This is a rigorous measure of the rate of
decay of a mental image. The scientist can even tell precisely how
bright the afterimage in the mind's eye is. During the interval, flash
up masking lights of differing intensities and discover the brightness
at which the afterimage is exactly masked. The duration, the amount of
information, and the brightness of a mental image can be exactly
measured. So very fine, quantitative science can be done on mental life.
Dick published his blockbuster book the following year, and the
cognitive revolution---which is still with us in 2018---began to sweep
behaviorism away, just as behaviorism had swept mental life away at the
end of William James's life. Steve and I, deeply impressed, were also in
midst of testing whether animals were cognitive. How could we find out
if it was the lack of contingency between response and shock and not the
shock itself that produced the profound failure to escape in the shuttle
box? How could we find out if animals actually learned that nothing they
did mattered? To assess this question, we had to isolate the
noncontingency from the shock. So three groups were needed. One group
got escapable shock (ESC), where shock offset was contingent on the
animal's response. So in our first helplessness experiment,5 these dogs
learned in the hammock to press a panel with their noses to turn off the
shock. The second group was yoked to the ESC group, getting exactly the
same duration, intensity, and pattern of shocks, but their responses had
no effect on the shock. In this inescapable shock group (INESC), shock
offset and all the animal's responses were noncontingently related. A
third group (Zero) got no shock. The next day the dogs were tested in
shuttle box escape. We ran twenty-four dogs through our new "triadic"
design and found that all the dogs in the ESC group and all the dogs in
the Zero group readily learned

to escape in the shuttle box, but five of the eight dogs in the INESC
failed altogether to learn to escape. Importantly the ESC and the Zero
group learned to escape equally well. We concluded that the animals in
the INESC group learned in the hammock that shock offset was independent
of their responses, and when shock occurred the next day in the shuttle
box, they expected that its offset would once again be independent of
their response. This expectation undermined their trying ("response
initiation") to escape. They had learned helplessness. Our first
publication on helplessness, outlining our cognitive theory, was, to our
surprise, published as the lead article in the prestigious but
archconservative Journal of Experimental Psychology.6 The reviews
contained only one criticism: "paralyse is usually spelled with a 'z.'"
We briefly harbored the illusion that learned helplessness would be well
accepted, and it would be smooth sailing from there, but we were wrong.
The learning theorists, sensing that the rising storm would soon pose a
mortal threat, closed ranks against cognitive theorizing in all forms,
particularly in animals. There was a hostile encounter at the Princeton
University conference where Steve and I first unveiled the theory to the
major learning theorists:7 Dick Herrnstein, B. F. Skinner's right-hand
man and articulate gunslinger, retorted, "You are proposing that animals
learn that responding is ineffective. Animals learn only
responses---they don't learn that anything." Animals for the behaviorist
are stimulusresponse machines, not creatures that can ever learn
propositions. We defined a dimension that we called "control over
outcomes," with control being present whenever the probability of an
outcome, given a response, differs from the probability of that outcome
in the absence of that response. Clearly, the escapable subjects
controlled an aspect of the aversive event (when the shock went off),
and the inescapable subjects did not. This was exactly why we developed
the triadic design and included the escapable subjects as a control
group as well as the zero group, because it isolated the element of
uncontrollability: if failure to escape in the shuttle box was caused by
learning uncontrollability, then this failure should not occur if
uncontrollability was removed but the shocks stayed identical. That is,
we assumed that uncontrollability was the active ingredient in producing
passivity and that escapable subjects were later escaping normally in
the shuttlebox because they lacked this critical learning ingredient. We
found out, almost fifty years later, when Steve finally unraveled

the brain processes, that our theory was 180 degrees off. Steve
discovered that helplessness is not learned; rather it is mammals'
default response to prolonged bad events. What is vouchsafed to mammals
is learning that bad events can be controlled. One of the privileges of
doing science for fifty years is that it is long enough to find out that
you were wrong, and I will tell you the story of Steve's discovery of
the Hope Circuit in Chapter 28. Much of the work Steve and I did in
graduate school centered on testing the theory of learned helplessness.
But I became a psychologist not to test theories but to relieve
suffering, and animal experiments really only mattered to me if they
could lessen the amount of misery on the planet. I was sure that what we
had seen in our dogs was about something larger. So I began to study
abnormal psychology under Jim Geer, a behavior therapist newly arrived
at Penn as an assistant professor. I told Jim about our dogs, and he
came up to the lab to see them. "Those dogs are depressed," Jim told me.
"What is depression?" I asked Jim. I spent much of the next ten years
trying to answer my own question. So in addition to theory testing we
did two kinds of experiments anticipating the clinical applications of
learned helplessness. First, we asked about prevention---we called it
"immunization," influenced by the Salk and Sabin vaccines that had
recently put an end to polio. If our dogs first learned that they could
control shock and then experienced inescapable shock, would they not
become helpless? Immunization worked: dogs that first learned to turn
off shock in the hammock by pushing a panel with their noses, then had
enough inescapable shock to make naive dogs helpless, later easily
learned to escape in the shuttle box by jumping the barrier. These dogs,
we believed, expected that they could control shock and so did not give
up. They were immunized against helplessness. We also worked on
"therapy." Once a dog was helpless in the shuttle box, what could we do
to cure him? We took inspiration from "exposure" work in behavior
therapy. Spider-phobic people, for example, who are forced to endure
being in the presence of spiders until they discover that nothing bad
happens, are cured. So we decided to show the helpless dogs that they
had control over shock. We dragged them across the shuttle box and out
of the shock that they were passively enduring. We showed them that
getting to the other side worked. After a few draggings, the dogs

perked up and began to jump on their own. This was true of every dog, a
100 percent cure.8 Ethics There was a snowy-white, long-haired dog in
the laboratory. I spent a lot of time with him. I loved him, and he
loved me. I wanted to adopt him, but Steve and I weren't allowed pets in
our apartments. So after the experiment we took him in Steve's aging
Plymouth Valiant to Fairmont Park, the Manhattan-sized park in the
middle of Philadelphia, and we set him free. Two weeks later he
reappeared in our laboratory, captured once again by the people who
rounded up stray dogs and sold them to laboratories. I do not know his
fate, but I have dreamed about him at least once a month for the rest of
my life. Running dog experiments was a harrowing experience for us. We
were both dog lovers, and had we not found ourselves in a laboratory in
which dog experiments were already underway and unquestioned, we would
not have chosen this path. As soon as I could I stopped experimenting
with dogs; I ran rats and then people in helplessness experiments, with
exactly the same pattern of results as with dogs. I have not run an
animal experiment in more than forty years, and I have thought long and
hard about the practice. There are three kinds of issues that bear on
the "ethics" of animal experiments such as ours. The first is
"sentimental." It feels bad to do these experiments. Unlike some
scientists, I never habituated to feeling bad. I cringed then and I
still cringe remembering them. I still dream of the white dog, with love
and with guilt. The second issue is "moral." Peter Singer, a critic of
learnedhelplessness experiments, has put it well.9 To wit: all life is
sacred, and a civilized morality extends the human moral circle to
animals. Animals are equally entitled to our sympathy and protection as
other human beings are. Singer considers it "speciesism" to believe that
humans deserve special rights. In this view, even if the shock was mild
to moderate in our experiments (and I tested it on myself, producing a
sudden startle but no pain), it is always and absolutely wrong to shock
animals. I strongly disagree with this kind of moral absolutism.
Inflicting pain on animals (or people) is wrong, but not absolutely
wrong. This is but

one value in a complex world of clashing values. Curbing the epidemic of
depression, suicide, and posttraumatic stress is another value. Markedly
decreasing the tonnage of human suffering in the world matters more to
me and to most other people as well. These are difficult choices,
particularly when the cringe factor is strong and one cannot see clearly
into the future. The progress that was made over the next decades in
curing and preventing mental illness as a result of our studies---which
I discuss in later chapters---tells me that we saw into the future with
considerable accuracy. The final ethical issue is "scientific." All
animal experiments that try to make inferences to humans must tangle
with the problem of external validity. This is a crucial, neglected, and
really hairy issue. Experimental psychology's rigor, its internal
validity, had attracted me to the field. A controlled experiment is the
gold standard of internal validity because it discovers what causes
what. Does the fire cause the water to boil? Turn on the fire, and the
water boils. Without the fire (the control), the water does not boil. Do
uncontrollable bad events spur tumor growth? Implant tumors in rats and
then give one group of rats inescapable shock, give another group
identical escapable shock, and compare them to a group that receives no
shock. Rats that get inescapable shock grow a cancerous tumor at a
greater rate; hence, inescapable shock causes tumor growth in rats.10
But what does this tell us about the causes of cancer in human beings,
and what does that tell us about how helplessness influences cancer in
human beings? This is the problem of external validity. When laypeople
complain about psychology experiments with the gibe "white rats and
college sophomores," it is external validity that is in dispute. It may
seem simplistic, but it is a profound complaint. Human beings differ in
many ways from the white laboratory version of Rattus norvegicus.
Inescapable shock differs in many ways from finding out that your child
drowned in a boating accident. The tumor implanted in Rattus norvegicus
differs in many ways from the naturally occurring tumors that afflict
human beings. So even if the internal validity is perfect---rigorous
experimental design, the exactly right control group, large enough
numbers to insure randomization, and impeccable statistics---we still
cannot infer with confidence that this illuminates the effect that
uncontrollable bad events will exert on cancer in people. I have come to
think that establishing external validity is an even

more important, but much more nettlesome, scientific task than
establishing internal validity. Academic psychology requires all serious
psychology students to take entire courses on internal validity. These
"methodology" courses are entirely about internal validity and almost
never touch on external validity, which is often passed off as mere
philistinism about science on the part of ignorant laymen. Hundreds of
professors of psychology make their livings teaching "scientific" method
and statistics, the trappings of internal validity, but no one makes a
living teaching about external validity. Unfortunately, public doubts
about the applicability of basic, rigorous science are often warranted,
and this is because the rules of external validity are not clear. As you
will see in later chapters, I went on to work for years asking if the
helplessness experiments in dogs and then rats and then people had
external validity and if they illuminated real helplessness in real
human beings. They did. So learned helplessness in dogs was the choice I
made, and if it were offered to me again, I would steel myself and make
the same choice.

Chapter Seven

A Clinical Psychologist (1967)

I SPRINTED THROUGH THE Penn PhD program in two years and eight months,
eclipsing the all-time Penn psychology record. The disenfranchised life
of a graduate student grated on me, and I soon accepted my first job:
assistant professor of psychology at Cornell University. I asked my
students to call me Marty, the nickname I've had since Dickie Fink
bestowed it upon me at age eleven, rather than "Doctor Seligman." I
hoped this would break down the psychological distance between
undergraduate and professor, and I've kept this moniker all my life. No
one but my sister Beth and my parents---and I myself---calls me Martin.
In work and in life, I strove to be an intellectual, the old-fashioned
kind. My loyalty was---and still is---to the big questions, not just to
those that were fashionable within psychology or philosophy. I read
widely, from literary classics to thrillers to history to the obscure
academic journals. I listened to classical music---Monteverdi to
Mahler---in my "spare" time. I kept trying to "improve" myself. I took
no time off. I also had a skeptical nature. I scoured for the most
"basic" accepted premises in psychology and asked what followed if the
premises were wrong. My reflexive loyalty was to the ideas that needed
defenders. As with my PhD studies, I tried to do all of this in a hurry.
I wanted to finish things, and I was brash. I took shortcuts. Wrapped up
in my own thoughts, I didn't listen well, drifting inward almost
immediately to play mentally with how what I was hearing fitted the
issues I had been pondering. People thought that I was riding roughshod
over them, but I think this was a side effect of such self-absorption. I
was puzzled about why they didn't much like me. I was ambitious, and I
knew what I was ambitious for. Peter

Madison's personality inventories stayed with me, and my ambition was to
be like Wittgenstein, surrounded by devoted students and followers.
Finally, I was negative. The academic questions I asked were about
helplessness, hopelessness, trauma, fear, and depression. My critical
antennae were always up, and I easily found flaws. My mood was
congruent: I was anxious and grumpy a lot. "THEY'VE GOT YOU by the
balls, Joe," shouted Jim Geer merrily.

This was my introduction to the haute monde of psychiatry. Philadelphia
in 1967 was right at the cutting edge of a revolution. The epicenter of
the revolution was Joe Wolpe's monthly salon, held in the cavernous
living room of his hypermodern house in Merion, a western suburb of
Philadelphia. His salon had become a magnet for behavior therapists from
all over the northeastern United States. Psychoanalysis had dominated
American psychiatry---both in academia and in the therapy trenches---for
forty years. This was not a benign tyranny. Following Freud's example
and that of the traditional, authoritarian European professor,
dissenters were drummed out of the profession. But the dike had sprung
two leaks, and the torrent was starting. One was drugs.1 In the 1950s
Thorazine was tried out on paranoid schizophrenics, and their delusions
seem to melt away. Depressives given imipramine, an antitubercular, sang
and danced in the corridors. Worried housewives took Valium and,
Stepford-like, seemed content. The other was behavior therapy. Its
founder was Joe Wolpe, the guy Jim thought we had by the balls. Joe was
a recent emigrant from a hostile ---both to his politics and to his
science---South Africa. He was in his mid-forties, bald, pugnacious,
outspoken, and iconoclastic. In his hornrimmed glasses, he reminded me
of an owl, wise, yes, but also ready to pounce on a prey. He had
accomplished something that no one else in psychiatry had done before.
Joe treated anxiety disorders, his specialty being phobias. Phobics are
deathly afraid of specific objects, such as cats or spiders or going
shopping. They were routinely treated by psychoanalysts who probed for
the underlying, unresolved childhood conflict of which the object of the
adult fear was but a symbol. In the classic case, Little Hans,2 at the
age of four, saw a horse fall down in a Vienna street. He became
terrified of horses. Freud interpreted this as a fear that his father
would castrate him,

a fear that Hans had displaced onto horses. Hans, duly enlightened, was
said by his father to recover. Crucial to the Freudian theory of phobia,
and to Freud's theory of all mental disorders, was the premise that an
underlying problem causes the symptoms, just as an underlying spirochete
causes the symptoms of syphilis. Joe thought this was hogwash. The
symptom of the phobia itself caused the phobia. A cat phobic had no
underlying conflict; she was just terrified of cats. Period. And Joe set
out to prove it. The cat phobic, he theorized, must have previously had
a traumatic experience in a place where cats happened to be. Her father
might, for example, have spanked her when a cat was in the same room. By
Pavlovian conditioning, the previously neutral cat became a stimulus
that now evoked fear. If Joe was right, the therapeutic course was
clear. Extinguish the conditioned fear, and the phobia would vanish!
Extinction should occur if the therapist got the patient up off the
couch and presented cats to her now, but paired with no fear. Easier
said than done, since presenting a cat in the consulting room would
precipitate panic, not extinction. But Joe invented a way to do it and
dubbed it "systematic desensitization." First Joe had the patient learn
"whole body relaxation," in which she relaxed every muscle in her body.
Profound relaxation is a motor response incompatible with fear---you
can't be afraid when you are relaxed. (Joe liked incompatible motor
responses as explanations of extinction, and we will soon hear him
invoke them in an argument with Steve and me.) Next Joe had the relaxed
patient imagine someone named "Katz." No fear occurred. Then he had her
imagine the word "cat." No fear occurred. Joe kept going up her fear
hierarchy while she relaxed, being careful to be sure she exhibited no
fear, only relaxation. Joe had her imagine a cat. Finally he brought a
cat into the consulting room and sprung it on the patient. Lo and
behold, the phobia was gone.3 This actually worked. Joe cured several
patients and showed thereby that a mere symptom of a mental illness, not
some underlying conflict, was its cause. He did it by actually curing
the mental illness and thus became the most famous heretic in the world
of psychiatry. Systematic desensitization and its first cousins are
still the treatment of choice for phobia sixty-five years later. Joe,
also a foe of apartheid, became persona non grata in his racist

homeland. He fled South Africa for Thomas Jefferson's University of
Virginia and finally settled in Philadelphia at Temple University in
1965. He and his quiet wife, Stella, held a monthly salon, and Steve and
I attended. Aside from Jim Geer, there was Arnold Lazarus (soon to be
expelled, and never forgiven, for the heresy of eclecticism---using
cognition in therapy excluded him from the ranks of pure Wolpean
therapists), Albert Stunkard (obesity researcher and the chair of
psychiatry at Penn), Aaron (Tim) Beck (soon to become the leading light
in depression), Paul Brady (who had cured stuttering behaviorally), and
more than a dozen others. We were invited to present our work on learned
helplessness. About ten minutes into our presentation, Joe---who had
been scowling since our first mention of cognition---burst in.
"Cognitive? Nonsense---your 'helpless' dogs have learned a competing
motor response. In the hammock shock goes off every so often when the
dog happens to be still. That reinforces the motor response of lying
still. In the shuttle box, when shock goes on, they lie still because
they have been rewarded for not moving before in the hammock, and they
get further reinforcement for lying still when the shock finally
terminates. So learned helplessness is completely explained by
tried-and-true behavioral principles." Steve and I had anticipated this
clever objection. In fact, it was by then the very subject of Steve's
doctoral dissertation. Like Joe, the Skinnerians proposed a
"superstitious" reinforcement explanation of helplessness. They claimed
that in the hammock, shock offset occasionally got paired accidentally
with not moving, and this "superstitiously" reinforced the association
of not moving with relief. Hence, in the shuttle box the "helpless" dogs
engaged in not moving and eventually shock ceased---further
strengthening the association between no-movement and relief. So learned
helplessness was fueled not by a cognition that actions didn't matter
but merely by good old Skinnerian response-reinforcement learning. "Joe,
make a prediction," I ventured. "Imagine that instead of accidentally
allowing just a few accidental pairings of shock offset and
motionlessness in the hammock, we go one better. We turn the shock off
only when the dog is motionless. Every time the dog is completely still
for five seconds, the shock stops. What would be learned?" "The dog will
learn to stand still, of course," Joe answered. "Now imagine we yoke
another dog to the first one, with shock going

off at exactly the same time, but independent of its responses. It might
get an occasional superstitious pairing, but which dog will have learned
the stronger competing motor response?" "The first dog," Joe said. There
are not many entirely decisive experiments in the history of science,
but this was one. Steve had run a special escapable-shock group in the
hammock: for this group shock terminated only when the dog held still,
explicitly reinforcing not moving---one-step stronger than mere
superstition. The cognitive theory predicted that these animals would
not lie still in the shuttle box since they had learned that they could
control shock---albeit by not moving, whereas behavior theory predicted
that they would show the competing response of lying still, which
according to behaviorists was all that "helplessness" amounted to. Steve
told Joe the results: all the dogs in this motionless escapableshock
group easily learned to escape in the shuttle box by jumping the
barrier. Learned helplessness was cognitive, not the competing motor
response of not moving reinforced by a few accidental shock offsets.4
QED. "They've got you by the balls, Joe!" shouted Jim merrily. Joe
conceded gracefully. He cornered me at the end of the meeting and
invited me to spend time with him at his anxiety ward to show me how
very powerful behavioral principles were in the clinic. He took me under
his wing, and I had my first actual look at mental illness. "SEE THAT
FELLOW who just walked into the men's room? Follow him in," Joe
instructed me. We were in the anxiety ward of Haverford State Hospital,
and the gentleman whom Joe told me to follow into the bathroom was
middle-aged and beautifully attired in a tailor-made dark blue suit.
"When he goes to pee, take the next urinal, unzip, and stare at him,"
Joe instructed. I did as Joe asked. Next urinal, unzip, stare. The man
peed, he zipped up, he stepped back, and so did I. Joe walked in
beaming. The gentleman threw his arms around me and exclaimed with tears
in his eyes, "You've cured me!" Joe explained. This patient had a
urinary phobia. He couldn't pee in a public restroom. He stood in front
of the urinal waiting until the room emptied out, which in his office
building could take fifteen minutes or

more. He then let go, but if anyone walked in, he froze again. His
absences had been noted, and people were gossiping about all the time he
spent in the men's room. He had been through systematic desensitization
for the last month, starting with relaxing while hearing Joe say the
word "urinate" and progressing upward through more fearful, imagined
scenarios. The acme of his fear hierarchy was actually peeing with a
stranger standing next to him and staring. He did it. He peed. Joe
asserted that the urinary phobia stemmed not from an underlying
conflict, like anxiety that he might be homosexual, that required
resolving but merely from a fear of peeing in public. The gentleman was
cured. JOE AND I became friends, and although he disagreed with me about

cognition in mental illness until the very end of his life, we found
common ground, and he held my hand on my first baby step to becoming a
clinical psychologist.

Cornell (1967--1969)

"SNOW!" EXCLAIMED KERRY, looking out the second-floor bedroom window. We
were scoping out Ithaca, guests in Jim Maas's house in Brooktondale. It
was late May 1967---hence the exclamation point. Indeed, a glaze of
new-fallen snow covered Jim's sloping lawn and his emerging crocuses.
There was snow at the beginning and more snow at the end of our time at
Cornell. I had been offered two good jobs. One was at the University of
Michigan, and at the end of my visit, I had a memorable and ominous
conversation with Norman R. F. Maier. He was in the final year of a
distinguished career and one of my heroes. His work bridged the animal
laboratory and the clinic, and he had rediscovered "experimental
neurosis" (Pavlov first named it1). Rats were taught to jump to the left
window or the right window for food, but eventually the problem became
unsolvable, and no window was consistently correct.2 The rats froze at
the starting post and became vulnerable to auditory seizures produced by
loud, high-pitched sounds. To my eye it looked like learned helplessness
in the nontraumatic, positive case. I gushed at Professor Maier, and he
blushed, seemingly quite unaccustomed to praise. "Watch your back," he
warned me in hushed tones. "No one ever cites my work. My students can't
get jobs. You have embarked on a dangerous path. What you don't know is
that the academic establishment, those pure experimental psychologists,
secretly despise our kind of work. I don't know why, but my trying to
apply experimental psychology to the clinic---as well as the existence
of the entire profession of clinical psychology---embarrasses them, or
worse." As Professor Maier was warning me, I flashed back to two recent

puzzling incidents at Penn. In Dick Solomon's Thursday lunch seminar, I
mentioned Joe Wolpe's work as a good example of straightforwardly
applying basic behavioral principles to real-world troubles. Dick, who
insouciantly applied laboratory findings to the real world in his
teaching ---but almost never in print---reacted with contempt for Joe.
He did not explain the ground for his contempt, but its vehemence was
patent and wholly out of keeping with Dick's sunny, tolerant character.
And just the week before my visit to Michigan, I had my first and only
long conversation with Bob Bush. Bob, you may recall, had led the
Harvard young Turks when they exited en masse to Penn. He was a
mathematician by training and famous for the rigorous statistical
modeling of stimulus-response-reinforcement learning. His work inspired
the new generation of aspiring mathematical psychologists. He became the
first chairman of the remade Penn department in 1958 and left the chair
to Henry Gleitman just as I arrived. I told Bob about our work on
learned helplessness and how our tests demonstrated that animals must
integrate two conditional probabilities. I emphasized that this pointed
directly to cognition and not to stimulus-response learning. He listened
patiently and clearly got it. At the end of the hour, he said, "If you
are right, Marty, I've wasted my life." Not long thereafter, Bob Bush
killed himself. He had a complicated personal life, and I have no direct
information about why, but when I heard the news, I could not help
wondering. "Watch your back, Mr. Seligman," Norman Maier concluded. "You
don't want to end up like me." Except for the awful weather, Cornell
contrasted sharply with Michigan. Its homey department had only about
twenty-five faculty members, completely dominated by one faction, the
perception psychologists led by husband and wife team Jimmy and Jackie
(Eleanor J.) Gibson. Jimmy was the brains and Jackie the enforcer. The
Gibsons were the opposite of behaviorists in ideology, but they were
just as cultish, tyrannical, and narrow-minded. They worked on the
"affordances" that the environment lends to perception. The department
had been hemorrhaging psychologists recently and was rebuilding. It made
many job offers: the recipient most distinguished was Dick Neisser, who
eagerly accepted. They tendered five assistant professorship offers, one
to me. Kerry cast the deciding vote between Michigan and Cornell. She
had

put her PhD ambitions on hold during our three years at Penn and wanted
to get on with her career. Cornell has a good classics department, so we
accepted Cornell's offer. WE RENTED A cozy sabbatical house on forty
acres of woods on Ellis

Hollow Road, east of campus, and finally I got a dog. Apollo, my blonde
golden retriever puppy, and I spent hours exploring the woods and just
sitting together outside in the cold, cuddling. My office was the
fourthfloor attic of Morrill Hall, and my laboratory, Liddell
Laboratory, a converted sheep barn, was about five miles away. My salary
was \$9,500, soon raised to an even \$10,000 through the generosity of
Harry Levin, the chairman. Harry assigned me to teach "Introduction to
Experimental Psychology." On the first day, I took a seat in the middle
of the lecture room and narcissistically relished the collective gasp
when I came to the podium and the undergraduates found that their
professor was not much older than they were. This was the first time I'd
designed and taught my very own course, and I did not do it the usual
way. I used no textbook, only original journal articles, and created my
own tour of what I considered "hot" across the discipline. My love of
psychology came across, and the students were enthralled. I chose the
topics according to my enthusiasm for them, and my enthusiasm was
contagious. Unexpectedly, this kind of teaching turned out to be a
lightning rod for my own creativity. As I lectured, I found myself
knitting together an entire area of psychology whose texture had
previously been invisible to me. Today it is known as "evolutionary
psychology." Fifty years ago it did not exist. John Garcia, a maverick
who worked on animal learning in a radiation lab, had published a
two-page article that went almost unnoticed for two years.3 When I first
read it---and it was so badly written that I had to read it three
times---I felt the earth move, but until I taught about the article, I
did not fully understand why. As I recounted the history of behaviorism
to my students, I began to see that it was a rock-bottom premise of
learning theory that John Garcia had obliterated. When John B. Watson,
the founder of behaviorism, famously wrote, "Give me a dozen healthy
infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and
I'll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any
type of specialist I might

select---doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief, and, yes, even
beggarman and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies,
abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors,"4 the political and
scientific appeal was electric. This justified the egalitarian social
program that underpinned American democracy as well as the Bolshevik and
French revolutions. "Pavlov and Skinner," I recounted to my
undergraduates, "believed fervently in 'equipotentiality,' the idea that
any stimulus that is paired in time with any other stimulus will produce
learning." "Hold on, Marty," objected Susan Mineka, a sophomore who
twentyfive years later became editor of the Journal of Abnormal
Psychology. "It can't be any old stimulus. The animal has to perceive it
and respond to it."5 "Of course, Sue. But the crucial point is that
these are exactly the associations that David Hume and John Locke argued
make up the experience that writes on the blank slate," I continued,
making a mental note to invite this very bright sophomore into my
laboratory. "It is just this flexibility of the brain that with the
right experience will make of any man or woman a genius, the president
of the United States, or a bigoted ignoramus." I decided to ease into
the complicated Garcia experiment with an anecdote that captured its
essence, and this juxtaposition of anecdote and hard data later became
the hallmark of my teaching and writing. "Sauce béarnaise," I told my
class, "is an egg-thickened tarragonflavored concoction that used to be
my favorite sauce. A few months ago, my wife and I had a delicious meal
of filet mignon with sauce béarnaise. About three hours later, I got
sick to my stomach, so sick that Kerry had to take me to the emergency
ward to get an injection to stop my vomiting. I now hate the taste of
this sauce. Just thinking about it--- right now---sets my teeth on edge.
"Strangely," I continued, "filet mignon did not become aversive, nor did
my wife, nor did Tristan and Isolde, the opera I was listening to right
before throwing up. Only the sauce did. What's going on?" "It's just
Pavlovian conditioning, Marty," said one of the students. "The taste was
paired with throwing up. Now the taste makes you sick to your stomach."
"Anything wrong with that?" "Plenty," piped up Jim Johnston, a member of
Cornell's elite,

experimental six-year BA-PhD program. "First, Marty learned with just
one trial, and conditioning takes more pairings than that. And there was
a three-hour gap between the taste and throwing up. I'll bet if Marty
wired up your chair, played a tone, and three hours later shocked your
butt, you would not become afraid of the tone. Second, Tristan and the
beef didn't become nauseating even though they were just as well-paired
with vomiting. The toilet seat was even closer in time to vomiting, and
do toilet seats now make Marty sick?" Wow, I thought to myself, Jim is
amazing. He spoke in full paragraphs with no "uhs" or "likes." Jim would
go on within a decade to become one of America's leading young cognitive
scientists. "Let me tell you all about the Garcia 'double-dissociation'
experiment," I continued. "Garcia works in a radiation lab and he gives
X-rays to rats, which makes them sick to their stomachs. A few seconds
before receiving the X-ray, the rats drink saccharin-tasting water, and
with each lick they hear a loud tone. Good old Pavlovian condition,
right? Both the sweet taste and the tone are paired with sickness. Later
Garcia finds that the rats now hate sweet tastes but are completely
unperturbed by the tone. "Maybe the rats just didn't notice the tone. So
Garcia now does the same experiment, but with shock to the feet as the
bad event rather than radiation sickness: loud tone plus sweet taste are
both paired with foot shock. Now the rats come to fear the tone, but
they still love sweet tastes! So they could perceive the tone after all.
What is learned selects the 'right' conditional stimulus, depending on
what kind of noxious event follows. Stomach illness selects for tastes
and ignores the tone. Foot shock selects the tone and ignores the taste.
"Why?" I asked. The class looked puzzled. "What would Darwin have said
about Garcia?" As I thought over my education, nothing stood out as more
egregious than third-form biology at the Albany Academy a decade
earlier. F. Norton (Skippy) Curtis marched us through species, genus,
phylum, and kingdom but omitted one thing: natural selection. I suppose
he can be forgiven since it had been only a century since the
publication of On the Origin of Species and the news may have traveled
slowly up the Hudson River to Albany. We had pop quizzes, the most
memorable question being "Name the authors of your textbook." None of
the forty-seven of us third formers got that one right (Moon, Mann, and
Otto), but the name

Mr. Curtis never mentioned was Charles Darwin. When I first heard the
principles of evolution from Colin Pittendrigh in my introductory
biology course at Princeton (Pittendrigh's own textbook), I lived
through a thunderbolt of just the sort that must have shaken the fellows
of the Royal Society in 1859. Natural selection reframes almost
everything, and it has pervaded my thinking about psychology since. But
like Skippy Curtis's students, learning theory also missed out on
evolution. How else could equipotentiality have remained a first
principle? Could learning itself be just as subject to evolution as the
makeup of the eye and the ear? In the reality of mammalian evolution,
distinctive tastes herald poisonous stomach illness, but sounds do not.
Animals that could ignore external stimuli but selectively learn that
tastes go together with illness---even with just one experience---would
avoid those tastes in the future, survive, and pass on the genes that
allowed such selection. Animals that could selectively associate sounds
with pain and ignore cooccurring tastes would have a similar survival
edge. "Consider the evolutionary basis of learning itself," I told my
class. "Learning that mirrors the actual causal skein of the world will
be favored and selected. Evolution may have prepared us to associate
tastes with illness even over a several-hour gap. Evolution may have
contraprepared us to associate external events, like sounds, with
stomach illness." My two teaching assistants, Meredith West and Drew
King, chimed in. They had been studying birds over in the biology
department. "It's not just mammals that learn so selectively. Birds
learn to sing in just the same way. They selectively imitate the songs
of their parents and not the songs of bypassing strangers. And human
language is like this too. This is at the heart of Chomsky's theory that
language is a species-specific human adaptation. Babies show 'babbling
drift,' the accent of their babbling drifting in the direction of their
parent's language." Drew and Meredith were already an item and they went
on to become world-class avian ethologists together. Out of this course
a Psychological Review article and my very first book, The Biological
Boundaries of Learning,6 written with my graduate student Joanne Hager,
emerged, as did a snide comment from the behaviorists calling my sauce
béarnaise story the "most publicized meal since the Last Supper." Most
importantly, I joined the battle against the

"blank slate" brand of psychology that ignores natural selection and
insists that while having a brain is nice, that brain is just a means of
faithfully transcribing what experience writes. CORNELL NOT ONLY
stimulated my creative juices but became a political

hotbed as well. I got my first taste when I volunteered to serve on the
undergraduate admissions committee. This was huge fun, particularly for
me, since I liked spotting brilliant prodigies, such as stars like Jim
Johnston and Sue Mineka, for admission into the six-year BA-PhD
experiment. Toward this end, each faculty admission committee member got
wild cards---applicants we could admit based on just our lone vote--- if
we agreed to mentor them through Cornell. But President James Perkins
played a wilder card than any faculty member had. The issue was black
admissions. The Black Student Association was agitating loudly for more
black students, and we were very sympathetic ---this in the first blush
of enthusiasm for Lyndon Johnson's vision of affirmative action. We had
been bending over backward to take more and more black applicants. We
reached deep into a small pool---students that all the Ivies were
competing fiercely for---and we were hopeful that lots of academic
talent might lie hidden beneath low Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)
scores and low grades, particularly when the kid came from a poor
neighborhood and a fatherless family. So we took lots of chances,
admitting kids who showed glimmers of promise, particularly high
determination in overcoming obstacles, even if they had mediocre high
school grades and low SATs. But we still were not keeping pace with the
administration's quota for black students, and an order came down from
President Perkins. We didn't hear from on high often, and the only other
communication we'd had from him had been a cause for hilarity: I was
going through a folder of a potential freshman from the Bronx and stuck
upside down in it was a letter on the president's stationery to the head
of Knight Newspapers as well as the original letter to which it was a
response. The Knight person endorsed a woman applying for the PhD
program (this had nothing to do with undergraduate admissions), and
President Perkins's letter reassured him that his letter would "not get
lost in the shuffle." The present order was not a cause for hilarity,
and it would not get lost in the shuffle. We were instructed to take 100
percent of black

applicants whose SATs averaged 600 or better. The SAT is a barely
concealed and more publicly acceptable surrogate for the IQ test,
correlating almost perfectly with IQ scores. An average of 600 was near
the seventieth percentile for all college-bound applicants across
America, and we were pretty much already admitting all black applicants
in this range. No problem. We were further instructed to take 60 percent
of all black applicants whose SATs averaged 500 or better, somewhat
below the fiftieth percentile for all applicants. This was a push, but
we guessed we could comply. And then came the wildest card in the pack.
We were instructed to take 40 percent of all black applicants with an
SAT average of 400 or better. This was the bottom 25 percent of the
entire American pool. (Do you see the problem before you read on?) "Hold
on," said my fellow faculty committee member Thomas Sowell. Tom was a
sober black economist who later became famous for his courageous take on
the miseducation of young black kids.7 He pointed out a gaping
statistical anomaly to us. "Think about the bottom 40 percent of the
pool of kids who average 500, the half we are instructed to reject. Such
a kid might score 530 on average. What we are now told to do is to
discriminate against this kid in favor of kids who score in the upper 40
percent over 400, say 460 on average. We are told to favor less talented
(460) black kids over a large number of more talented (530) black kids.
President Perkins's theory seems to be that the lower the IQ, the more
deprived and deserving the applicant is." "I quit," Tom said, and he
did. He left both the admissions committee and Cornell, but the
admissions committee and Cornell continued to knuckle under. This
foreshadowed the racial politics soon to come. "HOW CAN YOU possibly
claim that there are more than 10,000 advanced

technical civilizations in the galaxy?" I challenged the brash,
confident, and outspoken new arrival at the astronomy department. We
were at a welcome dinner given by Bob and Jennifer Schneider. Bob taught
calculus, and Jenny was jaw-droppingly beautiful---so beautiful that in
Bertolt Brecht's The Good Woman of Szechuan, she played the daughter,
and at the serious line "Am I pretty, Mother?" the audience actually
broke into gales of laughter. The new arrival had left the astronomy
department at Harvard bitterly, denied tenure, and was holding forth
unstoppably about intelligent life. He was strikingly handsome, gifted

with a deep, mellifluous voice, and spoke in cogent full paragraphs. His
name was Carl Sagan. "I just wrote a long book about how widespread
intelligent life must be with the Russian astronomer Shklovskii, Marty,"
he replied handing me a copy. "Read it." And I did. I stayed up for the
next twenty-four hours digesting his argument. The book culminated in a
"qualitative equation" (I had not heard this term before), the Drake
Equation, named after Frank Drake, a senior member of our astronomy
department. On the left-hand side was "the number of advanced technical
civilizations in this galaxy," meaning civilizations that used radio
waves for communication. On the right-hand side were the estimates for
more than ten parameters to be multiplied together, such as the number
of Sol-like stars in the galaxy, the percentage of those with planets,
the percentage of those with planets far enough away from the star to be
temperate, the percentage of those with atmospheres, and the longevity
of an intelligent civilization (which was bimodal, either short and
destroying itself right away or wise and long). The solution blew my
mind: there are, right now, between 10,000 and 2 million advanced
technical civilizations just in our galaxy.

Carl Sagan arrived at Cornell in 1968, rejected for tenure in astronomy
at Harvard. We became fast friends. Carl embodied the responsibility of
science to communicate effectively with the public, even at the cost of
professional jealousy. Photo courtesy of Getty Images.

Understanding the human mind and the search for intelligent life in the
universe were for me the two grandest of scientific pursuits. I chose

the former for my life's work because my mathematical skills for
astronomy were not good enough. In Sagan, I met someone respectable who
had chosen the latter. We became fast friends and began to spend huge
swaths of time together. We read each other's manuscripts. He gave me an
early draft of his Dragons of Eden, a book about the brain. The
psychology in it was too sloppy, and I advised him not to publish it. It
won the Pulitzer Prize. We swapped books that we read overnight and then
discussed over breakfast. "Read this one, Carl," I insisted. "It might
change your mind about truth." I handed him the latest rage in the
philosophy of science, Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific
Revolutions.8 Kuhn argued that science was more about fashion than about
absolute truth. He contended that in any current science, a "paradigm"
dictated the right questions and created a hegemony of silence about
those that should not be asked. The old guys died off, and the new guys
then came along and swept away the old paradigm, replacing it with their
own new paradigm. This sure looked right to me for psychology.
Behaviorism swept away introspection, and now cognition was sweeping
away behaviorism. Kuhn had created a sensation, and it fit the
relativism that was just starting to overtake the humanities, as English
and history departments started to switch from Shakespeare and Columbus
to a focus on race, class, and gender. The next morning over very strong
coffee at Carl and his wife Linda's apartment, Carl told me, "This is
about bad science, Marty. Good science makes absolute predictions that
can be proved or disproved. Good science is about the truth, not about
fads. There are two theories about the origin of our solar system. One
predicts that the moon is covered with a deep layer of dust. The other
predicts that the moon's surface is solid. Next year we will find out
for sure." We watched the moon landing together at the faculty club.
Neil Armstrong did not sink into a layer of dust. "That's good science,"
Carl said with finality. Carl had saved a book to read aloud to me for a
very special occasion. Kerry and I were expecting our first child. Kerry
went into labor, and I started our Buick and pointed it toward the
Tompkins County Hospital eight miles away. Mindlessly, I then just let
it idle in the driveway for six hours, and the car ran out of gas. Carl
came to the rescue with a can of

gas. After another twelve hours, the four of us raced off to the
hospital, where Linda held my hand, and Carl read from J. B. S.
Haldane's essays on science. Amanda Seligman was safely delivered in the
wee hours of a spring morning in 1969. CARL AND I experienced together
the assassination of Martin Luther King

Jr. and Robert Kennedy, the exit of Lyndon Johnson from the presidency,
and the black revolution at Cornell. We both started out left of center
and reacted to the same events in diametrically opposite ways. In the
middle of all this, however, we had a personal rupture that was not
about politics but about Carl's physical health. Carl had a ferocious
temper and was easily offended. Kerry and I gave a dinner party in which
Carl and L. Pearce Williams, a noted historian, faced off about the
Boxer Rebellion. Williams sided with the imperialists and Carl with the
Chinese. At first the mention of "yellow peril," Carl stomped out,
shaking his fist at Pearce. I had managed to stay on Carl's good side up
until then. Carl was going off to Boston for the first of the surgeries
on his esophagus stemming from a rare cancer that would eventually kill
him at the tragically young age of sixty-two. Kerry and I supplied Carl
with our dozen favorite science fiction classics to read. Carl had never
read any science fiction, saying that real science was much more
interesting. But he agreed to read them during his recuperation and
emerged from the hospital with the idea that became his novel, Contact.9
Linda called me from the hospital right after surgery and told me that
Carl was in critical condition. "You might give blood," Linda suggested.
About six of our students and I drove to the donation center. I fainted
while giving blood, and the doctor warned me never to do it again, but
we did manage to donate a few pints. Within hours, Carl called me from
his hospital bed. He was shouting, beside himself with fury. "My illness
was a secret. You betrayed me and told my students." I'd had no clue.
Carl recovered rapidly, but we would never be close again. MY ACADEMIC
WORK was going superwell. Steve Maier and I had found

that learned helplessness was temporary: twenty-four hours after
inescapable shock, the animals remained helpless, but if we waited a
full week, the animals had recovered and escaped shock in the shuttle
box

easily. Then I found a condition under which learned helplessness was
permanent. If animals had not just one but multiple sessions of
inescapable shock, helplessness did not go away in time.10 Word of our
work was spreading. I had been offered an assistant professorship at
Harvard. My chairman, Harry Levin, mocked the offer: "Every Jewish boy
wants to be at Harvard." He hit the target and shamed me, and so I
turned Harvard down. Steve Maier had taken a plum assistant
professorship at Illinois. Princeton offered me an endowed bicentennial
preceptorship, which came with an assistant mastership at my beloved
Woodrow Wilson Society under Julian Jaynes, a former teacher. This dream
offer from my alma mater was very tempting, but Dick Solomon told me to
wait, saying many more offers would come my way. I turned Princeton
down. (Many more offers did not come my way and never again from my
beloved Princeton.) I was initiated into the Psychological Round Table,
a secret fraternity of haughty under-forty male experimental
psychologists. It met once a year in a New York City mansion, and each
member delivered a scholarly paper interlaced with humor. I was the
youngest and least humorous initiate and worried that when they
discovered my loyalty to applied psychology, I would be expelled. Dave
Williams reported on Wilhelm Wundt: "Wundt was so disciplined that he
wrote two thousand words every day for his entire career. Eighty-eight
volumes in total. And in German. The last four volumes were all verbs."
Tenure was all but certain at Cornell. My courses were oversubscribed. I
had a large coterie of enthusiastic undergraduates working in my
laboratory and a passel of sleepier graduate students. Senior professors
from across the university invited me onto the right committees. They
seemed to be grooming me for higher Cornell office. I had just received
my first grant from the National Institute of Mental Health for research
on learned helplessness. "YOU REALLY DON'T know anything about clinical
psychology, do you?"

said Suzanne Bennett Johnson. Suzanne was a perky, freckle-faced senior
and not at all intimidated. She got a rare A+ in my experimental
psychology course, and I invited her into my laboratory, where she
continued to shine. Cornell, being without a medical school, did not
teach about mental illness, and I was now offering an advanced course on
psychopathology---even though I was a novice. Suzanne was taking

this course and saw my ignorance right away. She would become a clinical
psychologist working on juvenile diabetes and was elected president of
the American Psychological Association in 2012. "You have us reading
about learned helplessness and experimental neurosis in animals. Rats?
Dogs? But what about people? What about schizophrenia, drug addiction,
manic depression, and suicide?" chimed in Chris Risley, another senior
not intimidated by me. (This "Marty" stuff had perhaps gone too far.) On
the first day of my experimental psychology course two years before,
Chris, a wet-behind-the-ears sophomore, came bouncing into my office,
beaming. "Hi, Marty. My name is Chris Risley. You should get to know me.
I am really worth getting to know!" No undergraduate, before or since,
has approached me in this bold way, and Chris turned out to be right. We
became good friends, and he and Suzanne spent much of their time with
Kerry and me at our house eight miles west of campus. Our house was now
the watering hole for a dozen of my students. When two of my best
students, Suzanne and Chris, who were also now my close friends, told me
that I didn't know what I was talking about, I listened. They told me to
get into the trenches and learn something about real mental illness. I
intended to take time off to learn clinical psychology, but such a
profession barely existed. Psychiatry was the only profession that
officially treated mental illness, and it was a guild that did not
readily open its doors to people who were not medical doctors. Qualified
psychologists were not welcomed and were allowed to enter only as
handmaidens and supervisees of psychiatrists. Furthermore, I was not
qualified to treat patients, and there was no well-charted trail for an
experimental psychologist like me to follow to retool as a clinical
psychologist. I was, however, about to have one blazed for me.

"CLINTON ROSSITER IS a racist and will die in the gutter like a dog.
Allan Sindler is a racist and will die in the gutter like a dog. Walter
Berns..."

The litany went on, naming the faculty members who were to die. (I was
not among them, being far too junior, obscure, and apolitical to be
noticed by the leaders of the increasingly frenzied Black Liberation
Front.) This was our local campus radio station, and the speaker was Tom
Jones, Class of 1969, president of the group. Tom was a shapeshifter and
somehow later shed his radical skin with a huge "gift" to Cornell in
1995. He went on to become the head of TIAA-CREF, the custodians,
ironically, of my retirement money. But his threats were not hollow.
Clinton Rossiter committed suicide. Allan Sindler and Walter Berns left
Cornell. Physical assaults on faculty went unreported in the newspaper,
but we heard about them at the Faculty Club. Black students, protesting
his teachings about poverty, wrestled the microphone away from an
economics lecturer, then walked in and took over the economics
department. They went unpunished. Fire swept through the six-year BAPhD
program dormitory, and eight of the students died of asphyxiation. It
seemed to have been arson, and this marvelous program was aborted, but
the case was never solved. Charles Thomas, one of my advisees, told me
that female black students chased him down and stuck him with pins for
the crime of dating white girls. IT WAS PARENTS' WEEKEND, April 1969. I
reverted to my Quiz Kid role and

was named captain of the Faculty College Bowl team. We planned to face
off against four undergraduates to see who could answer trivia questions
fastest. The contest was aborted as news of heavily armed black students
swept the campus. The epicenter was Willard Straight Hall. A parent had
either jumped from a window or been defenestrated, with at least a
broken leg as a result. Bristling with rifles and ammunition, a large
group of black students entered Willard Straight, threatened all those
inside, and forcibly ejected them. They were now occupying the building,
and the photo of the armed black students entering the Straight flashed
around the world. The 1960s revolution had come to the Ivy League.
Rumors flew. A group of armed vigilantes was gathering near campus to
retake the Straight from the "niggers and commie Jews." President
Perkins's dog had been kidnapped. They had threatened to kill President
Perkins's children. They had threatened to kill President Perkins. What
did the black students want? Their demands were nebulous---more black
faculty members, more black students, more black scholarships---but one

"nonnegotiable" demand stood out: amnesty.

mounting intimidation against whites and nonmilitant blacks, members of
the Afro-American Society violently took possession of the student
union. This led me to quit my job at Cornell. Photo courtesy of Cornell
Library.

The administration trembled. The faculty trembled. Emergency faculty
meetings were held, and the meetings broke all attendance records. Max
Black, the universally respected silverback of the philosophy
department, urged, "When in doubt, stand on principle." The faculty
declined and voted to give the black students whatever they wanted, and
most certainly, amnesty. A minority of the faculty, including me, was
scandalized. Relinquishing the freedom to teach what one believes,
giving in to violence, allocating scarce resources to the loudest group
for academically dubious projects like the Ujamaa Residential
College---this was not what a university was about. A "Committee of 41"
was formed and included the most distinguished of the centrist members
of the faculty: Nobelist Hans Bethe, Paul Olum (later president of the
University of Texas), Fred Kahn (later dean of the faculty), Max Black,
and Dale Corson (who soon succeeded President Perkins). I was the
forty-first, the token junior faculty member. The senior notables told
me that they saw me as a future dean, someone who believed in
traditional

academic values. I did not see myself as a future dean or university
president (my mother, however, would have loved me to have those roles),
but I was honored to join their cause. Carl Sagan did not join. From
identical experiences, he had moved far left, and I had become markedly
more conservative. What I most valued in a university--- arguably the
best human institution ever created---needed defenders. The last straw
for me happened in my experimental psychology course. I'd prepared a
lecture on intelligence. Arthur Jensen, a distinguished Berkeley
professor of education, had recently published a well-reasoned but
explosively controversial article in the Harvard Educational Review.11
He argued that IQ was heritable and that the IQ difference between
American blacks and whites was genetic. He cited a bushel of evidence,
such as the IQ gap remaining constant at every level of income. Jensen
was vilified in the press. The ordinarily disinterested New York Times's
railing against Jensen notwithstanding, this was a very complex issue
with serious arguments and counterarguments on both sides. It was also
certainly a topic that would engage the students to come to grips with
behavioral genetics. As I began my lecture, I noticed that several of my
black students appeared to be scowling at me from the back row. I was
afraid. I even trembled. I stumbled on, omitting all mention of race and
heritability. I was intimidated. I knew that the time for me to leave
Cornell had come. I voted with my feet.

Chapter Nine

Penn Psychiatry (1970--1972)

"NOOOO," BURBLED AMANDA from the car seat. "SNOOOOW," corrected Kerry.
"Look at all that snow." On either side of the road as we sped away down
Van Ostrand Road, snowdrifts stood taller than the car. It was the last
day of a turbulent decade: December 31, 1969. I was leaving Cornell. As
we drove out of Ithaca, I congratulated myself for showing at least a
shred of courage. I thought about Adrian at just my age. Forty years
before, faced with the Great Depression, he had been afraid. He decided
to forgo possible fortune and fame for a lifetime of financial security.
I guessed I had more backbone, but I was staring at joblessness. So I
was driving our pale yellow bottom-of-the-line Buick, fleeing from a
badly broken university. But I was also heading for something positive.
ALBERT STUNKARD AND Tim Beck had blazed a trail for me to learn some

real psychopathology back at Penn in the psychiatry department. Albert
was called "Mickey," I guess because of his Mickey Mouse outsize ears.
In the mid-1960s, with Tim Beck at his right hand, Mickey had wrested
control of the psychiatry department from the psychoanalysts and had
since been busy reshaping this huge, amorphous department. He was
determined to build a field of research-based psychiatry with Penn at
the center. Mickey saw me as a possible recruit and rescued me from
joblessness and poverty. He found private donors to support my stay at
Penn, and Louise Harper, a generous Washington socialite, pledged
\$10,000. So Mickey offered me a two-year psychiatric residency to train
in psychiatry. I went on to learn about mental illness firsthand and was
given the strange, long title of "visiting associate professor of

psychology in psychiatry." Tim Beck was my mentor. I was twentyseven,
and Tim suggested that I grow a beard to try to look as old as my fellow
residents. I was given an office in the psychiatry department and spent
the next two years on the inpatient and outpatient floors of the
ramshackle University of Pennsylvania Hospital. Henry Bachrach, a PhD
psychologist, was director of residency training and my first therapy
supervisor. His high training position was an encouraging sign of how
well Mickey and Tim's regime tolerated psychologists. I did not know
about Henry's biases, but I soon found out. "Marty, you'll never believe
what I just heard about Arnold Lazarus." Arnold, you may recall, was the
behavior therapist expelled from Joe Wolpe's inner circle for
introducing cognition into Joe's orthodox behavior therapy. "A patient
came to see him, worrying that his penis was too small," Henry
continued. "Well, let's measure it," Arnold said. After a few seconds of
silence, I realized that this was a punch line, and I was supposed to
laugh. I chuckled, but the gulf between the old Freudians and the new
cognitive behaviorists had never seemed more unbridgeable. I was
decidedly nervous about seeing my first real patient, but Henry
reassured me. "You're smart, Marty. Don't forget you have that edge, but
never take a patient who is smarter than you." My first patient may not
have been smarter than I was, but he was slyer. Jerry, in his early
twenties, was a mustachioed, ghostly pale college dropout. He was
markedly depressed according to the standard symptom checklist, which I
made a habit of using early in therapy. His eyes were downcast, he told
me tearful stories of one failure after another, and his speech and gait
were painfully slow. He told me he had just shaved his head. When I
asked Henry about head shaving, he told me that it was a textbook red
flag for suicide, although quite unproven. I saw Jerry once a week,
using the new moves that Tim Beck was in the process of inventing with
his residents for what would soon be called the "cognitive therapy" of
depression.

Aaron Temkin (Tim) Beck and I first met in 1967. Tim was my principal
teacher of psychopathology, particularly depression. A model of how to
age, Tim turned ninety-six in July 2017. I still have the privilege of a
once-a-month research lunch with him. Photo courtesy of Aaron Beck.

After three months, Jerry appeared at my office without an appointment.
Bright-eyed, brisk of gait, tan, and normal of speech for the first
time, he was grinning broadly. His hair was growing back. My very

first case is a success. This new cognitive therapy sure works wonders,
I thought to myself. "I am here to terminate," Jerry gushed, "but I want
to thank you for all you did. Particularly for the letter you wrote to
my draft board about my depression. They have reclassified me 4-F. No
Vietnam for me!" Tim Beck and I met once a week with Igor Grant, the
chief resident, and Dean Schuyler to discuss our cases from the point of
view of the new cognitive theory of depression---that depression stems
from thoughts of loss---which Tim advanced in 1967.1 These meetings were
the seedbed from which cognitive therapy emerged five years later.2 Dean
was the most acute teacher of therapy I'd ever had. Tim formulated the
abstractions---for example, "That's an automatic thought about her
husband's never reciprocating"---but Dean hit the nail on the head with
the concreta: "When she gives him a Hershey bar, he never gives her back
a Baby Ruth." Igor kept us focused on the case, and I sat in deep
respect for their different skills, skills uncommon in the airy world of
psychology departments. I contributed by extrapolating the current
scientific literature to the cases: for example, that childhood
experience with helplessness should lead to automatic thoughts of being
a victim and a loser. Tim called himself "Mr. Outside" and me
"Mr. Inside," using a West Point football metaphor to say that he viewed
his theories as far out, while mine were nestled cozily inside academia.
That was not my view, however, since I also saw myself as an iconoclast.
MY TWO YEARS of clinical training left me with an open, even a credulous

mind about therapy and what causes mental illness. By the end of my
residency in 1972, I believed that large swaths of mental illness were
straightforward. Unfortunate Pavlovian conditioning, maladaptive
instrumental habits, debilitating automatic thoughts, learned
helplessness, stunted social skills, malign genetics, and neural
imbalance were at play. The new cognitive and behavior therapies seemed
useful here. And never to be derided or ignored was a big "placebo"
benefit: to the extent a disorder involved the loss of hope, entering
therapy in and of itself provided some. Often patients just needed a
supportive, nonjudgmental listener. Therefore eclectic techniques in the
hands of a skilled therapist would do considerable good. But I also
believed that deep, mysterious forces were at play that we

had barely glimpsed, and in the hands of a witchy therapist, dramatic
relief could come. By the end of my residency I came to regard the human
psyche and its deformations as objects of awe. While my professional
life was expanding, my parents' lives were crumbling.

Adrian had not been expected to survive his strokes, but he had an
unbreakable will to live, still on display fifteen years later. He had
been kept on at the Court of Appeals and, with enormous determination,
had returned to work as deputy state reporter within the year. He would
always be paralyzed on his left side and was but a shadow of his former
self intellectually. He was also emotionally labile, and I often saw him
burst into tears. All this made him an object of pity at the office, and
I was sure he knew it. By the time I finished college, he'd cashed in
his generous disability pension and decamped to an apartment in Miami
Beach. Irene and Adrian had been squabbling more and more, and she
stayed in Albany. They talked of separation, but it never became
official. Irene was relieved when Adrian moved to Florida and he was out
of her hair. She continued her job as the head stenographer for an
office full of New York State lawyers. Her many "girls" there prized her
as fairminded and turned to her for wise advice. But her arthritis
became severe, and by the time I left college, I'd seen her at her
worst, on all fours crawling up two flights of stairs to the bedroom,
unable to walk. We drove up to Lake Luzerne one rainy autumn afternoon,
and she told me that she had expected the last third of her life to be
"golden years." She tearfully confessed that they were far from it.
Watching my parents' marriage fall apart and their health deteriorate
made me feel helpless and sad. I thought about my own work on
helplessness, and search as I might, I found no answers. I was good at
compartmentalizing, however, and had my own consuming work and a growing
family to distract me. But things got worse. Adrian flew up from Florida
to visit Kerry and me and to meet his grandchild. While this gave him
some pleasure, he was morose and talked of suicide. As I drove to the
supermarket, he threw open the door of the speeding car and made the
gesture of throwing himself out. I yanked the door closed but knew that
this was beyond anything I could handle. I checked him into the
inpatient psychiatry ward of Philadelphia General Hospital, where on
heavy tranquilizers he regained some

stability. I was mortified to have to turn my own father over to the
care of my colleagues. A few days later, I drove him to the airport, and
he flew back to Florida. This was the last time I saw my father. MY
RESEARCH TOOK a decided turn toward mental illness in humans. I

began looking for point-to-point mapping between learned helplessness in
the lab and depression in the clinic. The question I had asked Jim Geer
five years before, "What is depression?" was now getting answered with
some welcome precision, and this was a sea change in psychiatry. Tim
Beck's Beck Depression Inventory, published in 1961, was now in widening
use. It asked patients to report on a zero-to-three scale the severity
of each of twenty-one symptoms of depression. Now these symptoms were
being codified into a diagnosis of depression in what would soon become
DSM-3, the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the
American Psychiatric Association. The categories began as mere research
tools that made their way in draft around the scientific end of the
therapy community. This community was trying to get some purchase on a
very slippery thing: diagnostic agreement from hospital to hospital.
What was called schizophrenia in New York City was often called manic
depression in London. Without consistent diagnostic agreement, serious
research on therapy could not even start. Depression was a fine test
case. As codified in the new diagnostic manual, depression was sensibly
split in two. Bipolar depression (manic depression) involved moods that
alternated over long periods from irrationally high to extremely low.
Unipolar depression had only lows, broken down into nine symptoms: • Sad
mood • Loss of interest • Weight loss • Sleep problems • Psychomotor
problems • Fatigue • Feelings of worthlessness • Indecisiveness or poor
concentration • Thoughts of suicide

"Those dogs are depressed," Jim had said, and I now thought about the
formal requirements if learned helplessness was truly a model of
unipolar depression in patients. A laboratory model had great advantages
for science. It could allow systematic exploration of what drugs and
what therapies would work in depression. So I began a research program
to pin down the parallels. Ultimately I found that learned helplessness
induced experimentally mapped to eight of the nine symptoms, the only
exception being suicide and suicidal thoughts---an unlikely symptom for
mild bad events to produce in the laboratory. Not only did inescapable
shock and inescapable noise produce the symptoms of depression, but the
converse occurred as well: depressed people who did not experience
inescapable events behaved in the laboratory as if they had, showing
passivity in the shuttle box and giving up on cognitive problems.3 My
other niche in academic psychology was biological constraints on
learning, and the heavyweight Psychological Review published the fruits
of my undergraduate lectures.4 The blank slate view of learning had
exerted a dead hand on the theory of mental illness, and I began to
wonder if biological constraints applied to mental illness just as they
did to learning. Phobias fit. Recall John Garcia's finding that rats
learned in one trial, and retained over long delays, a sense that a
distinctive taste goes with stomach illness but distinctive sounds do
not. This made very good evolutionary sense, and other features of
prepared learning also stared me in the face. Unlike ordinary Pavlovian
conditioning, taste aversions do not go away. I still hated the taste of
sauce béarnaise a good five years after the incident. Furthermore,
Pavlovian conditioning appeared cognitive. Bob Rescorla was gathering
mounting evidence that conditioning was just an expectation (e.g., that
a shock would follow the tone), thus a rational cognition that mirrored
accurately the real contingencies of the world.5 But taste aversions
crept under the cognitive radar. Once I had recovered from my seeming
food poisoning, I found out that a flu had swept through the lab. So I
knew that the sauce had not caused my illness, but that did not weaken
my distaste. Phobias look a lot like prepared learning. First, they are
highly selective for objects that long ago in our primate history were
common and dangerous: snakes, spiders, lightning storms, strangers, the
dark, and going outside alone, for example. And despite their modern,
but not ancient, dangerousness, there do not exist knife phobias or
electric outlet phobias. A young girl sees a snake in a park in England
(quite unusual

for that country) and a bit later goes back to the family car and has
her hand smashed in the car door. She develops a lifelong fear of...
snakes but not car doors. Also phobias don't extinguish readily and are
decidedly irrational--- merely knowing that you will not jump or be
pushed off the cliff does not remotely stifle your fear of heights. And
so I extended my work on preparedness to phobias and
obsessive-compulsive disorders, arguing that as a species we are
evolutionarily prepared for them and the objects they focus on and that
some individuals might be more genetically vulnerable to specific
disorders than others.6 I was not yet thirty, and these two
contributions attracted considerable academic notice. Mickey and Tim
asked if I might be willing to stay on in the psychiatry department. I
was aware, however, that medical departments in America had very shaky
funding. There was almost no "hard" money (Mickey had the only assured
salary out of his two hundred faculty members), and so, for the research
professors who populated the great departments, salaries depended almost
entirely on either getting large federal grants or seeing patients, the
latter generally dreaded. This meant that psychiatry departments, just
to survive, were in a never-ending scramble to keep up with the latest
trends that were popular in Congress. In fact, the National Institute of
Mental Health (NIMH) had by this time, despite its "health" charter,
become the National Institute of Mental Illness, and it was the sole
institution that kept the great psychiatry departments from bankruptcy.
So having a tenured appointment in a psychiatry department amounted to
having a concession stand to try to absorb federal funds, and if that
failed... you were "tenured" but with no salary. Mickey had a scheme for
me. The NIMH had just started granting "Career Scientist Awards," a way
of supporting research scientists by paying their salaries within
psychiatry departments for at least five years. Mickey and Tim urged me
to apply, and I did, proposing a program of research to test whether
learned helplessness was indeed a model of unipolar depression and
whether it captured some or even all forms of these depressions. The
institute received my proposal warmly, and a "site visit" was arranged.
Four of America's leading psychiatrists assembled at Penn to spend a day
grilling me. We were on the same wavelength, and it went swimmingly. But
there was a joker in the pack, and he was scowling at me. He was

a psychologist from Harvard named Bill Morse, an acolyte of B. F.
Skinner. He had discovered that when shocked, monkeys "chain-rattled"
neurotically, and he and Skinner argued that this was "all in the
schedule"---code for the dogma that the environment shaped behavior
entirely, and cognition and evolution played no role at all. Morse
challenged me, and I was fearless enough to give an evolutionary
explanation of his very findings and then to reject the Skinnerian
notion of "superstition" as an explanation of learned helplessness. I
cited Steve Maier's crucial "holding still" experiment. A visibly
exasperated Morse silently continued to scowl. When the group
reassembled in Washington, I later learned, the four psychiatrists all
gave my application a "1.0," the highest NIMH score, equivalent to an
A+. Morse asked the group, "What mark do I have to give Seligman to
prevent him from getting any money?" They told him a "5.0," the almost
never-used equivalent of an F. He did, and I now take this opportunity
to thank Bill Morse for unintentionally doing me one of the great favors
of my life. In parallel with this, the University of Pennsylvania's
psychology department was considering appointing me with tenure.
Psychology departments, unlike psychiatry departments, were "hard"
money, with the (generally much lower) salary secure for life, even
without soliciting grant support or seeing patients. Indeed, this was
the financial basis of "academic freedom," the freedom to write what one
will, no matter how unpopular. The Penn psychology department's
considering me was almost unprecedented, since the last Penn PhD granted
tenure was Frank Irwin, four decades before. Tenured appointments, it
was sensibly argued, should come from the outside to avoid
nachschleppers and so bring in new blood. On the favorable side, there
was a push for clinical and abnormal psychology in the psychology
department. The undergraduates, then as now, continually complained
about "rats" and demanded more "relevant" courses. The basic researchers
were annoyed when pressured to offer applied courses. The department,
with an aversion to anything applied, particularly anything clinical,
continued to appoint only "basic" scientists, and it had successfully
resisted the hue and cry from the unenlightened mob. I, of course,
agreed with the mob, and the student pressure continued to build. The
department thought I might "look" like a clinical psychologist and that
it could fob the applied courses off on

me, all the while hoping that my rock-bottom loyalty lay with basic
laboratory research. This, I suspect, was much debated, and if asked,
even I could not have answered definitively. But I was not asked. The
vote was taken, and I was offered an associate professorship of
psychology with tenure. By accident, I walked by the room during the
debate and heard only two words. A basso profundo voice that I
recognized as that of the chair of the clinical wing boomed out, "On
balance..."

Chapter Ten

Tenured (1972)

I GOT MY IDEAL job, and it was for life. I was becoming well-known in
experimental psychology, but its lack of application to real human
affairs gnawed at me. I'd been hired by the most "basic" (some would say
"constipated") psychology department in America partly as a sop to
student demands for "relevance," and some of my colleagues already saw
me as a wolf in sheep's clothing. They were looking over my shoulder,
and they were right to be leery. Experimental psychology and clinical
psychology were just tools---mere methods---for approaching bigger
questions. There were other tools to be tried, and I wanted to spread my
wings to explore the bigger questions. As I had been five years before,
when I started at Cornell, I was fast and in a hurry. When I read an
article, no matter how important, I sprinted to the finish and got onto
the next item of work. I missed fine points. I cut off conversations
once I got the gist, which usually happened sooner rather than later,
and just as they had at Cornell, people saw me as brusque or even rude
and self-obsessed. I did not step back and savor what I'd accomplished.
I was out of touch with the people who loved me and with the friends who
liked me. I worked eighty hours a week, and when not overtly working, I
was always thinking about psychology and philosophy. I paid too little
attention to my wife and daughter, to my mother and father. My only
friendships were with my students and colleagues. I was pretty negative.
Considerable and unexpected success bolstered my outward confidence and
optimism, but underneath I was still anxious a lot. I brooded. When
thwarted, I got depressed, but unlike my dogs, I never gave up. I
readily saw what was wrong in psychology, but sometimes I also saw what
was correct, once in a while down to its very

core. "NEAL IS REALLY pissed at you, Marty," said Jay Weiss. It was a
gorgeous late-April day in Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia, the white
apple blossoms exploding. The occasion was the annual meeting of the
Eastern Psychological Association, and Jay had presented his doctoral
research, conducted with Neal Miller at Yale using the triadic design in
rats and looking at stomach ulcers. Jay found that the rats with
inescapable shock got the most stomach ulcers.1 This debunked a famous
study in monkeys by Joseph V. Brady purportedly showing that the
"executives," the monkeys who could turn off the shock, got the ulcers.2
But Brady made the mistake of not assigning his monkeys randomly to
escapable or inescapable shock; rather he made the monkeys who started
to respond earliest the executives. So the monkeys most upset by the
shock became the executives and got the ulcers. Brady inferred that
helplessness was good for you, and control was bad. Jay got it right and
randomly assigned his rats in the triadic design, and his results were
clear and opposite to Brady's. It's good to be the executive and bad to
be the slave. Jay's was a lovely piece of science. "What's eating Neal?"
I asked, puzzled. The last thing I wanted to do was alienate the most
powerful experimental psychologist in the world. "Your articles about
controllable and uncontrollable shock and predictable and unpredictable
shock don't cite him as having priority. Neal worked on this as Arlo
Myers's supervisor in 1956, even though they never published," said Jay.
I had gotten pretty full of myself on the importance of learned
helplessness, and this conversation was deflating. But it was also
thought provoking. Naturally I thought that Steve and I "owned" learned
helplessness (or at least Dick Solomon or Russ Leaf or Bruce Overmier
did) and the triadic design as well. I had never heard of Arlo Myers,
and when I later looked up his dissertation, it did not seem
particularly on point. But who "owns" what? Who should get the "credit"?
Who has "priority"? That someone as illustrious and established as Neal
Miller worried about such stuff told me this issue was serious and deep.
Priority had engendered much bitterness and lasting enmity in science,
and almost everyone tended to overclaim for themselves and undercite
everyone else. I knew how annoyed and resentful I felt when someone

failed to cite me. Dick Solomon provided the answer. He was
intellectually generous. He was a fountain of ideas---some good, more
half-baked---and he spewed them forth every Thursday in his luncheon
seminar. He encouraged us to do the same. I resolved to be like Dick and
not like Neal. I had lots of ideas and was not afraid to give voice to
them, even if they turned out to be wrong or even foolish. I erred on
the side of not being boring rather than that of being right. Ownership
in my view belonged to the person who ran with the idea, not to the
person who thought it up. For the rest of my life, I spewed forth ideas,
not vetting them as thoroughly as others did, and I encouraged my
students and colleagues to run with them. When they later asked me to be
first author of a resulting article or fifth author because I had
thought the original idea up, I usually declined. I made the mistake of
under-citing---but usually from lack of scholarship, not from lack of
generosity in giving credit. I also made the mistake of
over-claiming---but usually for the sake of pushing the limits of an
idea, not for the sake of pushing myself or for publicity. I didn't have
answers for the general problem of ownership of ideas, but with the
hindsight of fifty years, I want to put ownership in perspective for the
case of learned helplessness. Learned helplessness illuminated a
dimension consigned to silence by behaviorism and therefore
unresearchable: the dimension of personal control. Control is both a
cognition and a cognition about the future, both forbidden by
behaviorism. To have a contingency between a voluntary response and an
outcome is to control that outcome. The dog in the escape group controls
the shock, and the dog expects to have control in the future. Is the dog
motivated to want control for its own sake? Do we want more than just
lots of good stuff and little bad stuff? Do we also want control over
the good stuff and the bad stuff? Is control a basic motivation?
"Control" meant something different in the 1960s than it means fifty
years later. Then it was used not in the sense of personal control but
almost entirely in sense of governmental or organizational control. When
our work was translated into German (and French, Portuguese, and
Spanish), we were told something was "off" about our use of the term. In
German, individual people don't controllieren; only the

government does. But something was blowing in the wind, and learned
helplessness was one of the squalls. It was the idea that individual
people, you and I, can and should control what is important to us.
Control certainly mattered in and of itself for the white-footed deer
mouse in a 1967 experiment. This creature, when captured, was in a
continuous wrestling match with the humans who thought they ran the lab.
The humans set the lights to bright, and the mouse could press a bar to
alter the level of lighting. The mouse stepped down the illumination to
live in dim lighting. Maybe the mouse just liked dimness. So the next
day the humans stepped the lights down to the chosen dimness, but the
mouse again fought them and set its ambient lighting up to bright. The
mouse seemed to care not about any particular level of light but about
having control over its light.3 Not just mice. Old people as well. When
I was a graduate student, an ever-smiling undergraduate worked alongside
us in Dick Solomon's lab and was great fun to be around. Aside from
bustling around the lab and enchanting all of us, she was also president
of student government in the College for Women. Her name was Judith
Seitz, soon to be Judy Rodin. Judy went on to a PhD at Columbia under
one of the most illustrious social psychologists of the twentieth
century, Stanley Schachter. Just at the time I settled back in at Penn,
Judy, by then an assistant professor at Yale, teamed up with Ellen
Langer. Ellen was a pistol, and experimenting in the real world with
real people came as second nature to her, as it did for Stan Schachter.
She and Judy decided to look at the effect of control in a setting that
often deprived human beings of it: a nursing home.4

Judith Rodin was an undergrad at Penn when I was a graduate student. She
went on to become a pioneering researcher in personal control, then the
provost at Yale, then president at Penn, and ultimately the president of
the Rockefeller Foundation. Photo courtesy of the Rockefeller
Foundation.

On the fourth floor of the nursing home, Ellen and Judy gave fortyseven
patients a lecture. The lecture stressed responsibility: you decide how
to arrange your room, and you decide how to spend your time. Each
patient also picked out a houseplant that was theirs to keep and tend.
On the second floor, forty-seven other patients got a lecture stressing
all the good things that were done for them. The staff arranged their
rooms for them and scheduled how they spent their time. Each patient was
given a houseplant and told that the nurse would take care of it. Ellen
and Judy decided to measure activity. The 1970s were low-tech rubber
band and paper clip days, so they cleverly put white adhesive tape on
the wheels of the wheelchairs and just measured how dirty the tape got.
The patients on the "control" floor were more active and healthier, and
eighteen months later only seven (15 percent) had died. Thirteen (30
percent) of the patients from the second floor had died. Ellen and Judy
argued that having control was a basic source of vitality and that being
deprived of it might be lethal for an otherwise weakened person. For
now, keep in mind that there were only two groups in the Langer and
Rodin experiment, so it was unclear if having control enhanced vitality
and/or not having control diminished it. (An ideal experiment would have
included a third group that received no lecture at all.) It took another
thirty years before Steve Maier figured out which was likely true. It
was an indication of the growing respectability of control as a
legitimate object of study that Ellen went on to become the first
tenured woman in the psychology department at Harvard and Judy became
provost at Yale, then president of Penn, and finally head of the
powerful Rockefeller Foundation. Other influential theorists started to
talk about control beginning in the late 1950s. I omit the great
historical forerunners: Pico della Mirandola, Erasmus, Francis Bacon,
Arminius, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Alfred Adler, to name just six. (I
hope someday to do them justice.) The first modern was Robert White, who
published on "competence" in 1959: people and animals, he asserted, play
and explore for their own sake.5 This paper was widely read; indeed, it
was assigned to me as an undergraduate and stuck in my memory when I
went to work on learned helplessness. Julian Rotter, a social
psychologist, developed the concept of "locus of control," with some
people being "externals," believing that the environment or other people
shape their lives, and others being

"internals," believing that they themselves shape their own lives.6 This
attracted a large following in social psychology, but I did not read
about it until after we published the first learned helplessness
experiments. Stanford professor Albert Bandura, today the most-cited
living psychologist, touted the concept of "self-efficacy." An "efficacy
expectation" is the belief that you, yourself, can bring about the
outcomes you desire, whereas an "outcome expectation" is the belief that
the outcome you desire will simply happen. He castigated us for not
making this distinction. Self-efficacy equals control.7 Richard Lazarus
at Berkeley proposed a cognitive "appraisal" theory. When an event
occurs, the organism first assesses the consequences of the event
(primary appraisal), then asks if it has the ability to cope with the
event and its consequences. This is "secondary appraisal."8 Coping was
Lazarus-speak for control. So learned helplessness, finding the downside
of not having control, was really just one step in a vigorous march
emphasizing the benefits of the presence of control. While we
self-centeredly thought of our own work as huge, Steve and I were in
fact just part of two intertwined developments making their way into
mainstream psychology: the new acceptance of cognition and the new
dimension of control. Our particular niche was the absence of control,
helplessness. By the turn of the millennium, both control and cognition
were firmly entrenched in mainstream psychology. BY 1972, the learned
helplessness was catching on. Other scientists had

replicated it in rats and mice, and it would soon be found in goldfish
and cats and even cockroaches.9 This was a relief to me, since I hoped
that we had found a general process, but at first I worried that we had
tapped into some quirky human-dog submission pattern, and that learned
helplessness was just a species-specific artifact. (Behold the external
validity problem once again.) A similar worry was that the expectation
Nothing I do matters was not general but somehow set off by trauma. Did
learned helplessness occur across good and neutral events as well as bad
ones? To find out, researchers gave food to rats independently of their
actions, and these rats later had trouble learning to press a bar for
food. They became passive. The same seemed to hold when lights and
sounds were first presented independently of action.10 Yes, there was an
"entitlement" effect, and "spoiled" rats learned to

be lazy about good events and didn't even try to control them. But for
all that progress, I had real doubts about the external validity of the
learned helplessness endeavor. Was it just a laboratory curiosity that
like so many others would gather dust on library shelves? Was it a model
of real depression in the clinic? Did it capture the essence of what a
human being experiences when her spouse dies, or bankruptcy occurs, or
she is rejected by her boyfriend? The next logical step on the path to
external validity was for some brave soul to do laboratory learned
helplessness experiments in people. The answer to my prayers came in the
form of Donald Hiroto. As a graduate student at Oregon State University,
Hiroto built a human shuttle box, a two-chambered device about four feet
long. The human subject, wearing earphones, heard a very loud tone while
he rested one hand in the shuttle box. If he moved his hand to the other
side of the shuttle box, the tone stopped, and people easily learned to
escape the tone. Against this background, on the previous day in another
room, Hiroto recreated the triadic design: all wearing earphones, one
group got the tone but could escape it by pushing a button. The second
group was yoked and got an inescapable tone, and the third group got no
tone. The next day in the shuttle box the results exactly paralleled
those in rats and dogs. Twothirds of the individuals who got the
inescapable tone just left their hands in the shuttle box passively and
did not even try to escape. An exceedingly formal Japanese American, Don
arrived at Penn as my very first postdoctoral student. He was
obsessively thorough, exactly the right kind of researcher needed to
build the systematic case for external validity. He insisted on calling
me "Professor Seligman," even though he was older and much better
dressed than I. "Professor Seligman," Don said, "let's do exactly what
other people are doing in rats and find out if helplessness in people is
general. If you are helpless about escaping noise, do you become
helpless about solving cognitive problems and back again." He then did
exactly that, looking at the interchangeability of helplessness across
two instrumental and two cognitive tasks. Three groups of people got
anagrams: solvable (e.g., OTAIP), unsolvable (e.g., OTEIP), or nothing,
and the next day they went to the shuttle box. The solvable group and
the zero group escaped the loud noise well. Two-thirds of the people in
the unsolvable group, however, just sat there passively and didn't even
try to escape the noise. Similarly, helplessness regarding the loud tone
debilitated people in

solving later cognitive problems.11 I was proud of this work and gushed
about it to Tim Beck during one of our monthly lunches at Kelly and
Cohen's. (There was no Kelly, but it was still the most popular deli in
West Philadelphia.) Tim was usually the gentlest and most nondirective
of critics, so I choked on my grilled Reuben when he said, "Marty, if
you continue down this path, you will waste your life." I was stirred
but not yet shaken. Tim was telling me to take up new methods and to do
a better job with external validity by turning my work to deal directly
with real people and real problems. But it took a numinous dream a few
nights later to shake my foundations: I somehow found myself in the New
York Guggenheim Museum. I was slowly plodding up its famous curving
ramp. There were rooms off to the right every few paces, and in the
rooms people were playing with cards. They seemed to be tarot cards. I
asked, "Why is everyone playing with cards?" Whereupon the roof of the
museum opened, and God appeared---only his head and not his body. In
case you are wondering, God is very old, he is male, he has a white,
well-tended, curly beard, and he has a booming bass voice. He said,
unforgettably, "Seligman, at least you are starting to ask the right
questions."

Chapter Eleven

Tessitura (1973--1974)

"TESSITURA"1 IS A term for a singer's most comfortable vocal range---
the range in which she will make her most beautiful music. A
mezzosoprano can hit a high C, but she has to strain to stay there, and
you can hear it. Tessitura is the place where you find your true voice,
where you can have a long and healthy career. The quest for my tessitura
in psychology was a search in three dimensions: style, tempo, and
content. "EVERY TIME I construct a sentence," said Dick Solomon to Steve
and me, "I first talk to the person perched on my right shoulder." The
occasion was dinner at my favorite restaurant, Le Bec Fin. Georges
Perrier had created this temple of classic French cuisine in the late
1960s, and I became one of his poorest but steadiest customers. I became
comfortable there. I saved up, and whenever there was anything to
celebrate, I visited. On this evening the dish was the lightest quenelle
de brochet imaginable in a coral-hued lobster sauce, and the wine was a
pale yellow Puligny Montrachet. Dick, Steve, and I were celebrating the
acceptance of a paper by a good journal. "On my right shoulder sits
Harold Schlosberg, my mentor at Brown," continued Dick. "I read the
sentence to Harold very slowly, and if he nods his head, I turn to my
left shoulder. On my left shoulder sits my other mentor, Walter S.
Hunter. I now read him the sentence very slowly, and if he also nods,
the sentence goes in. If not, I start again." Dick transported his
graduate mentors at Brown in his imagination when he went off to teach
at Harvard, and he then brought them to Penn. I didn't have to imagine
my mentors, because they were here with me in Philadelphia. Two of them,
Dick and Frank Irwin, would serve my

journal style well by perching on my shoulders since each edited a major
journal. I didn't need to imagine their comments, since I routinely sent
each of them an early draft of any paper I was writing. Dick and Frank
were very careful in print, and so they were the ideal editors of the
Psychological Review and the Journal of Experimental Psychology,
respectively. In their writing they crafted long sentences, and any one
lifted out of context was self-contained and likely true. Here's a
typical one from Dick: Because we shall show that discriminative
instrumental acts can be established without those acts having been
reinforced differentially (because they could not occur under curare),
then a revision of theories emphasizing the importance of peripheral,
skeletal responding and proprioceptive cues seems definitely to be
required.2 And a typical one from Frank: The present experiment was
designed to determine whether, as predicted on these grounds, the number
of cards required for decisions in the expanded judgment situation would
increase with the value of money prizes for correct decisions and would
decrease with increased money cost per card.3 How many times did you
have to read each sentence to understand it? Twice for me, and I know
these topics well. Their style was "reviewer friendly," and indeed Dick
and Frank rarely encountered a journal rejection, but their style was
not "reader friendly." I tried not to write like they did. Most readers
are busy. I sure am. Many readers just scan. I know I do. Help the
scanners by using short sentences and plain words. The big word and the
long sentence must increase accuracy a lot to make up for impeded
reading. And don't overwrite. Omit extra words and information that the
reader already knows. Overwriting slows the reader way down and does not
increase accuracy much at all. In style, even if it defied the American
Psychological Association's best-selling publication manual,4 I had
found my tessitura. MY TEMPO WAS wrong. My father, Adrian, was fast, and
Irene said that he

could do in one hour what other lawyers took eight to do. But Irene also
said that he then could use the extra seven hours to check and perfect.
I had Adrian's speed, but I just raced on to the next task rather than
checking and perfecting. My speeding was not limited to work, and I

suspect that my poor tempo in part led to others' finding me brusque and
inferring that I was self-absorbed. Are there any slow psychologists?
There was at least one, William K. Estes, the premier mathematical
learning theorist. Conversing with Bill was agony. "Bill," I asked at a
party where he was the guest of honor, "what do you think the
evolutionary function of sleeping is?" He stared at me unblinking. I
waited. I waited. It was so long I started to count to myself. At
forty-five, he blinked and his lips finally moved. "What, Marty, do you
think is the evolutionary function of being awake?" Could I learn to be
slow, not as slow as Bill Estes, but slow enough not to offend? THE
DEPARTMENT WAS hiring someone who worked in vision, the most

scientifically sophisticated branch of psychology. Ed Pugh, the
candidate, gave his job talk on how many photons of light it took to
fire a single retinal cell. Between one and seven seemed to be the
answer. This was all way over my head, but at the reception afterward, I
managed to ask Ed a question that was not completely idiotic. Ed waited
a full ten seconds and then gave me a full answer delivered at the slow
pace I needed to understand him. He also made me feel that I'd asked him
a first-rate question that took him to the cutting edge of visual
science. "You're really slow, Ed," I commented and immediately explained
that I meant it as a compliment. "Have you always been so slow?" "I was
an all-state quarterback in my Louisiana high school. There are no slow
quarterbacks," Ed replied. "I had to learn slow. After college I tried
to become a Jesuit. Jesuit students have two mentors. One grades you,
and the other is your 'socius.' Day after day my socius would write just
one sentence and then instruct me to go sit under the tree in the
cloister for the rest of the afternoon and think about that sentence."
"Can you teach me to be slow, Ed?" I asked. After we hired Ed, he took
me under his wing and taught me how to be slow. For a year we met once a
week in my office to read Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling. We did only
one page each week. I became slower. Maybe too slow. Alan Kors was a new
assistant professor of history, fresh from his Harvard doctorate on
Baron d'Holbach and the French Encyclopedists.

Alan and I had been good friends for a decade. He was a classmate at
Princeton, editor of our literary magazine, and the most entertaining of
the undergraduate literati at Wilson Lodge. That he was an incomparable
storyteller and improvised endless rhyming doggerel on his guitar at
parties did not mask that he was also a serious poet. He was an
outspoken atheist and, as best man at my wedding with Kerry, stood
shoulder to shoulder with me against my mother-in-law-to-be, who cursed
and wailed when I refused to allow the G word at the ceremony. It was a
tremendous personal boon to me that he joined Penn's history department.
"Let's teach together, Marty," suggested Alan. We shared many mutual
interests: brainwashing, religious conversion, poetry, and the history
of science. I agreed instantly. Alan was also as mesmerizing a teacher
as he was a conversationalist, the only Penn professor I knew of to ever
get perfect teaching ratings in a huge lecture course---a 5.0 from every
single student. I tried out my new slow, noninterrupting style with
Alan. I sat in the back row of the class we were to teach together. Alan
began his lecture. About one hundred undergraduates were present, and
the topic was science during the Enlightenment. At several points, he
brought up issues that I knew a bit about, and I was tempted to
interrupt. But, no, I waited for Alan to introduce me. The lecture went
on... and on. It was fascinating and entertaining, pure Alan Kors. But
he did not introduce me. After ninety minutes, the lecture was over, and
I had been silent. Alan and I walked back to the student center for
coffee. "What happened?" I asked, miffed. "You were supposed to
introduce me." "What happened?" Alan replied, also miffed. "You were
supposed to interrupt---like you usually do." My tempo was far from
perfect, but it was slowing down. CONTENT WAS THE final element of my
tessitura. Behaviorism at its heart

was trying to banish two things from science: mental life, of course,
and the future---teleology, forward-looking explanations of action.
These issues played out in my own department, often in tense
conversations. One occurred in 1972 in the "chance encounter" room, the
windowless, grotty basement of one of the three buildings among which
the burstingat-the-seams psychology department was scattered miserably.
In the

hope that some psychologists would bump into each other occasionally, a
handful of us made a practice of lounging there, drinking instant
coffee. Dave Williams popped in often, and we continued our endless
argument over whether people and animals have a rich mental life, with
Dave saying they don't and me saying they do, but I could sense that
Dave was giving in and abandoning the barren world of Skinnerian
psychology. He was on a new but flailing search to be someplace lusher
and greener. Even though smoking was forbidden, Frank Irwin spent a lot
of time in the chance encounter room. This was his last year of
teaching, and he remained the most upright pillar in the most rigid of
psychology departments. All the hours he spent there were emblematic of
what an upright departmental citizen he was. I told Frank that Jim
Johnston and I were slaving away on a comprehensive
cognitive---"Irwinian"---theory of avoidance learning. Our theory was a
stark contrast---some might say a "slap in the face"---to the pursuit to
which Neal Miller and Dick Solomon had both devoted their past two
decades. If correct, our theory would not make me any more popular with
my fellow learning theorists, who already saw me as suspect because of
the cognitive slant of learned helplessness. Learning how to avoid
something unpleasant had become the testing ground of the entire
behaviorist program. Neal and Dick wanted to show that avoidance could
be completely explained without any reference to either the future or
cognition. The future cannot act on the present, they reasoned, so any
teleological explanation has causality working backward in time, which
is a philosophical error of the first water. In avoidance learning,
animals were first given escape training in which a tone preceded a
shock by five seconds. The animals could escape the shock by jumping
over a barrier to the safe side. Jumping over the barrier also turned
off the signaling tone. Animals quickly learned to jump as soon as the
tone went on, but before the shock. This was called avoidance learning
because the animals avoided more shock by jumping as soon as they heard
the tone---which both prevented the shock and terminated the tone.
Avoidance, to the uninitiated, looked like a prime case of a
future-directed cognition, the lay explanation being If I jump, I will
avoid future shock. So it became a crucial task of the behaviorists to
show that they could completely explain the jumping without reference to
the future. This was quite a trick, and an explanation of avoidance
referencing only the present and the past was considered a tour de force

for learning theory.5 Here's how the explanation---two-process
theory---worked. It denied that the animals expected anything at all,
claiming that a nonoccurring event---the avoided shock---could have no
role in conditioning. Instead, a present event, the tone coming on,
became fear-evoking by the usual process of Pavlovian conditioning,
having previously been paired with shock. So jumping, by getting the
fearful tone to stop, was actually instrumentally reinforced and not at
all motivated by avoidance of a shock that never came on. By contrast,
Jim and I claimed that the animals learned first that the tone predicted
shock and then that jumping during the tone, but before the shock went
on, was followed by no shock. Thus they learned the expectation If I
jump during the tone, I will get no shock.6 That expectation---an
if-then conditional about a future outcome that does not
happen---explained avoidance. This was a rare instance of a head-on
collision between two theories where a crucial prediction could settle
the argument, in this case, about what happens during extinction. Once
the animals became steady jumpers, they never got shocked again, and so
the tone was no longer paired with shock. This "Pavlovian extinction"
should have caused the tone to lose its fearful properties. If the
animals were jumping merely to turn off the fearful tone, as two-process
theory contended, they should stop after enough trials to extinguish
fear of the tone. If, on the other hand, they were jumping to prevent
the anticipated shock, as Jim and I contended, the jumping should
continue, as every jump would bear out their if-then expectation that
jumping would prevent shock---extinction breaks the association of tone
and shock, but it does not disconfirm the conditional If I jump, I will
not be shocked. In fact, every "extinction" trial continued to confirm
the conditional expectation. So if this expectation underpinned the
jumping, jumping would persist. Which is exactly what happened. Hundreds
of trials later, the animals were still jumping. They also looked
nonchalant, not like animals escaping fear.7 Jim was obsessive, and it
took us more than a year of arguing, sentence by sentence, with each
other to work out every detail. We went through all the evidence
exhaustively; it was entirely consistent with a cognitive theory of
avoidance and inconsistent at the crucial points with the dominant
two-process theory. Once we were sure, I sent Frank Irwin

a draft to follow up our chance encounter room chats and presented a
colloquium to the department. Frank had had a very long dry spell, and
this was the first and only major use ever made of his theory. He sent
me a handwritten letter saying how happy he was to have lived to see his
way of looking at learning come to fruition. I was pleased this time to
receive such a fulsome thank-you, rather than his usual lake of red ink.
This paper was a major "teaching moment" for me. I was sure we'd nailed
it and that two-factor theorists would acknowledge that we were right.
But I was under a misapprehension about confrontation in science. I
thought that science should proceed by looking for crucial differences
between theories and then testing the opposing predictions. This is what
Carl Sagan called "good" science: the moon either is or is not covered
with a thick layer of dust, and when humans landed on the moon, the dust
theory of the origin of the solar system was proved wrong and abandoned.
By 1973, I had been in the ring for three heavyweight boxing matches
with the dominant stimulus-response-reinforcement theorists. The first
was over learned helplessness. In response to our contention that
learned helplessness entailed the cognition Nothing I do matters,
learning theorists had posited that a few random shock-offsets had just
superstitiously reinforced a motor response of standing still. Steve
Maier killed that one by explicitly reinforcing standing still in a
group of dogs and showing that they were not helpless. I suppose I
expected the Skinnerians to stand up and concede that they were wrong
and we were right, but they did not. Rather, learning theorists made
almost no response and thereafter just went silent about learned
helplessness. They simply excluded it from the learning theory corpus
thereafter. Then there was John Garcia and sauce béarnaise. I suppose I
expected the Pavlovians, who held the premise that any conditional
stimulus paired with any unconditional stimulus would result in
conditioning, to hang it up and admit they were wrong. But again they
were almost silent ---uncomfortably so about Garcia, although they
grudgingly elected him to the National Academy of Science. Finally,
there was the cognitive theory of avoidance. I was surprised by the
reaction from our learning theory colleagues---there was none. Dick
Solomon, perfect gentleman that he was, never said a word to me about
this paper. Neal Miller, Bob Rescorla, and the rest of the learning
theory gang stayed silent and stayed silent and stayed silent.

Instead of an abject surrender, there was no surrender at all, just a
gradual drift. I should have known. Behaviorist learning theory
eventually relinquished its ambition to explain "all behavior."8 It
abandoned wholesale anti-mentalism and subtly allowed in "expectations"
to explain conditioned behavior. The picture of conditioning itself
underwent gradual revision, resulting in the view that "the organism is
better seen as an information seeker using logical and perceptual
relations among stimuli, along with its own preconceptions, to form a
sophisticated representation of the world." Thus the great program of
learning theory, the attempt to explain behavior without positing the
"forbidden" mental representation of possible futures, slowly folded.
Even more importantly, the possibility of a science that takes seriously
thinking about the future opened. But why were thoughts about the future
"forbidden" in the first place? A huge conceptual error animated
behaviorism, in which something genuinely suspect---causation backward
in time, the future determining the present---was conflated with
something not at all mysterious, namely, guidance by here-and-now
cognitions that bear information about possible futures. There is
nothing mysterious, or causally backward, about present action being
guided by present thoughts of what will happen in the future. I also
suppose it should have come as no surprise that my Skinnerian and
Pavlovian colleagues were not grateful to me for my part in showing them
the error of their ways. Rather, to be candid, I left a bad taste in
their mouths. And my takeaway? I too had a bad taste in my mouth, but
I'd come to know my tessitura, my thinking's comfort zone: I looked for
the most basic premise of the prevailing theory and asked what would
follow if it were entirely wrong? I was learning not to expect
popularity, but in my heart I knew that truth would out. "WHAT IS A
'trade' book?" I asked. I'd never heard of such a beast. "It is smack in
between a scholarly monograph, like you usually write, and a mass market
book that you find in airports," answered Buck (Hayward) Rogers. Buck,
representing W. H. Freeman publishers, took me to dinner at Le Bec Fin.
"You've been writing about helplessness. This is not a dry topic only
for professionals. It's of great interest to the educated public.
Helplessness, you yourself have written, bears on

depression, on death, and on raising kids. There has been only one such
a 'trade' book in psychology, the Social Animal. Yours would be the
second." I took the offer seriously. Such a project would require me to
organize my thoughts on external validity---whether helplessness really
matters--- as well as give me an opportunity to justify and explain
experimental psychology to the public. It seemed like the first step on
a path to the unknown. Jim Johnston, with his usual skepticism, asked me
if the world needed a whole book about helplessness. BY 1974 I had found
my tessitura.

In style, I was comfortable writing plainly: few big words, short
sentences, brief paragraphs, and straightforward arguments. In tempo, I
was becoming slower. I was more deliberate in speech as well as thought.
My pace had improved. Though imperfect it was closer to right than it
had ever been. Content is what really matters. Physics and chemistry had
engineering before they became "basic" sciences. Physics predicted
eclipses and tides and the trajectories of cannonballs. Alchemy invented
medicines and paints, even if it could not make gold out of lead. Basic
physicists and chemists therefore knew what merited further drilling
down. Psychology, in contrast, had never had engineering---it had no
discoveries and inventions that worked in the real world---so what was
"basic" to psychology was arbitrary. This was what bothered me so about
learning theory, because it was far from evident that Pavlovian
conditioning and instrumental training were basic to anything. My
tessitura followed. I would choose psychological topics anchored in the
real world, document them at the real-world level, and then drill down
to find their elements. The world did indeed need a book about
helplessness.

Chapter Twelve

England (1975)

KERRY, I, AND our two children, Amanda, five, and David, twenty months,
boarded the British Airways flight to London on a freezing January night
in 1975. We rented a three-bedroom detached house on Westover Road in a
slightly gentrified district of Wandsworth, just one bridge south of the
Thames from Chelsea. We bought a used Volvo station wagon for me to make
the thirty-minute drive through the grotty areas of Battersea, Clapham,
and then Brixton to work in Denmark Hill. I had a Guggenheim Fellowship
and was to be a visiting professor at the Institute of Psychiatry of the
Maudsley and Bethlem Hospitals. My principal reason for going to England
was to learn more clinical psychology at the premier settings in the
world. Both these institutions have glorious histories: aside from the
fact that the word "bedlam" derives from the behavior of the insane
inmates at the Bethlem Royal Hospital, the Maudsley was home to a
distinguished line of psychiatrists, and the Institute of Psychiatry was
its crown jewel, the central research and training hub for young
clinical psychologists in England. Hans Eysenck presided over this
sprawling center. Hans was one of the great psychologists of the second
half of the twentieth century, and his life was a portrait of moral and
intellectual courage. He was born in Germany in 1916. As a schoolboy,
being taught in class that the Jews had sold out Germany in the Great
War, Hans (who was not Jewish) wrote an essay on the courage of those
Kaiser Wilhelm Medal winners who were Jewish. Shortly thereafter, he
pointedly turned his back on a Nazi speaker in class, and his teacher
secretly told him to get out of Germany as quickly as possible. Leaving
his parents, he slipped away on a train, making his way eventually to
England, but as a suspect German émigré, he then could not get a job
there. He earned his PhD at the

University of London with Sir Cyril Burt, a leading researcher on the
heritability of IQ. Before long Hans was embroiled in a related
controversy. He developed a theory of personality involving neuroticism
and introversion and wanted to know the origin of these personality
types. But this was the heyday of radical environmentalism---the belief
that we are no more than what experience happens to write upon our blank
slate. Personality had somehow to arise from our surroundings. This was
one of the only dogmas that American ideals (all men are created equal)
and Soviet ideals (the creation of the "Soviet Man") agreed about. In
the wake of the eugenic program of the Nazis and their defeat, work on
genetic influences in human development was anathema. Hardly a Nazi
sympathizer, Hans sponsored twin studies of a host of personality
traits, including IQ. The data kept showing that personality is highly
heritable and IQ even more so: identical twins are much more similar for
almost every personality trait than are fraternal twins. Further,
adopted kids are much less similar to their parents than are biological
offspring. As a reward for this research, the left-wing press called
Hans a fascist. He was regularly heckled at his public speeches and even
assaulted at one. Undeterred, he told me that his primary loyalty lay
with the "arguments that needed hearers" and that "truth will out." I
would prefer, on moral grounds, for radical environmentalism to be true,
but it is false. The Garcia effect and my own work on prepared learning
demonstrate this dogma to be completely untenable. And too much human
experience conflicts with it. Could it be that we inherit from our
parents not just their eye color and height or even their IQ but their
personalities, their hopes, their very fantasies, and the form of their
dreams? I suspect that the endeavors--- nurturing, fighting,
politicking, persuading, commanding, seducing, or stealing---that our
parents and their parents were good at, we too will be good at---and for
genetic reasons. Consider divorce: it is highly heritable. A divorcé's
identical twin is far more likely to be divorced than his fraternal
twin. The inheritance of global personality characteristics--- meanness,
agreeableness, lust, loyalty, promiscuity---must account for this. There
is no divorce gene. Evolution selects only secondarily for genes; it
selects primarily for the actual large-scale characteristics that
enhance reproductive success and survival: modules such as beauty,
aggressiveness, smarts, speed, and strength. The modules simply drag
along the genes of which they happen to be constructed. Carl Jung, on

this view, was not far wrong with his "archetypes," and Hans headed a
research program that led us more toward the true nature of the human
beast than the dogma of radical environmentalism. "There might be more
to where personality comes from than just genes and the environment," he
said when we met for the first time. Hans was tall, stiffly erect of
posture, with wavy brown hair and arresting blue eyes. He looked closer
to forty-five than sixty. He chose his words very carefully, but they
exuded a quiet honesty, and he brimmed with enthusiasm. His soft
charisma carried me away. "How about the stars? There's an unpopular
view." "Astrology?" I asked incredulously. Talk about wading into
another controversy. "Neo-astrology. Take this home and pore through
it," Hans said, passing me a two-inch-thick data printout. "Michel and
Françoise Gauquelin condemn traditional astrology as unscientific, and
they have done what looks to me like rigorous research. This printout
purports to show that we can predict the occupations of famous Frenchmen
from the positions of specific planets at the exact moment of their
births. Sportsmen and military men (warlike) tend to have Mars at
mid-heaven when they are born. Actors (the Jovian personality) tend to
have Jupiter at mid-heaven, and scientists and doctors (saturnine
introverts) have Saturn at mid-heaven.1 And it's not just Frenchmen;
this has been replicated for Belgians." I took the pile home to
Wandsworth and ran statistics on it. They confirmed what Hans said. I
couldn't find anything amiss and told Hans as much at dinner in a chichi
Clapham restaurant a few weeks later. "But there is no conceivable
mechanism," I said. "The hands of the midwife exert far more influence
on the baby than the infinitesimal force of a distant planet. Influence
falls off with the square of the distance." "Mechanism? We don't even
have a mechanism for gravity," retorted Hans. As I leaned in to object,
my head came too close to a candle, and my hair caught fire. Sybil and
Kerry doused the flames with their glasses of water. I was embarrassed
and singed but uninjured. I never published on neo-astrology, and
neither, I believe, did Hans. We were both singed, however, by our
common belief that the universe holds many more secrets than our poor
little science can detect.

HANS FLOATED ABOVE the Maudsley. He played a role I had not seen

before, but it gave a shape to my future. My parents wanted an Einstein,
a genius who could penetrate to the depths of scientific problems. I was
no Einstein. I was no Wittgenstein. It was not just that I was not smart
enough or deep enough. It was also a matter of tessitura. My comfort
zone did not include taking a single problem and riding it all the way
to the bottom. Rather, I was coming to realize, I had a "start-up"
mentality and a broad "entrepreneurial" bent. This is pretty far from
the standard mentality of an academic. I could see and then pounce on a
basic issue that needed reframing, usually one at the heart of a popular
enterprise that I found wrongheaded. Learned helplessness took on the
dominant enterprise of stimulus-response-reinforcement learning theory,
and we did the start-up work to move animal psychology in a cognitive
direction. Prepared learning took on the dominant enterprise of
environmentalism, and we tried to move it in a direction that takes
evolution more seriously. I enjoyed laying the bricks for the new ground
floor myself, but then I wanted to get my students and colleagues to
complete the edifice. This is the role of not an Einstein but an
Oppenheimer. J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904--1967) was a highly competent
physicist with sufficient grasp of all the relevant kinds of physics
needed to build an atomic bomb, the vision to see the big picture, and
the ability to coordinate all the moving parts of the physics in the
Manhattan Project. He never got the Nobel Prize. My parents did not get
an Einstein. At best, maybe they got an Oppenheimer. But I did not yet
know what my Manhattan Project was to be. Hans was an Oppenheimer and
the only one operating in psychology. He was the overseer of an
institute that did research ranging over psychotherapy, personality,
genetics, anxiety, depression, sexuality, intelligence, and more, and
everyone at the institute approached these topics with a distinctive
Eysenckian bent. A LONG, DEAFENING scream froze us in our tracks. S. J.
(Jack) Rachman

and I were walking down the corridor to Isaac Marks's office. The scream
was issuing from behind his closed door. Isaac was my official host.
Dean Schuyler, my therapy mentor at Penn, told me about the wonderful
month he had spent with Isaac the year before, and Isaac then invited me
to spend my sabbatical under his

auspices at the institute. Isaac, an émigré from South Africa, had
received his MD in Cape Town, trained as a psychiatrist in London, and,
with the 1969 publication of Fears and Phobias,2 catapulted to the top
rank of research psychiatrists in the field of anxiety. He was slight of
build, warm and welcoming of manner, and an aesthete. A walk through a
flower garden with Isaac brought a running commentary on subtle
variations in the scents of the roses and even the scent of the irises
we passed. He and Shula, a historian of South African politics, hosted
soirees in their fashionable Dulwich Common cottage, the most recent
evening spent on T. S. Eliot's "Four Quartets." Isaac liked the
preparedness slant on phobias, and I was flattered by his interest. He
had taken me under his wing and was introducing me to some of his most
exotic phobic patients. The scream reissued from behind his door. Jack
and I stood stockstill, but after a minute of dead silence, Jack knocked
softly. Isaac opened the door, and we saw a man of about fifty, very
well-dressed in a blue suit and red tie, sitting across from him, a
beatific smile on his face. Isaac introduced us to his patient and asked
him to tell us about the new therapy we couldn't help but overhear. "I
am an agoraphobic," he explained. "My biggest fear is crowds, being
hemmed in by a crowd and not being able to escape. Dr. Marks here is
using what he calls 'catharsis' to cure my phobia. I find that when I
let it all out and scream out my terror, I feel much, much better. So I
am imagining myself crowded in the stands at a football match, everyone
standing and yelling, and..." He stood, screamed again for about ten
seconds, and collapsed back into his chair, exhausted but beaming. "Last
Sunday I actually went to a football match, and whenever the crowd stood
and yelled, I stood with them and screamed out my panic. I had a great
time, and I think I can handle the problem better now." Isaac was a
creative therapist. He practiced "exposure" therapy in which, instead of
avoiding the phobic object, the patients were flooded with it. The logic
was that the phobic object was a conditioned stimulus, and if it
occurred without any unconditioned stimulus, such as actual trauma, the
fear would extinguish. The trick was to keep the phobic in the presence
of the phobic object long enough to discover that it was harmless.
Isaac's techniques were extreme, such as locking a claustrophobic in a
closet for two hours, but they worked. After the screamer left, saying
thank you repeatedly, Isaac told Jack and me about

a woman he was treating with flooding. She was a sperm phobic, something
I had not heard of before. Her phobia had exploded, and she now avoided
all contact with males, including her husband and sons. "Her homework
assignment was to wear her husband's dirty underpants all last week, and
this week she is doing well," Isaac told us. Jack Rachman, Hans's
right-hand man, turned out to be my closest friend at the Maudsley. Like
Isaac Marks, Jack was a South African Jewish émigré. Like Isaac, he was
a behavior therapist of renown, and like Isaac his main field was
anxiety. Unlike Isaac or Hans, Jack was not larger than life. He was
shy, humble, easygoing, and uproariously funny. Beneath his quiet
gaiety, I sensed a troubled past, someone who had been to Hades and come
back scarred but stronger. His clinical skill and the understanding he
radiated with his troubled patients seemed to stem from his time in the
underworld.

On the left is Joe Wolpe (1915--1997), a South African psychiatrist who
pioneered behavior therapy. He emigrated to America in 1960 and taught
at Temple University. He befriended me in 1966 and introduced me to
systematic desensitization (Chapter 7). In the center, is S. J. (Jack)
Rachman, my closest colleague during my year at the Maudsley Hospital.

Jack took evolutionary considerations seriously for all the neuroses. He
and Padmal DaSilva introduced me to cases of obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) that fit the preparedness theory of phobias well. OCD
patients have very disturbing thoughts about filth, checking, injury,
and doubt that do not let up unless they engage in a ritual that stops
them, but

only temporarily. The thoughts and the rituals made sense in the
evolutionary history of humans, and so did the objects of phobias:
washing to get rid of dirt, checking repeatedly to make sure the door
was locked or the gas off, thinking and rethinking and rethinking again
in the face of doubt. So preparedness seemed to apply to OCD as well as
to phobia. Preparedness was currently gathering steam at Arne Ohman's
humanconditioning laboratory in Uppsala, Sweden. Pictures of snakes or
scorpions (dangerous in evolution and so "prepared"), which in
themselves do not evoke fear, were paired with electric shocks.
Conditioned fear occurred with only one pairing. This fear was difficult
to extinguish, and even when the electrodes were taken off and shock
could not possibly occur, the photos of snakes and scorpions still
evoked fear.3 Importantly pictures of flowers (evolutionarily not
dangerous) paired with shock had none of these properties. Fear took
many trials to condition and extinguished rapidly---and
rationally---when shock was no longer presented or the electrodes taken
off. This was gratifying to me. It conformed to John Garcia's taste
aversions in rats and exactly paralleled the sauce béarnaise phenomenon:
evolutionarily dangerous, one-trial learning, difficult to extinguish,
and irrational. But Jack introduced me to cases of rare, unprepared
phobias that violated the theory: a blind woman with a plant phobia and
another woman who avoided all brown objects. Both were housebound by the
severity of their phobias, lest they encounter plants or things brown,
neither of which are evolutionarily dangerous---plants and chocolate
seem pretty innocuous in evolution. But they were lifelong phobias, very
resistant to therapy, and highly irrational. We could not explain them
but were eager to find the boundary conditions of preparedness and
phobia and even to overturn the theory if it was wrong, so we published
"Unprepared Phobias: Be Prepared."4 Just as in his scientific work, Jack
bent over backward to be fairminded. He was a wine expert and twice a
month took me to the tastings and then to the follow-up auctions at
Christie's. Jack was a patient teacher and highly articulate about the
properties of fine wine. I started to develop a decent palette and
acquire wine-discussing phrases, such as "raspberry bouquet," "undertone
of motor oil," and "decent ullage for its age." Jack wrote a superb
book, A Matter of Taste,5 under the pseudonym Jacques Durac. (It was
rumored that he had also written a

gardening book by Jacques DuFleur and a betting book by Jacques DuTrac).
Under his real name, he reviewed the book in Behaviour Research and
Therapy, the journal he edited, and unceremoniously panned the wine book
as naive and unscientific.6 I began to have wine dreams. One was
prophetic. I was in fact to speak at Sussex University, and my host
would be Stuart Sutherland, a renowned cognitive psychologist and an
oenophile. In my dream, Professor Sutherland tried to stump me at a
blind tasting with---of all things---a German red wine. I had never even
seen one, and I was not even sure they existed. I did go to Sussex and
in reality, at dinner, Stuart, in front of the entire faculty, presented
me with a red wine to identify. I went through the motions of swirling,
sniffing, and tasting and without a clue confidently asserted, "It is a
red Rhine wine." Which it was! I could not help but recall my
Guggenheim-Godhead dream with increased credulity. Jack arranged a
series of four talks for me to give at the institute, and I was
gratified by the standing-room-only turnout. The institute was not only
England's premier research establishment in psychiatry but also the
premier training institution in clinical psychology. Part of Hans's
claim to fame was his successful battle to allow clinical psychologists
to practice psychotherapy legally, not just as handmaidens to
psychiatrists and other physicians. The result was the institute's famed
MPhil and PhD programs, with the Commonwealth's most qualified young
people competing fiercely to get their clinical training under Jack,
Hans, Isaac, and two dozen other research clinicians. They turned out in
force for my lectures, and I found myself with a gaggle of them at tea
every day in the common room. There I met the femme fatale who would
dominate my life for the next three years. Her name was Suzanne Miller,
and she was a PhD student from Montreal. Jewish, short, perfect of face
and body with sparkling brown eyes, and explosive, she made no bones
about her availability. I was poleaxed. Even with two young children to
raise, the marital bond between Kerry and me had worn thin after ten
years, and we were going our separate ways in London. My single-minded
devotion to my work, which always came way before Kerry and my children,
was one cause. The promiscuity of the swinging sixties in the United
States was another, and the sexual atmosphere at the Maudsley in 1975
made the American sixties look puritanical. Suzanne and I began to
travel

together around Europe, and within a year I had left Kerry and my
children for her. This was a difficult time for me. While swept away by
Suzanne, I was also wracked with guilt. Amanda's and David's futures
preyed on me most. I told David, then five, that divorce meant that I
would never be married to Kerry again, never, not ever, never. "But you
might," he said, looking up at me pleadingly. Unlike me, Kerry soon
landed on her feet. She married Dave Hunter, one of my roommates from
Princeton. Also a philosophy major, Dave was the saintly roommate, the
one who went down to Mississippi and got beaten up in 1964. The rest of
us just talked the talk. After Harvard Law, Dave spent the next thirty
years working in the voting rights section of the U.S. Department of
Justice. At their wedding, I was pleased to hear, they pledged that they
would raise the children "as Marty would have wanted." Dave was an
excellent, fair-minded stepfather to my kids, but Kerry and I would
never be friendly. Eventually both Kerry and Dave became Unitarian
ministers and shared a congregation. I will always feel guilty about my
decision to leave my kids, but without that brash move, Mandy, my next
five wonderful kids, and positive psychology would not have happened. MY
FIRST TRADE BOOK, Helplessness,7 had just come out. I'd spent most of

the previous year writing it and found myself very much at home writing
in plain English and extrapolating from laboratory findings to big
realworld issues. The first half of the book went through the concept of
learned helplessness and the scientific evidence for its existence. The
second half speculated on how helplessness might illuminate real
problems: child development as the rise out of helplessness and how to
accelerate mastery in kids; learned helplessness as a model for
depression and what this tells us about therapy; learned helplessness as
a cause of sudden, premature death. Isaac and Shula Marks hosted a party
to celebrate the publication. During a trip back to Penn, Alan Kors took
me to lunch at the campus bistro, La Terrasse, to celebrate my newly
published book. "I hope your next book is about the opposite," Alan
urged as we parted. DESPITE THE POSITIVE reception that these ideas were
garnering, I had

growing doubts about the looseness of my inferences to human problems

such as depression. It was comforting that the parallel laboratory
procedures for learned helplessness in animals produced parallel
passivity when applied to people, but the Guggenheim Museum dream and
Tim Beck's admonition about wasting my life haunted me. All this came to
a head on a sunny April day in Oxford. I'd been invited to lecture to
the department of psychology on learned helplessness as a model of
depression. The large lecture room was packed to the rafters, and there
was a buzz of excitement as I entered. In the audience I saw some of the
stars of British academia: Jerome Bruner, American expatriate and Regius
Professor; Donald Broadbent, the leading light of information-processing
psychology; Jeffrey Gray, Hans's eventual successor as head of the
Maudsley; Michael Gelder, dean of British psychiatry; and Niko
Tinbergen, Nobelist in ethology. Those in the know (and I was not one of
them) seemed to be expecting some dynamite. The format was
unconventional: rather than simply my sixtyminute talk followed by an
open-question session, a discussant, a young Oxford lecturer named John
Teasdale, had been scheduled. I knew by reputation that he was a most
highly prized student of Hans Eysenck and Jack Rachman, and he was said
to be scholarly and deep, as well as a practicing clinician. He was also
said to be a trenchant critic of learned helplessness. I went through
the mapping of eight symptoms of learned helplessness in the lab to nine
of the symptoms of depression. I went through the fact that depressed
people in the laboratory failed to escape noise and gave up easily on
cognitive problems---without any helplessness induction. Given such a
mapping, I suggested that the belief that nothing you do matters caused
both depression and helplessness. Finally, I suggested that the therapy
and prevention strategies that worked on learned helplessness in the
laboratory should guide the therapy and prevention of depression. My
routine lecture. The audience was clapping enthusiastically as John
Teasdale approached the lectern. "I wish I could share your enthusiasm
for Professor Seligman's argument," John began in a clipped Oxbridge
accent. He was bald and bespectacled, bent over as if from too much
reading, and conveyed the impression of a monk just loosed from his
cell. "But I cannot." He then flayed the model. "First," he said,
"consider a human subject in a helplessness

experiment getting unsolvable cognitive problems. What might he
conclude? 'I am too stupid to solve the problems' or 'the nasty
experimenter has rigged this and made the problems unsolvable?'
Depression usually involves the belief in one's own inadequacy and
accompanying low self-esteem, not the belief in a malign world. "Second,
when is helplessness temporary and when is it general? A laboratory
subject failing to escape noise might conclude that this is just a
laboratory trick and that outside the laboratory or on another day,
problems will be solvable. Or he might conclude, as depressives seem to,
that he will always be helpless and in all situations. The helplessness
model as it stands does not enlighten us at all about this crucial
difference between what depressives think and what normal people think.
"In short, Professor Seligman, like the behaviorists he disavows, does
not do justice to the way human beings interpret their helplessness and
how these interpretations are the key to depression and its treatment.
He would do well to acquaint himself with attribution theory," Teasdale
concluded. I was flabbergasted. Teasdale had crystallized, more
articulately than I had been able to, my central doubts about my theory.
"Dr. Teasdale is right, I think," I replied. "These objections are
substantive and indeed I do not know attribution theory. So I invite Dr.
Teasdale to collaborate with me to dispose of the helplessness theory
altogether if necessary, or better to refine it so that it might better
fit depression." Teasdale, expecting some clever defense, startled
visibly, then said, "I accept." And so John and I began a three-year
collaboration.

Chapter Thirteen

Center for Advanced Study (1978--1979)

WHEN I RETURNED to Penn from England in January 1976, my research group
was swollen with talent, and we were eager to take up John Teasdale's
challenge to the helplessness theory of depression. Three remarkable
women led my feisty research group: Lyn Yvonne Abramson, in cutoff jeans
and outsize tie-dyed blouses, looked like a hippy, which she decidedly
was not. Naturally beautiful, she just didn't much care about what she
wore. Hailing from rural Minnesota, she mixed some Finnish bloodlines
inclined to depression with a dollop of Sioux. She came to Penn as a
graduate student by way of a stellar record at the University of
Wisconsin. She was deep and scholarly, but completely out of keeping
with female graduate students of the era. She was refreshingly
assertive, even loud. Her doe-eyed innocence and enthusiasm carried us
along. They also marked her as the voice and intellectual leader of the
team. Lyn's closest comrade was Lauren Bersh Alloy. Lauren was the rare
Penn undergraduate whose record was so outstanding that she was accepted
as a graduate student. Lauren did not take no for an answer. She was a
tough Philadelphia kid and had inherited "dauntless" genes: her
grandfather's parents were murdered in a Russian pogrom at the turn of
the twentieth century, and as a six-year-old, her grandfather had
journeyed alone, mostly on foot, to England from Russia. Her father,
Phil Bersh, was a well-known, traditionally-minded professor of animal
learning at Temple. Unlike the rest of the graduate student body, she
actually dressed in fashionable clothes, sported a giant diamond
engagement ring, and wore makeup, the very opposite of Lyn. She was
actually Dick Solomon's PhD student but was inseparable from Lyn and
soon fell into my intellectual penumbra. Together Lauren and Lyn would

soon make a discovery that rocked the conventional field of depression.

research group working on the attributional reformulation of the learned
helplessness model of depression. Photo courtesy of Lyn Abramson.

The third member of the triumvirate (this is the wrong-gender word) was
Judy Garber. Judy was fleeing a disastrous graduate student year at
Florida State University. She visited Penn and pleaded with me to take
her on as an unpaid research assistant for redemption. Our agreement was
that if she shined, I would help her restart her career as an academic
psychologist. She did shine and soon proved to be invaluable. She
carried out the mundane duties, such as feeding the rats their daily
chow, but soon became the bookish center of the group.

Lauren Bersh Alloy was Lyn's closet comrade. They went on to win
together the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award of the American
Psychological Association, its highest scientific award, for their
"sadder but wiser" discoveries. Photo courtesy of Lauren Alloy.

Judy was central because unlike the rest of us she came from a
background in social psychology and knew "attribution" theory, which
we---clinical and experimental psychologists---did not. She got us to
read the literature and then led discussions of attribution theory. I
was wowed by her teaching and scholarship, but I was not impressed with
attribution theory. "Attribution" is an ambiguous word that here means
the causal story that a person tells herself to explain an event, and
the theory derives from Julian Rotter's "locus of control" theory.1
Rotter pointed out that when a bad event occurs, one can attribute its
cause either internally to oneself ("I am to blame") or externally, such
as to an event, circumstances, or another person ("He was out to get
me"). When facing inescapable noise or unsolvable problems, one can see
his helplessness as either internal ("I am defective") or external
("This damn problem is unsolvable"). It made sense to us that people who
attributed their failure internally would feel unworthy and lose
self-esteem, whereas people who attributed the cause of failure
externally would not. So far so good. But attribution of blame was only
the jumping-off point of Teasdale's critique. He further wondered when
helplessness would last as opposed to just evaporating and when it would
bleed into everything in one's life as opposed to undermining trying
("response initiation") only in the original setting. Judy pointed us in
the direction of Bernard Weiner's2 refinement of attribution theory.
Attributions need not be confined to the internal or external. The cause
can be thought of as temporary ("I had a hangover") or permanent ("I am
stupid"), as specific to the original situation ("I am bad at anagrams")
or more global ("I can never solve my problems"). So to respond to John
Teasdale, we reformulated the helplessness theory of depression to take
into account the way people think about the causes of their
helplessness. A person who interprets the cause as internal will feel
unworthy and lose self-esteem. A person who interprets the cause as
permanent will be helpless long into the future. A person who interprets
the cause as global will be helpless in entirely different situations.
And crucially, if habitual, this way of thinking is a "depressive
attributional style," internal, stable, and global for bad events: "It's
me, it's going to last forever, and it's going to undermine everything I
do." Nondepressed people who have this unfortunate style, when they
encounter setbacks, will become depressed more easily than people

without this style. I called the style "pessimism" and hypothesized that
it was a risk factor for depression in exactly the same way that smoking
was a risk factor for lung cancer and heart disease. John Teasdale
heartily agreed with us, and with him as a coauthor we published the
theory.3 This became a pattern in my own work: when wrong, I tried not
to get defensive. I acknowledged my shortcoming in print and, if
possible, reformulated or even jettisoned ideas accordingly. I tried to
work with my critics, not against them. Unlike a Broadway show in which
criticism means a flop, in science it is the key to progress. I have
Ludwig Wittgenstein's splendid example here in mind. Wittgenstein's
first book---in which, he confided to Bertrand Russell, he had "solved
all the problems of philosophy"---was grounded in logical atomism.4
Midway through his stormy career, he came to believe that this view of
language---that words can correspond to the logical atoms of the
world---was wrong. In his last major work published after his death,
Philosophical Investigations,5 he recanted and held that the meaning of
a word was just its use in the language, not its correspondence to the
world. While I suspect that Wittgenstein was a bit of a self-conscious
poseur, I believe his openness to changing his mind is the very model of
how knowledge progresses. With the reformulated theory to guide us, we
set out to test it on several fronts throughout 1977 and the first half
of 1978. The critical member of the research team, Chris Peterson, soon
joined us. But before I could really understand just how critical he
was, a year of transformation, 1978--1979, awaited me in California.
Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences sits majestically aloof from
the world atop a live-oak-dotted hill in Stanford, California. It had
been the sought-after destination for young, ambitious scholars going on
sabbatical since it was founded twenty-five years before, and I spent my
second sabbatical there. Dave Krantz, a distinguished mathematical
psychologist, said of it, "It is the first honor I've gotten that wasn't
for my potential." There I realized what my Guggenheim Museum dream
meant, and there I had my heart broken. Suzanne Miller and I rented a
modern house in pricy Woodside, horse and horsefly country in the wild
hills that separated Stanford from the Pacific Ocean. I had left Kerry
and my two children the summer before, and Suzanne and I then rented an
apartment together in Washington THE CENTER FOR

Square in the center of Philadelphia. Ours was a rocky relationship. She
left her assistant professorship at the University of Western Ontario to
be with me and was scouting for her next job. The way other men looked
at her---and, more, the way she looked back---troubled me. I worried
that she was still in the romance market and wanted to trade up.
Perhaps, I hoped, the slow-paced idyllic atmosphere of the center would
settle her down. More than forty of us were in residence, and the cast
of characters included some of the brightest lights of my generation.
Jim Heckman, quiet and shy, would go on to win a Nobel Prize in
economics. Nan Keohane would become president of Wellesley and then
president of Duke. Marina Whitman, professor of economics, would
increase her salary tenfold when she left the center to become financial
vice president of General Motors. Beth Loftus, just beginning her work
on defective memory in eyewitness testimony and in alleged sexual abuse,
started our year off by sending us each a survey about our opinions on
memory. "Do we have all our memories stored up someplace in the brain?"
My reply was typically contentious: "I think we have almost nothing at
all stored. I am a bridge player, and I have looked at the queen of
spades literally half a million times. I only have the foggiest idea of
what she looks like. She is mostly black in color of course, but is she
wearing a crown? Carrying a scepter? I don't know. You could put a pearl
necklace on her, and I wouldn't notice the difference. "Outside the
first-floor men's room in College Hall at Penn," I continued, "is a
large bronze plaque dedicated to the memory of 'Pomp,' Albert Monroe
Wilson, a beloved Negro janitor from the nineteenthcentury annals. I
gave a quiz to the male denizens of College Hall. 'Who is Albert Monroe
Wilson?' Despite passing the plaque several times a day, no one could
identify Albert Monroe Wilson. Memory is overrated, and computer storage
is the wrong model for memory. Unlike any machine, we 'store,' and
perhaps only ever know, the gist of things." Days at the center could be
contentious, but for the most part the place was paradise---picking
fresh figs from the tree outside my carrel for breakfast, writing the
morning away, then heading off on an unscheduled adventure at lunch with
any of the yeasty people who happened to sit with me: Seymour Kety,
Janet Spence, John Whiting, Dick Neustadt, Dave Featherman, Dick
Thompson, or Jim Fries. After

lunch, the director, Gardner Lindsey, hosted my favorite time of the
day, the volleyball game. Gardner had the cushiest of jobs---running the
center. He excused himself after one game, saying that he had to go
write a letter. "D?" I inquired. "I actually got a note about you and
volleyball," he confided, never short of repartee. "I had mentioned what
a powerful spiker you are, and my correspondent said, 'Of course, but
can Seligman set up?'" This stung. I prided myself on setting others up
in volleyball and believed I did the same in science with my students
and colleagues. But others apparently perceived me as being out only for
myself. We were discussing Erik Erikson in a seminar that week, and I
wondered now about the end stage of a successful life, the stage of
generativity. Was I only a spiker? Would I ever truly reach the stage of
setting others up? I came to the center to write a textbook on abnormal
psychology with my friend, Dave Rosenhan. W. W. Norton, the tony New
York publisher, guaranteed us each a substantial income, \$100,000
spread over five years, as an advance. This was the first real money I'd
earned from writing. Dave and I spent hundreds of hours schmoozing about
abnormality, and I spent hundreds of hours in my little carrel
overlooking Palo Alto, reading and writing. The chapters on depression
and anxiety flowed effortlessly, since I'd been thinking about these for
a decade. Some of the other chapters were hard slogs. Psychosomatic
disorders was one. I read my way through a literature filled with
neuromythology and still couldn't put the topic together sensibly. But
the chapter on sex came together, and I ventured a new theory on sexual
disorders. Any new theory is way out of place in a textbook, but I put
it in anyway and refined it in later editions. I proposed that sexual
development has five layers, and each can go awry. The deeper the layer,
the harder it is to change. Layer 1, the very deepest, is gender
identity: feeling like a man or a woman. It gets laid down hormonally in
the third month of pregnancy, and if the hormonal bath is abnormal,
transsexuality---feeling one is a man trapped in a woman's body or vice
versa---results. Layer 2 is object choice: being attracted to members of
the same or the other sex. This too is largely hormonal but gets added a
bit later in gestation, with neuroanatomical consequences. Layer 3 is
sexual preference: the objects (breasts, bottoms) and the fetishes
(feet, pain, children) that turn you on. These are acquired in late
childhood or early adolescence. Layer 4 is sex

role: stereotypically masculine or feminine behavior. This is acquired
socially through childhood and adult experience. Layer 5 is sexual
performance: adequacy in intercourse. Disruption here can happen anytime
in adulthood. These are layers of depth, implying how hard or easy they
are to change, for example in therapy. We have almost no choice about
layers 1 and 2. Sexual identity and sexual object choice are difficult
if not impossible to change, whereas preferences, roles, and performance
are increasingly easier to change. I still believe this theory is
largely true, but as far as I know it has never made its way out of our
textbook and into sex research or the clinic.6 By the middle of 1979,
the textbook was drafted. But this turned out not to be the main event
of my sabbatical. I and most of the rest of the cast were "loners" at
the center. But one group gathered here to carry out a single purpose,
and this group transformed me. These individuals came from, in my view,
a lowprestige part of the scientific jungle---applied social
science---and I had not, in my narrow world of pure experimental
psychology, even heard of any of them. Their purpose was to found a new
field around aging and to make it respectable. "Why," I wondered as I
first got to know them, "does the world need a field of aging?" They
launched a volley of answers back at me, answers I found unsettling.
First, they said that psychology had so-called developmental psychology,
but "development" referred only to infants and toddlers, barely to
adolescents, and not at all to the middle-aged or elderly. This
narrowness rested on the dubious assumption that not much changed after
childhood. Adult development, they contended, was a time of both
continuity and more importantly change. My year at the center and my own
life demonstrated to me that this was true. Second, they said that
mainstream social science had adopted as selfevident a simplistic and
misleading methodology. The routine methods of the mainstream were
experimental and cross-sectional, but the laboratory methods suffered
from the thorny problems of external validity. They got an A for rigor
but a D-- for realism. They rarely captured reality and so were rarely
taken seriously and applied to issues in the world that mattered. "Do
you really believe, Marty, that the response of giving up when loud
noise is inescapable is anything like the response of a mother to the

death of her child or the reaction to unemployment or mandatory
retirement?" Even if they were too polite to confront me directly, I had
enough imagination to harbor exactly these doubts about my own work.
What they contended was wrong with "cross-sectional" methods was an
entirely new challenge for me. All of the experiments I'd done were
cross-sectional; we looked at one time slice and assumed continuity into
the next time slice of a person's life. But aging was a field that
doubted continuity; it suggested that people may change as they age and
that what you find early may not hold later. Cross-sectional studies, my
new colleagues contended, are lazy shortcuts that can result in
completely wrong conclusions. Let's say you want to know the effect of
aging on worrying about money. Further let's say you do a
cross-sectional study of three age groups: people born in 1915, 1930,
and 1945. The results would be clear-cut, with the oldest group the most
worried about money and the youngest group the least worried. You
conclude that worrying about money grows with age. Wrong! The members of
the 1915 group were in their formative teenage years when the Great
Depression hit, whereas those born in 1930 and 1945 became teenagers at
more and even more prosperous times. Financial insecurity is not an age
effect but a "cohort" effect, determined not by age per se but by the
historical moment when an individual happens to hit adolescence. An
alternate method is much better: a longitudinal study that repeatedly
tests the very same people as they age. This would reveal no change in
financial insecurity as those born in 1915 got older and perhaps even a
lessening of their worry about money as they aged. Longitudinal studies
are undoubtedly better than cross-sectional studies, but they are
hideously expensive and labor intensive. Imagine following several
hundred people born in 1915 for fifty years, tracking them down, and
trying to convince them to take the same old questionnaires every
decade. My colleagues' third justification for their new field was
political: the changing demographics of America. The baby boomers (born
between 1946 and 1964) were now the dominant taxpayers and wanted
Congress to fund a science that would tell them how they could age well,
with better physical and mental health. So this aging group gathered at
the center with a clear purpose: to establish a respectable scientific
field, to seduce the best young scientists

into it, and if possible to build support for the fledgling National
Institute of Aging (NIA). This group was indeed trying to seduce me.
Flattered, I began to attend their seminars and did the reading, even
though a year before I would have labeled them "softheaded." I got to
know each of them well. Matilda Riley, a gorgeous silver-haired
seventy-year-old and second in command of the NIA, was their official
boss, but the power behind the throne was Paul Baltes. Paul grew up in
the Rhineland at the end of World War II. His parents had owned a
struggling restaurant and put him to work in the kitchen as a kid. When
Paul was eight, a drunken, belligerent customer was arguing with his
mother at the cash register. Paul came in from the kitchen and talked
the customer down. After that, they sent Paul out to deal with difficult
customers. Paul grew into a softspoken dynamo, the Henry Kissinger of
academic psychology, and I was astonished to find myself, surely a
difficult customer, listening well to his vehement critique of
experimental psychology and even liking him in the process. I started to
sip their Kool-Aid. George Vaillant, a Harvard-bred psychoanalyst and a
proper WASP Brahmin, was by his provenance the group member most likely
to repel me. He had just published Adaptation to Life,7 the life stories
(to date) of the two hundred most "promising" members of the Harvard
classes of 1939 through 1944. He was the custodian of the Grant Study, a
longitudinal study centered on the outlandish idea of investigating what
is right in life as opposed to what cripples life and stultifies growth.
It started with the most privileged and talented young people to
discover what leads to success and what leads to failure. George's
theory of success was "mature defenses." Those Harvard undergraduates
who reacted to setbacks with "immature" defenses, such as denial and
repression, seemed to fail later in life: broken marriages, alcoholism,
and underemployment. Those who reacted "maturely," with humor,
sublimation, or altruism, went on to lead much more fulfilled and
successful lives. This was all too positive for me. It reminded me of
Horatio Alger, Norman Vincent Peale, and the chapel services at the
Albany Academy. It felt like the empty "American" propaganda I was wise
enough to reject in favor of a career working to undo that which
cripples life. George, however, listened well and was charming, humble,
and agreeable, talents that enabled him to interview two hundred Harvard

snobs every five years and remain in their good graces. We shared an
interest in fine wine and befriended Dick Graff, owner of the renowned
boutique vineyard Chalone. George and I were wine groupies, and Dick,
for his part, turned out to be a fervent psychology groupie. The three
of us became the unofficial sommeliers for the center and gave wine
tastings for the class. Dick spent a good deal of time with Suzanne and
me. Suzanne flirted openly with him, and Dick confided to me that she
was the only female he had ever found attractive. I probably should have
taken more notice of her other flirtations, since unbeknownst to me she
had already successfully traded up---to Walter Mischel, professor in the
Stanford psychology department down the hill. Walter was famous for the
ingenious "marshmallow" test.8 He was a polished, wealthy Viennese
émigré and a collector of modern paintings. Within the year, Walter left
his wife, Harriet, for Suzanne, and Suzanne left me for Walter. While I
left the center bereft of family and broken of heart, I had nevertheless
grown scientifically. I began my year there a snobby dyedin-the-wool
experimental psychologist, convinced that the wellcontrolled experiment
was the royal road to truth. After all, no other method isolated the
cause so perfectly. But I had now become convinced that the laboratory
experiment came at too great a cost: the variables workable in the
laboratory were anemic and too often bore only an unconvincing
relationship to the real world. My "aging" friends convinced me that
longitudinal methods undertaken outside the laboratory, observing large
groups of people across time, had better external validity and that the
statistical methods developed for longitudinal studies could also hone
in on cause. Study real people---not just white rats and college
sophomores. Study real outcomes---divorce, depression, cancer---not just
laboratory analogues. Study how real people actually change over time in
their natural habitats. Study well-being in addition to misery. These
seemed like the "right" questions that the Godhead floating over the
Guggenheim Museum wanted me to take on.

Chapter Fourteen

Depression

BY 1980, I was a thirty-eight-year-old bachelor. Having left a wife and
two young children and then been jilted by the woman I left them for, I
had a major depression. I could do the self-diagnosis. I had a sense of
loss, of guilt, and of being a fool. I felt sad much of the time, I lost
twenty-five pounds without trying, and I had trouble concentrating on
work. I was not feeling creative, but I was not completely floored. I
carried on. I was back at Penn, leading my large research team, and it
helped that I had glimpsed a new approach at the center. I was beginning
to act on the new vision. I was not helpless, and I was by no means
hopeless. After all, I told myself, I became full professor of
psychology at the University of Pennsylvania at age thirty-three, likely
the youngest in many years. My research was migrating from the dry,
clear-headed experimental laboratory to the wet complexity of the
longitudinal study of real people as they go through life. A crucial
person was about to bless my life. He appeared because I'd taken a
unique route---experimental psychology followed by Mickey Stunkard's and
Tim Beck's personally tailored psychiatric residency. With the
burgeoning popularity of clinical psychology, my route was becoming
known, and others wanted to follow. This was before there were clear
paths into the world of clinical psychology, so rigorously trained young
academics attracted to the field now wanted to find a way in. This is
how I met Chris Peterson. Chris became my bosom friend and closest
colleague until his untimely death at age sixty in 2012. As a
second-year assistant professor at Hamilton College, he sent me a
handwritten three-page letter:1 "This is not what I really want to do. I

was a math undergraduate and then a social-personality PhD from
Illinois. Now I am trapped in a small college in upstate New York
teaching eight courses a year. Can I come to Penn and re-tool as a
clinical psychologist under your supervision? In exchange I can offer
you my body and my offbeat research mind. Pretty please?" I didn't take
up the body offer (what he meant by this I would never discover), but
his mind was a perfect foil for mine. Chris was big, six-foot-three and
well over 220 pounds. He was shaggy and capacious of mind and of heart.
He may not yet have been a clinical psychologist, but he was a
personality psychologist and a statistician, and he created
questionnaires. "Chris," I said, "we need a test to measure
attributional style. Let's try asking people to rate hypothetical good
and bad events along the three dimensions of personal, permanent, and
pervasive, and let's try to predict who gets depressed." "You really
don't know test construction, do you, Marty?" Chris said with
characteristic patience. "A clever concept is only the very first baby
step, Marty. You don't leap from the concept all the way to predicting
anything. You first have to create many items and show that the items
are 'reliable'---that they correlate with each other. You do this by
winnowing out the poor items. That will take a few months and lots of
people and lots of money. "Then you have to retest people and show that
the test is 'stable'--- that people give roughly the same answers a few
months later. That will take another six months. Only then can you test
'validity'---that attributional style correlates with depression.
Finally, you can go for the bull's-eye, predictive validity---that
attributional style actually picks out who, not depressed now, will
become depressed later. Bottom line: it is tedious work, and you cannot
move at your accustomed near speed of light, Marty." I groaned and asked
Chris if he would lead the project. He, characteristically, said yes.

pounds, was big. He was shaggy, and he was capacious of mind and of
heart. He became my closest colleague and my bosom friend. He is

Psychology Center. Photo courtesy of Mandy Seligman.

After two years of work, we published the Attributional Style
Questionnaire (ASQ).2 It contained twelve well-winnowed questions. Half
of them were about bad events: "You can't get all the work done that
your boss demands of you." The other half were about good events: "You
suddenly become rich." You were to imagine vividly that this happened to
you, and then you were to write down what you felt caused

it. For example, you wrote down "a bad boss" for the scenario of
demanding more work. Then you rated that hypothetical cause on the
crucial three dimensions: EXTERNAL-INTERNAL Is the cause ("a bad boss")
something about you or about other people or circumstances?

You would give "bad boss" a 1. It's not about you at all.
UNSTABLE-STABLE In the future, when you are working, will this cause
again be present?

You would likely give this a 4, 5, or 6 (unless you were thinking about
quitting soon). SPECIFIC-GLOBAL Is this cause something that just
influences work, or does it also influence other areas of your life?

You would likely give this a 1 or 2 unless you brood about it everywhere
you go. As the data on the test were pouring in, Chris posed another
question. "Do people just talking about their lives make the same kind
of attributions that they do when answering a questionnaire that asks
about the causes of hypothetical events?" Oblivious to what this really
meant, I dimly recognized this as an "external validity" issue, just
like asking if an IQ test actually predicts

intelligent decisions in real life. So we asked people who had taken the
test to also describe in three hundred words the worst and best events
they had recently experienced. One young man might say for example, "My
girlfriend, such a moody bitch, dropped me." In three hundred words, it
turns out, people typically make three causal statements. We then gave
the statements to raters, who were blind to the person's other
statements and blind to the individual's results on the ASQ. The raters
would then rate "She is such a moody bitch": The raters gave it 1 for
external, 2 for unstable, and 4 for global. Fortunately, the spontaneous
attributions people make for real events strongly resemble those they
make for hypotheticals on the questionnaire. Chris wrote a manual for
rating spontaneous real attributions,3 which he called content analysis
of verbatim explanations (CAVE), so that other researchers could rate
real speech anywhere, anytime. While I did not realize it then, Chris
had invented a way to discover the attributional style of people who
wouldn't or couldn't take our questionnaires---sports heroes, CEOs,
presidents, and the dead. Using the ASQ, the research team now asked if
mildly depressed students had the depressive style we predicted for
negative events ("It's me, it's going to last forever, and it's going to
undermine everything") and the opposite style for good events ("It's not
me, it's going away quickly, and it's only here and now"). The results
came in gradually and very strongly confirmed the theory: depressed
students had exactly this way of thinking about the causes of good and
bad events that befell them.4 We developed the parallel test for third-
to sixth-grade children, the Children's Attributional Style
Questionnaire (CASQ), and found that depressed children had the same
pessimistic style as depressed adults.5 So far so good, but unbeknownst
to me I had now run deeply afoul of the invisible power in the field of
depression: organized psychiatry. I first sensed this behind-the-scenes
power as an innocent refugee from Cornell, trying to eke out a future as
a hanger-on under Mickey Stunkard's benign auspices at Penn. The
Department of Psychiatry, I found out, was chronically broke, and
without the hard money that the endowed School of Arts and Sciences had,
Penn Medicine (and all major schools of medicine) turned to Congress to
keep afloat. Without huge research dollars (and with an astonishing 57
percent "overhead" tax tacked on), the faculty of the medical
departments would have to give up

most of their research to avoid bankruptcy and fall back on the dollars
that treating patients brought in. The prestigious medical faculty was
chosen for their research accomplishments and not for their exemplary
patient care (just as the prestigious Arts and Sciences faculty was not
chosen for its exemplary teaching). The government came to the rescue in
1946 when President Harry Truman signed the National Mental Health Act.
This salvation was christened with a well-intentioned name---the
National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)---that soon became
misleading: Despite having "health" in its name and founding charter,
NIMH by the late 1970s had become solely about mental illness, and
indeed in 2016 it officially defined its mission as the "understanding
and treatment of mental illnesses"6 without mentioning mental health at
all. You might think this was just innocent semantics, but it was
actually a guild-serving sleight of hand, and a book about positive
psychology must confront it. What is mental health? From a traditional
medical point of view, mental health is nothing more than the absence of
mental illness. So if you are not diagnosed as schizophrenic, depressed,
anxious, or suffering from any of the other three-hundred-plus disorders
in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual (DSM), you are by default mentally "healthy." This is nonsense of
the highest order. From my point of view, mental health is much more
than the absence of mental illness; it is the presence of positive
emotion, engagement, good relations, meaning, and accomplishment
(PERMA). The absence of mental illness does not remotely guarantee
mental health of this kind; nor does mental illness wholly preclude
mental health. The entire field of positive psychology is about this
kind of health and well-being, not about how to avoid illness. I did not
know this, of course, during the 1970s, but NIMH's disowning of health
had vast scientific and economic consequences. As I watched DSM unfold
from a research document into the bible for reimbursement by insurance
companies for psychiatric treatment in the late 1970s, I noticed that
the words "disorder" and "illness" loomed large. "Major depressive
disorder" was now a thing. It was reified. I was puzzled, however, since
I was working not on disorders but on underlying processes (i.e.,
helplessness and attributional style) that might be the basis of a
variety of problems in life, including those DSM now

officially called "disorders." Not only were the processes no longer
funded, but there arose the dogma that mental illnesses were
discontinuous from normality. I suspected, however, that depression was
on the same spectrum as the normal blues. The more of the twenty-one
symptoms (sadness, lack of zest, indecisiveness, weight loss, etc.) in
the Beck Depression Inventory and the more intense each one, the more
depression. Severe depression, moderate depression, and mild depression
differ only quantitatively not qualitatively, just as a midget falls on
the short end of the height continuum. Dwarfism, however, in which body
parts are out of proportion, is a disorder and not just a case of being
very short. The disorder of depression had become, by government fiat,
like dwarfism; it was now declared discontinuous from merely having a
lot of the symptoms of depression. With DSM, the National Institute of
Mental Health was now about disorders and not about the processes that
might be the basis of one or more of them. No justification was
forthcoming for the assumption that depression had now become a
discontinuous disorder, and no public justification was given for the
shift of focus from processes to disorders; it just glided through
unnoticed. But the real reason was to fund the psychiatry guild that now
ran NIMH. The "disorders" became the turf of psychiatry departments, and
the funding from NIMH therefore went almost exclusively into their
coffers. One did not trespass on their turf with impunity and without
obeisance. NIMH brought this to my attention when I applied for a
renewal of my large grant that had sailed through for more than a
decade. My renewal was about identifying depressive attributional style,
which, I argued, amplified helplessness: if one interprets failure
through the lens of personal (it's me), permanent (it's going to last
forever), and pervasiveness (it's going to ruin everything), depression
results. The NIMH branch chief for depression fired a warning shot
across my bow. "Your proposal is about the symptoms of depression. What
does that have to do with depressive disorder, Marty?" Bob Hirschfeld, a
future chair of psychiatry in Galveston, Texas, asked me on the
telephone. He was trying to help me stave off a rejection. We had been
friends for five years and always had been frank with each other, but he
was now talking in a code I did not understand. "Why don't you rewrite
the proposal to be about the disorder, and by the way perhaps you might
enlist and pay

some collaborators from your psychiatry department." Housebroken, I
complied. My grant was duly funded, and my compliance turned out to be a
happy accident. The collaborator we took on from our psychiatry
department, someone who did therapy on disorders, was Lester Luborsky.
Lester was a psychologist who (unlike me) got stranded in the psychiatry
department and therefore was destined to spend his life in a
never-ending struggle for funding. Lester investigated the nuts and
bolts of psychotherapy sessions. He asked, "What does the therapist say,
and how does the patient react?" "We have invented something for
analyzing speech that may help," Chris told Lester and me. Analyzing the
verbiage of psychotherapy sessions seemed like a swamp to me, but not to
Chris Peterson. "For our questionnaire project, we validated the test by
seeing if people actually spoke in the same way that they filled out the
test. So we devised a method for taking every verbatim causal statement
a person makes and rating how pessimistic it was. So when a person said,
'She left me because I am unlovable,' that cause is personal, permanent,
and pervasive; it's very pessimistic. That thought should lead to
momentary sadness and maybe, if it's a style, in the long run to
depression." Lester and I got it and did our first case history
together.7 Mr. Q was a twenty-two-year-old with major depressive
disorder. He had undergone two hundred sessions of psychoanalytic
therapy, and during nine of the sessions, he had a dramatic swing of
mood. We extracted sixty-three statements in which Mr. Q. discussed a
bad event and gave a cause for it from these nine critical sessions.
Four raters, blind to all else, rated each cause for internal, stable,
and global on the 1--7 scale. Two therapists rated the tapes of the
sessions for the exact moment of the extreme mood shifts. So, for
example, Mr. Q said, "I feel bothered \[the bad event\]... I'm comparing
again, and she's stronger than me and brighter than me \[the cause\]."
The four raters agreed: it was internal (Mr. Q was "comparing again"),
it was stable ("again"... "she's stronger and brighter"), and it was
global (it hurt all over). Mr. Q's mood right then dropped
precipitously, as the theory predicted. We contrasted this to Mr. Q
saying, "I feel mad at you \[bad event\]... It's your trivial little bit
of science fiction, of trying to make reality conform to the jargon you
use in your trade \[the cause\]." The raters here also agreed with each
other: it was external (the therapist), it was stable

(the way therapy was done), and it was highly specific (just in the
therapy session). Mr. Q's mood did not change, as the theory predicted.
So we were complying with NIMH's unwritten rule that we start work on
sick people and collaborate with the psychiatry department. We also went
into hospitals and tested certifiably depressed patients and
nondepressed schizophrenic controls, finding that the depressed
patients, but not the schizophrenics, had just the explanatory style we
predicted.8 These findings were not earthshaking. Perhaps depression
caused this pessimistic style, or even more uninterestingly, perhaps the
diagnosis of depression partly depended on the presence of this
pessimism. In jargon this is "common method variance." If we were
getting at the cause of depression, and not just boring correlates, this
pessimistic style should be present before depression strikes, and this
style should predict who will get depressed once bad events strike. (And
even more far-reaching: If we could change this style, would we cure
depression?) Testing causality took us and many other investigators
years, but these predictions were largely born out.9 The basic way to
test this was to look at large groups of people across time
("longitudinal" studies). At "time 1" the researcher measured both
depression and "explanatory" style (by the 1980s we had jettisoned the
nebulous adjective "attributional" and had also begun to call those with
the depressive style "pessimists"). Then the researcher merely waited
for a few months or years and measured both again. At this later time
("time 2"), the theory predicted that the pessimists would have become
more depressed than those without this pessimistic style, taking the
depression at time 1 into account. Dozens of studies tested this and
found it to be true. Pessimists were at least twice as at risk for
depression as time drifted on. Another way of testing the theory was to
wait for a bad event in reality and see if the pessimists became
depressed more easily than nonpessimists given the very same bad event.
This technique is called an "experiment of nature." Jerry Metalsky, my
"grandson" through Lyn Abramson, who by the early 1980s was a professor
at Stony Brook, led a particularly convincing experiment of nature. As
the midterm exam for Stony Brook undergraduates taking introductory
psychology approached, Metalsky asked them what grade they would be
happy or unhappy with. He also measured their explanatory styles and
moods before the midterm. Fifty-three of the students then got a
disappointingly bad grade. The pessimists among those fifty-three became
more depressed than the

rest.10 "IT'S TOO BAD that we don't have a time machine, so we could go
back to before the Great Depression and test these girls for optimism
and pessimism," Glen concluded. I was in Heidelberg, meeting with my
colleagues from the Social Science Research Council's group on aging.
They had successfully seduced me, and I not only drank their Kool-Aid
but attended their gatherings. Glen Elder, boyish but silver-haired and
still looking the Eagle Scout, was the world's leading sociologist of
the family. He gave a paper that afternoon on the longest-running
longitudinal study ever done. It had started before the Great
Depression, when children from Berkeley were interviewed and tested for
their strengths and weaknesses. These children were now about eighty
years old and were still cooperating with the researchers. Almost all
their families went broke during the Depression. Some families, mostly
from the middle class, recovered, but many never did. Glen speculated
that it was the pessimistic women who went under and whose health then
deteriorated, and it was the optimistic women who bounced back and aged
well. "We do have a time machine, Glen," I shouted as I banged on his
bedroom door at five in the morning. The scales had fallen away from my
eyes, and I realized for the first time what Chris had invented.
Bleary-eyed, Glen opened the door, and I burst in, explaining Chris's
new method. "We can go back to the original interviews and CAVE them for
pessimism. What did you call the opposite, optimism? I guess we can CAVE
for that as well." This we did, and the time machine worked. We analyzed
the dusty, archived Berkeley interviews and found that the lower-class
women who aged poorly were pessimists, while middle-class women who aged
well had the opposite explanatory style. As a bonus we discovered
something about how we get our explanatory styles. In 1970, the women,
now grandmothers, were interviewed along with their middle-aged
children, and we CAVE'd both sets of interviews. Explanatory style
correlated significantly from mother to child but not from father to
child. Thus, we discovered, people can acquire their explanatory style
by listening to their mothers explain the bad events that befall them
and then imitating them.11 So my energetic research group, in response
to John Teasdale's

scathing critique, discovered a risk factor for depression: a
pessimistic style of thinking about the causes of setbacks: "It's me,
it's going to last, and it's going to undermine everything." This
brought us right up to the edge of curing pessimism to see if that might
cure depression. But it took us almost another decade before we made
this leap. "MARTY, DEPRESSED PEOPLE are more pessimistic than people who
are not depressed, but who is right?" Lauren Alloy asked me. "It's a
pretty bad world out there. Maybe depressed people just see the world
aright." Then she said, "Lyn and I are going to test this in the lab."
This seemingly innocent idea and their findings ignited a
firestorm---still burning---within the field of depression. You find
yourself seated in front of a green light bulb in my lab. There is a
button in front of you, and Lauren instructs you to find out how much
"control"---from zero to 100 percent---you have over the green light's
going on. You press the button, and the light blinks on. You wait and do
nothing, and the light blinks on. You press the button, and nothing
happens. You keep this up, and try to figure out how much control you
have. The experimenters have programmed the amount of control that is
actually possible. When you have 100 percent control, the light blinks
on if and only if you press the button. When you have 50 percent
control, the light blinks on twice as often if you press the button than
if you don't. When you have zero control, the light blinks on at exactly
the same rate whether or not you press the button. To our surprise both
depressed and nondepressed people were quite accurate in their
assessments when they had some control. The big difference occurred at
zero. Depressed people continued to be accurate: "I have zero control,"
they said. Nondepressed people massively inflated how much control they
had when they were actually helpless: "I have 35 percent control" was
their average answer when they had no control at all.12 In my own
depression at that moment, this rang a bell. Tim Beck and all of
cognitive therapy told me I was distorting reality, believing things
were worse than they really were. But maybe I was accurate about myself
and the world: an abysmal failure at love but a promising success at
work. Maybe I, too, was sadder but wiser. Years hence I had an
opportunity to trade back an ounce of that wisdom for more happiness,
and as I write this today, I am glad to have made it.

Chapter Fifteen

Master Blaster (1980--1983)

"THIS PLACE SUCKS," I said to Alan Kors and Dick Solomon at the Chicken
Dinner Club. "Penn has all the raw ingredients, but they are not baked
into a university. The best conversations of my life were at those
dinners at the Wilson Society. They are what a university is." When Alan
arrived as a faculty member in the early 1970s, he and I waxed nostalgic
about the life of the mind we led as undergraduates at Princeton. He did
history and poetry. I did philosophy and psychology. And we both learned
more than a smattering of physics and math and art and politics sitting
across the dinner table at the Wilson Society from the faculty and the
serious undergraduates in those subjects. Penn had nothing like this. It
had as sparkling a faculty as Princeton, but we never saw each other,
except at the occasional faculty senate meeting in which we debated such
weighty issues as more parking space. So Alan and I formed the "Chicken
Dinner Club," inviting a dozen of the liveliest faculty from across the
whole campus to dine on overcooked faculty club chicken once a month.
Each of us led one dinner's discussion: Jerre Levy on the split brain,
Mark Adams on time travel, Dan Ben Amos on Yiddish humor, Marv Wolfgang
on money and happiness, Alan Kors on Delmore Schwartz, Arnold Thackery
on Newton, Dick Solomon on addiction. Having made our little dent into
raising Penn faculty morale, we tackled a more entrenched problem:
undergraduate philistinism. The whole point, we believed, of a
university education was simply to become an intellectual, to become
serious about the life of the mind. To our dismay, too many Penn
undergraduates, prime candidates once, since they were selected for
their academic accomplishments in high school, soon become
anti-intellectual party animals. They settled into

fraternities, sororities, and dormitories, grouped by age, with no
faculty presence outside class. They soon came to think of class, of
reading, writing, and learning, as an obligation, but they lived for the
real life of Penn---networking and mating---and the two worlds almost
never met. With Dick Solomon for gravitas, we approached Vice Provost
Humphrey Tonkin, a scholar with the peculiar specialty of spreading
Esperanto across the planet. We pushed for a college house in which
faculty lived with the students and created an intellectual and artistic
environment therein. Very aware of the undergraduate morass, the
administration was eager to experiment. It awarded us a building, a
slightly rundown 1950s-era, four-story, ragged-stone affair, which we
named Van Pelt College House. Dick had just gone through a messy divorce
(his second) and was without a home base, so he became the first master
of Van Pelt College. Three years later Alan Kors then paid the price for
this bright idea and became the second master of Van Pelt College. I,
now a bachelor with no home, succeeded Alan in September 1980. I spent
the next three years counseling undergraduates about dating, mating,
bullying, homosexuality, tolerance, racism, and, once in a while, ideas.
I brought distinguished guest speakers to Van Pelt (Norman Mailer found
the students "fucking stupid") and hosted seminars (Alan Kors's reading
his own poetry was an overflow smash hit). We housed distinguished
academics visiting Penn on sabbatical. Two British philosophers, the
cigar-smoking Elizabeth Anscombe and Peter ("Logic is the sword of God")
Geach, graced us with their presence for a year. They were
argumentative, even truculent. This seemed a great opportunity for me to
get back in touch with modern philosophy, so puppylike I attended
Anscombe's undergraduate lectures. "The word," she announced, "is merely
a printer's artifact." Her theory of language built on this premise.
After she spun out her theory, I injected some empirical psychology into
the argument. "If it's an artifact, why then do children first speak in
single words?" I queried. Anscombe ignored the question, and Geach
looked very annoyed. At cocktails that evening, Geach stormed up to me.
"I don't give a damn what is in your books, Sir." So ended that attempt
at reengaging in philosophy. I didn't try again until three decades
later, as I tried to move psychology toward a science of the future.

I FOUND THAT I could make deep contact only with the most serious

students. Robin Forman was a mathematical whiz and a member of a band
that did The Doors almost as well as The Doors themselves. His band
played at my "Master Blasters," the master's open house I held
periodically with loud music in my attempt to appear less geeky to my
students. Robin bore an uncanny resemblance to my college roommate
Wilfrid Schmid, Princeton valedictorian of 1964, now gone off to parts
unknown. "Harvard mathematics is my first choice, and I just got
accepted, but with \$5,000 minus tuition," Robin said, exuding
disappointment, when he came to me in April for advice. "That is an
amazing coincidence," I replied. "My roommate, Wilfrid, also first in
our class, applied to Harvard almost twenty years ago and was only given
\$5,000 minus tuition. He asked my advice, and I told him to phone the
chairman of math at Harvard and tell him confidently, 'Perhaps, you
don't know who I am.' Wilfrid did this and was promptly given a full
fellowship at Harvard. Phone the chairman of math at Harvard and tell
him, 'Perhaps you don't know who I am,'" I suggested. "I phoned the
chairman of math at Harvard and said exactly those words," Robin
reported back to me the next day. "Wilfrid Schmid is the chairman, and
he gave me a full fellowship." was the hardest job I'd had since selling
magazines as a teenager. I rose to the occasion as a salesman, earned a
lot (for a teenager), and, most importantly, learned how to sell, a
skill that I used all the time. But I did not rise to the occasion as a
housemaster. As a lecturer my words were finding a large audience among
the students. I was teaching introductory psychology and abnormal
psychology to, frankly, rave reviews, and I began to think of myself as
a teacher. Three years of daily---and nightly and midnightly--- contact
with the undergraduates convinced me otherwise. One-on-one, my
job---trolling and proselytizing for the life of the mind---did not
succeed with the average Penn student. Nor did their issues make contact
with me. I gave popular Master Blasters for the students, and I began to
notice that I failed at these conversations more and more, particularly
at these parties. I'd never been good at small talk and attributed this
to my lack of empathy or slowness of repartee. But another candidate
suggested itself. BEING A HOUSEMASTER

I volunteered for a "signal detection" experiment in an acoustic
chamber. I put on earphones and waited for the "ready" signal. I waited
and waited. Finally, the door opened, and the experimenter dismissed me,
suggesting that I go to the hospital and have a hearing test. I didn't
hear even the loud ready signal. The hearing test confirmed that I was
quite deaf. My guess is that my deafness dates back to about age twelve,
since I know the lyrics of the rock songs only through 1954 ("Ohhh, yes,
I'm the great pretender, laughing and gay like a clown"). So while I had
a bit of a physical excuse for my social ineptness at parties, this did
not help my lack of rapport with ordinary undergraduates. By the time I
stepped down in May 1983, my selfidentity had morphed from teacher of
young people to teacher of their elders: graduate students, postdocs,
and professional psychologists. Moreover, I considered myself a failure
as housemaster---the only job I ever had that I completely failed at. IF
SERVING AS housemaster weren't bad enough, Randy Gallistel, the

newly elected chairman, asked me to take the most thankless job in the
psychology department: director of clinical training. This post had a
very troubled history that explains the tightrope I walked for the next
fifteen years. Clinical psychology was the orphan of the great academic
departments of psychology. At the decisive 1946 meeting of the Society
of Experimental Psychologists, the chairmen of Harvard, Princeton, and
Penn declared that they would hire no applied psychologists, and
psychology would be a basic science, just like physics. They would bring
on no more clinical or industrial psychologists, only psychologists who
studied basic, underlying processes. The rest of the prestigious North
American departments followed suit. This coincided, however, with
massive funding pushing psychology in the opposite direction: the
National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) began to award grants for
research on mental illness, and the Veteran's Administration began to
hire psychotherapists to treat psychologically wounded soldiers. At the
same time as receiving the injection of funds that clinical psychology
brought to otherwise strapped psychology departments, the basic academic
researchers looked down their noses---with good reason---at these
upstarts "pretending" to apply science to troubled people. The good
reason was that the therapists were all Freudians---Freud was the only

game in therapy-city---and the academics were empirical scientists, the
archenemies of the empirically untethered Freudians. This cast a shadow
of suspicion over even those people, like Hans Eysenck, Joe Wolpe, Jack
Rachman, and Norman R. F. Maier, who did respectable empirical science
but applied it. This shadow was (and still is) the basic source of
contempt, tension, and misunderstanding between experimental and
clinical psychology on the one hand and between psychology and
psychiatry departments on the other. Of all American psychology
departments, Penn's was just about the most contemptuous of application
when I arrived in 1964, and little changed over the next decade. It
included a smattering of clinical graduate students, looked down upon as
inferiors by the mathematical psychologists and natural scientists. It
was the booming voice of one faculty member, Julie Wishner, the director
of clinical training, who I heard opining, "On balance, Seligman should
be tenured." Julie had migrated from the frying pan of the psychiatry
department, chafing at his second-class citizenship there, only to find
himself in the fire of being an applied psychologist in the least
applied of psychology departments. In order to make any headway in this
lonely role, he had to out-science the scientists. So he adopted the
posture of a psycho-physiologist, who just happened to be interested in
schizophrenia, and bad-mouthed the looseness of clinical thinking at
every public opportunity. This might have worked before the days of Bob
Bush and the very sharp group Bob recruited, but the new guys saw
through Julie's act, and the prestige of clinical psychology at Penn
sank to a new low. At the same time as clinical psychology became the
sick man of the department, the science behind it (and behind social
science generally) was actually getting much, much stronger. When hired
in 1972, I had the experimentalists' support (albeit with mixed
feelings), because they hoped I was a natural scientist at heart. I had
the support of Julie Wishner and the social science wing because the
natural scientists ("natural science" being the Penn psychology
department's official designation) had certified me kosher but they
hoped I was an applied social scientist at heart. Unlike in the 1960s,
when it hired toadies, in the 1970s Penn made junior appointments that
greatly raised the scientific profile of my young, applied colleagues.
Ruben Gur, an Israeli war hero, along with his MD/PhD wife Raquel,
worked at the intersection of neuroscience,

anxiety, and schizophrenia. Myrna Schwartz pioneered the new cognitive
science to identify the locations of brain damage after a stroke. These
individuals did unimpeachable science, but their applied slant tainted
them in the eyes of the department. When Ruben and then Myrna came up
for tenure, the natural scientists slaughtered them, even though
inferior pure experimental scientists got promoted with relative ease. I
worried that we were becoming a department of the retina rather than a
department of psychology. Ruben and Myrna got such unfair treatment that
I contemplated quitting and interviewed at NIMH for a laboratory chief's
job. Their fate was a warning to me as I thought over Randy's offer. If
I became director of clinical training, I could no longer straddle the
natural and social sciences or basic and applied science. In the
zero-sum game of hiring new professors, I would become, in the eyes of
my natural science colleagues, a defector, a relentless and annoying
advocate for applied social and clinical science. I'd watched a decade
of this losing battle in department meeting after department meeting. I
would have to sacrifice what local prestige I had accumulated and become
a whipping boy. But at bottom, and in this case decisively, I believed
that scientific psychology is meaningful only if it applies to human
problems. This was the unspoken bone of contention in my last
conversation with Bob Bush before his suicide. When Bob said that if I
was right, he had "wasted his life," we were arguing about the
fundamentals. For Bob mathematics was the king of psychology, and the
experimental method was the queen, just as in physics. But for me,
psychology first needs to discover sound premises that researchers can
only then mathematize and experiment upon. These premises get discovered
not from the bottom up but from the top down based on what actually
works in the world. Psychology had no convincing application to human
problems, so what got considered "basic" was, to put it gently,
arbitrary and untethered from reality. Wanking, basically. My thinking
about Pavlovian conditioning and instrumental learning as "basic"
processes convinced me of this. What made work on these processes so
appealing was the possibility that they might underlie human learning:
this was a decent a priori guess, and huge effort (some of it mine) was
devoted to understanding both of them. Indeed, these were the premises
that Bob Bush had mathematized in his life's work.

But such effort was only worthwhile if these processes actually do
underlie human learning. If it is not worth doing, it is not worth doing
well. To test out that it was worth doing, one needed to reconstruct, to
synthesize real learning from these basic "elements." So, for example,
take bridge, an instance of actual human cognition. Computer programs
that rely only on associations do not get very far playing bridge. Their
brute-force approach of merely piling one association on another is too
lengthy and too cumbersome. The bridge brain does not work like this.
The computer must take radical shortcuts and generate only a few likely
hypotheses (e.g., this is either an endplay or a finesse), then test the
evidence in order to win at bridge. Brute-force associationism does not
work well at chess either. Or in language learning. Or in concept
learning. Or in intuition. Or even in perception. So I was still waiting
for any convincing evidence that instrumental learning or Pavlovian
conditioning were the building blocks of human learning. Without it, I
did not believe that these processes warranted great investment. Almost
all the fiery tussle of department politics was about whether to hire
this basic scientist or that applied scientist, and voices for the
former consistently won---even when the basic science was untethered
from reality. So becoming the advocate of applied psychology may have
been a losing battle, but it was my battle. I accepted Randy's offer,
and this was the point of no return. Indeed, as I expected, I tried, in
one heated faculty meeting after another over the next two decades, to
persuade my basic science colleagues to hire talented applied
psychologists, and I usually lost the vote. It was a source of 4-a.m.
teeth grinding and the gradual erosion of my influence and even some of
my friendships. Being born a decade or two after 1942 would have made my
job a lot easier, since by about 2010 the corner was turned, and the
importance of applied work in psychology dawned (or was forced by
undergraduate demand as well as congressional funding) on basic
experimental psychologists. The Psychonomic Society, a most intransigent
bastion of basic research, came out in favor of "Pasteur's Quadrant,"
the notion that applicable, but nevertheless very rigorous, research was
highly desirable. The British government by the turn of the millennium
decided to evaluate and fund its academic departments by impact as well
as the traditional, more inbred criteria. (Oh, had I only thought to
argue for "impact" rather than "application.") As a result, the great
British departments were now snapping up the psychologists they

once would have shunned. As I write, a distinguished clinical
psychologist occupies the venerable chair of experimental psychology at
hoary Oxford. But "I told you so" is one of the least satisfying phrases
in the lexicon. MY RESEARCH TOOK some very new turns: one was my first
venture into

the world of business, and the second was predicting sports. My old
research team had gone the way of success, with each of the leaders
getting the best academic jobs: Chris Peterson became associate
professor at the University of Michigan (and eventually director of
clinical training and chaired professor), Lyn Abramson became assistant
professor at Stony Brook (and eventually chaired professor at the
University of Wisconsin, her alma mater), Lauren Alloy eventually filled
her father's shoes as chaired professor at Temple, and Judy Garber went
to Minnesota, where she finally got her PhD (eventually becoming a
chaired professor at Vanderbilt). My pride in their accomplishments and
my expectation that they would carry forward the future of depression
research dwarfed my temporary sadness at the loss of their company just
down the hall. A new generation of young scientists who wanted to work
with me on the topic of control was forming. "This is what I want to do
with my life," said Peter Schulman. I was teaching abnormal psychology
and usually gave an A+ to the best two or three students out of three
hundred Penn undergraduates in each class. Along with the A+ I
volunteered to help them in their careers. Peter got one of the A+s and
came to me to do the volunteering. "I don't want a PhD; I want to help
your vision become reality." Peter became my research coordinator,
eventually managing a staff of fifty people and several
multi-million-dollar grants. He created structure out of my
throw-ten-balls-in-the-air (and-hope-two-will-bounce) approach to
science. He was my right arm, the one indispensable person in my
scientific life. Without Peter, who is still a crucial part of my life
in 2018, I would have retired years ago, since I cannot bring myself to
do what he does: negotiate with bureaucrats, broker peace between
sparring interests, write progress reports that no one will read, deal
with ethics boards, and wade through the swamp of policy in order to
help me operate at near light speed.

"Marty," Peter told me just the other day, "what you find soul
shriveling and avoid, I find soul enhancing and embrace." MY FRIENDS IN
"AGING" worked by "old-boy" networking, and I found

myself a beneficiary. Jack Riley was the husband of Matilda Riley, the
second in command at the National Institute of Aging and organizer of
the group at the Center for Advanced Study. Jack thought well of me and,
unbeknownst to me, was wealthy and influential. He wanted to make me
wealthy, a prospect I had never even entertained.

I received a mysterious invitation to the Rockefeller Estate in

Pocantico Hills for the annual meeting of the heads of the big insurance
companies. Jack phoned me and told me to accept, which I did. I was
impressed by the influence on parade. The CEOs came in limousines,
except for the CEO of Prudential, who came by helicopter. I led a small
discussion group, and John Creedon, the CEO of Metropolitan Life,
befriended me. John listened well and asked me whether pessimistic
people fail more at work. He told me he couldn't abide the pessimists at
Met Life, who got in his way whenever he wanted to do something new. He
also mentioned that his salesmen were quitting in droves and that Met
Life had a huge retention problem. I had never been this close to a CEO
before and was flattered. I was also impressed by John's humility and
curiosity. A few weeks later, I came home from a long day at the office
to a ringing telephone. It was a life insurance salesman, and I hung up
on him as soon as I figured this out. As I was putting the phone down,
it occurred to me what a tough job he had. How did he cope with
rejection after rejection? I wrote John and asked him how Met Life
inured its salesmen to near-perpetual rejection. He phoned and asked me
to come to New York to chat. "We hire five thousand new salesmen a year,
Marty," said John, "and it costs us five thousand dollars to train each
one. Half of them quit in the first year, and by the end of three years,
eighty percent are gone. Almost no one can take all the rejection." "So
how do you select your salesmen?" I asked. "We have an IQ of life
insurance, called the Career Profile. It asks, 'Do you want to make a
lot of money?' 'Do you like to go to parties?' and 'Do you have a lot of
relatives?' If you pass, we offer you the job. You mentioned that you
have devised a test for pessimism. I wonder if this would help our
selection process." "It does predict who will get depressed in the face
of setbacks---the pessimists. So maybe it's the optimists who can brush
off rejection best," I ventured. "Would you try it on some of our sales
force? We'll pay you to do it." Peter Schulman and I went to work. First
we found that the top salesmen were much more optimistic on the ASQ than
the worst salesmen. Of course their success could be making them more
optimistic rather than their optimism making them more successful. So
Met Life underwrote a longitudinal study with three groups, one

group very risky indeed. The first group included the five thousand
regular salesmen hired after passing the Career Profile. They had also
taken the ASQ on being hired, so we could track their sales as a
function of optimism as well. Second, Met Life hired a group of about
one hundred salesmen who had failed the Career Profile and done badly on
the ASQ, but the managers liked them and thought they had great sales
potential. Third, Met Life hired 140 extreme optimists who had failed
the Career Profile and did not have the managers' endorsement. They
would not have been hired without the study. These were Frankensteinian
optimists, since even a "pessimistic" life insurance salesman was way
above the national average in optimism. Real pessimists do not apply. We
followed their sales for three years and found that among the regular
force, the optimists outsold the pessimists. We also found that the
salesmen who only had the managers' endorsement and did badly on the
tests failed abysmally. Most importantly, the special force of extreme
optimists outsold everyone; at the end of three years, they were still
banging away. So Met Life adopted the ASQ for regular use in hiring its
sales force ---and paid me royalties. "I'm rich!" I announced to my
mother on the phone. MY FIRST VENTURE into sports followed from the
mechanism of learned

helplessness: not trying. A person's belief that nothing he does makes
any difference erodes voluntary response initiation. He thinks, "Why
bother?" and conserves energy, not attempting difficult voluntary
actions. Thus, after defeat, pessimistic individuals will not try as
hard and so will do worse than they usually do. "Whom should we put in
the relays?" Nort Thornton and Karen Thornton, the coaches of the US
Olympic swimming teams, asked me in 1987. "Bitter experience tells us
that the routine move of just putting our fastest swimmers in does not
work. The relays follow the individual events, and sometimes if a
swimmer---even a great swimmer---flops in the individual events, he \[or
she\] does very badly in the relays. Can you predict who will collapse
and who will rise to the occasion after doing badly in the individual
events?" I put this question to Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, newly arrived
after finishing at the top of her undergraduate class at Yale. Bob
Sternberg, my friend and a professor at Yale, wrote me privately during
the admission

process and opined that Susan was "headed for greatness." (She
eventually became full professor at Stanford and finally at Yale.) Susan
had open-heart surgery as a child, and I sensed a fragility about her,
underneath her steely exterior and indefatigable work ethic. "You used
the ASQ to predict life insurance success," Susan said, "so let's use it
to predict Olympic swimming. The pessimists might, like rejected
salesmen, collapse after defeat, and the optimists might just be
energized after defeat." With Susan, the coaches gave the ASQ to the
male and female candidates for the US teams for the 1988 Olympic Games
in Seoul, South Korea. The coaches then had swimmers go all out in their
best events, then told the swimmers their times were slow by just enough
to be undetectable but very disappointing nevertheless. Each swimmer
rested up and swam the same event again. As predicted, the pessimists
swam the second event about 1 percent slower, and the optimists swam the
second event about 1 percent faster.1 Nort and Karen used this in Seoul,
and the United States swept the relays. Karen Reivich led our next foray
into professional sports. Karen was already an undergraduate legend by
the time I met her as a student in my huge abnormal psychology course. I
knew about her from Penn's director of admissions: in the year she
applied, applicants were required to write an essay about the world
problem they would solve. Karen wrote her essay about "static cling," an
issue trumped up by Madison Avenue to sell laundry detergent. She
succeeded Peter Schulman as my A+ student and entered my laboratory
after she graduated. The Olympic swimmers were kind enough to take our
questionnaire when asked by their coaches. But most sports heroes,
professional basketball players and major league pitchers, would not
take questionnaires. So Karen decided to use the CAVE technique on
sports page quotes to get their explanatory style. This was immensely
tedious, requiring reading the sports pages daily in dozens of national
and hometown newspapers for a whole season and extracting and rating
every causal statement a player made. Karen was up to the task. For
baseball, Bill James, in his encyclopedic books, had assembled exactly
the statistics we needed. We predicted that in tight games, pessimistic
pitchers would do worse than they usually did, whereas optimistic
pitchers would do better than usual. So Karen formed a CAVE profile on
major-league pitchers from sports page quotes in the first

season and then looked at their earned run average (ERA) during the
final three innings of close games in the next season. We found that
pessimistic pitchers got worse (their ERAs went up) in the final innings
of close games, whereas optimistic pitchers showed the opposite: they
got better (their ERAs went down) in the final innings of close games.

We then tried to predict professional basketball: we took two teams from
the National Basketball Association (NBA)---the Boston Celtics and our
hometown Philadelphia Seventy-Sixers---and we CAVE'd all the sports page
quotes from the first season for both teams. The Sixers turned out to be
dire pessimists, while the Celtics were sunny optimists. We then looked
at the next season and had a tool even better than Bill James's
statistics for baseball: handicappers for each NBA game. When one places
a bet on a basketball game, one tries to beat the "line," the margin by
which the handicappers predict that the team will win or lose. So, for
example, the Celtics were basically better than the New York Knicks, and
in a given game between the two, handicappers might predict that the
Celtics would win by eight points, the line. If you bet on

the Celtics, in order to win you had to bet that they would beat the
line (e.g., that they would win by nine or more points). The line was an
exquisite target for us since it took into account all known advantages
and disadvantages---for example, the home court advantage or the
disadvantage of an injured player. It did not, however, take into
account the teams' pessimism or optimism. So we predicted that an
optimistic team, in this case the Celtics, after a defeat would rise to
the occasion and beat the line, whereas the pessimistic Sixers would
collapse after a defeat and lose to the line. This was exactly what
happened. After all the hundreds of hours of reading sports pages, we
discovered one more fact. For the Celtics and the Sixers, we need not
have worked so hard. Just CAVEing the coaches would have sufficed. The
Celtics' coach was an optimist, and the Sixers' coach was a pessimist.
So maybe the players got their explanatory style from their coach, and
merely knowing about the leader, generally, would predict the
performance of followers. THE OTHER ADVANCE in my research program had
to do with cancer and

helplessness. Joe Volpicelli and Madelon Visintainer joined my group
from the world of medicine. Joe was a Penn MD, a genuine South
Philadelphian from a line of proud Italian stonemasons. Madelon was a
committed nurse-practitioner from the University of Utah who aimed to
make nursing a research-based academic profession. Both believed that
helplessness weakened and mastery strengthened the body. I had collected
more and more anecdotes in which helpless patients died suddenly and
unexpectedly, in contrast to optimistic, masterful patients who beat all
the odds and lived despite dire prognoses. But anecdotes are not
science: they may be highly exaggerated and, even if truly reported, can
involve many other uncontrolled factors. So Madelon and Joe carried out
a pioneering rat experiment using the triadic design to test whether
helplessness and mastery influenced tumor growth. Each of three groups
of rats got the usual escapable, inescapable, or no shock experience.
But before any shock occurred, a malignant tumor with a known "take
rate" of 50 percent was implanted on each rat's flank, and thereafter
tumor growth was observed. Of the rats that had no shock, 50 percent
rejected the tumor, and 50 percent grew the tumor and died. Of the rats
that had inescapable shock, only 25 percent rejected the

tumor, and 75 percent died. Of the rats that had escapable shock, the
results were reversed: 75 percent rejected the tumor, and only 25
percent died.2 We published the resultant article in the journal
Science. It was the only one bearing my name---out of about ten lifetime
submissions---that made it into this prestigious venue. Perhaps this was
the price of being an adventurous interloper. I have a lifetime batting
average (articles accepted by the top journals or grants funded) of
about .333. That's a good average for baseball but not for science. In
contrast, my colleague Bob Rescorla, a scientists' scientist, has a
batting average of 1.000. As far as I know, he has never had either an
article or a grant request rejected. How to explain this vast
difference? It is assuredly not because Bob is an optimist---he is not.
Rather I think it goes back to Peter Madison's admonishment at Princeton
about not being wrong versus not being boring. I've attended faculty
meetings with Bob for decades. He has very strong opinions, but he
rarely talks, and when he does, everyone listens because he almost never
says anything false. He founded the modern field of Pavlovian
conditioning and is the best Pavlovian ever, better even than Pavlov.
But his field has shriveled and is now dying. Bob retired, resting on
his laurels. He did unimpeachable, conclusive science. Few Pavlovians
would get into the ring with Bob, and he never tried to reach beyond his
grasp. He never tried to extend Pavlovian conditioning beyond its narrow
confines. Bob chose not to be wrong. One of his critics said, "Bob is
the brightest dull person I ever met." I am forever reaching beyond my
grasp. I want to know the furthest boundary of my idea. I often turn out
to be wrong, but I am resilient and an optimist about my own work. One
of my critics said of me, "Marty is not afraid to be wrong or to sound
silly." I chose not to be boring. The price of being an interloper who
tried not to be boring was not just a lot of rejection but also a lot of
being ignored. I mentioned before that my learning theory colleagues
never thanked me for learned helplessness or for preparedness, and they
mostly reacted by ignoring the findings. The tumor-growth article
demonstrated conclusively that psychological factors strongly influence
malignancy, but the very same thing happened, as impeccable as it was. I
thought it was stunningly important, but it was barely followed up
(ranking only ninety-fourth in citations of all my three hundred
articles), and it forked no lightning.

Chapter Sixteen

Mandy (1988--)

MANDY MCCARTHY SELIGMAN is the love of my life. She is the mother of our
five children. After thirty years, when I wake up by her side, I am
still thrilled to see her. She turned my personal life around and then
was the muse who turned me sunward toward positive psychology. And yet I
have never written her a love letter. This is it. IN MAY 1983 my term as
master of Van Pelt College House was up, and I

was glad it was over. The lack of privacy and the continual demand at
any hour entailed by living with 180 undergraduates---and as many
crises---wore me to a frazzle. More than anything, I craved privacy, but
I did not crave solitude. I began to look at houses on the Main Line,
the leafy western suburb of Philadelphia. There was a lot of space and
privacy there. America's latest oil crisis was in full swing, with cars
lined up at gas stations and consumers no longer buying gas-guzzlers.
The prices of Main Line houses plummeted, since the prospect of heating
a huge home with no insulation made them white elephants. A real estate
agent told me that a "Tudor" built in 1926 by Wallace & Warner, noted
local architects of the Roaring Twenties, was coming on the market soon.
A more accurate term for its style was "stockbroker bucolic" since this
was one of the houses built before the Great Depression to accommodate
the large wealthy families from the city on their summer vacations.
Woodleigh was a six-bedroom, ten-thousandsquare-foot pile with a marble
entrance hall and a green marble staircase. The thirty-foot living room,
roofed with the darkest of African violet

timbers, had perfect acoustics and served as a chamber music setting
when Eugene Ormandy, conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, occupied
the house in the 1940s. It had a winding two-hundred-foot driveway and a
row of eight eighty-foot silver beech trees and a hundredfoot oak tree
that antedated the house. The smaller trees were entirely overgrown with
vines that looked predatory enough to eat human beings.

Mandy McCarthy Seligman is the love of my life. We married in 1988, and
my life turned positive---finally. Photo courtesy of the author.

The owner was Martin Weinberg, the Philadelphia city solicitor and
manager of Frank Rizzo's losing campaign to return to his old job as
mayor in 1982. Marty was eager to get rid of the huge house. He told me
he had never even ventured into the cavernous basement. The house felt
like it wanted to be rid of him too so that both it and its present
occupant could get on with their lives. Even with oil-crisis prices, I
still couldn't afford it. The down payment was \$50,000. I had not even
saved \$10,000. Irene came up from her small, cheaply furnished condo in
Del Ray Beach, Florida, and scrutinized the house. She scratched her
fingernail over the checkerboard marble flooring and suggested that it
was faux marble (it was not). I was surprised, however, and overwhelmed
with gratitude and love when she wrote me a check for \$50,000. This
must have just about exhausted her life savings. She told me that the
best use of money was to give it away exactly when it could make a
crucial difference in one's children's lives. I remembered this and
followed her example later. It was wildly impractical, a bachelor's
folly, but I bought the house anyway, believing that I would meet a
woman who would fill it with kids and with dogs and with love. The house
resisted me. It rained for the first cheerless ten days of my occupancy
in May 1983. When the rain finally stopped, I started to rip down the
vines on the smaller trees. They did not like this, and I ended up at
Lankenau Hospital with poison ivy over 60 percent of my body. I
recovered and went off to the Max Planck Institute in Berlin for the
summer.

Seligman.

I returned to discover that the swimming pool leaked perpetually. I
could not stop the leak and sued Marty Weinberg for \$2,500 for
disguising it. He showed up at common pleas court with a retinue of his
firm's lawyers. The justice of the peace told him summarily, "Pay the
man." This justice of the peace would officiate at my wedding to Mandy
five years later. I got the heating bill for February. I called the
Philadelphia Electric Company to ask if they had made a decimal point
error. They had not. IN SEPTEMBER 1984 my life turned positive. The new
crop of graduate

students arrived at Penn. I attended the opening dinner in an off-campus
Chinese restaurant and noticed a lovely, petite blonde at the other end
of the table, ten seats down. She had almond-shaped blue eyes, a
sprinkling of freckles, and a striking resemblance to a slimmer Shirley
MacLaine. She did not speak to me then, but she made an appointment to
talk about her first-year project. We sat on a slatted red wood bench
outside the laboratory building on a crisp early autumn day to discuss
her research. It was our first conversation, and I can even remember the
rough-hewn feel of the wooden slats. Her voice enfolded me: she had a
British accent, delicate and lilting enough to be soothing, unlike the
jangling argumentative

tones of the Oxbridge philosophers I knew. She spoke in half sentences
and then waited patiently for me to finish them. I eagerly completed her
thoughts---with pleasure. She asked me to be her advisor. I
accepted---eagerly. I snuck a look at her admissions folder. She had an
undergraduate degree in social psychology from Kent (Canterbury) and the
highest Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores I'd ever seen. I asked
her about her remarkable scores, and she told me she could not remember
taking the test, only being in an automobile accident on the way to the
test center---she had sleepwalked her way through the GREs with a
concussion. She did remark that perhaps getting high scores on
multiplechoice exams was genetic. Her father, Dennis McCarthy, had the
highest test scores in the United Kingdom when he escaped the Welsh coal
valley of his birth by taking the national chartered accountant
examinations and so bursting free to London. She then told me a fragment
of her story. (She was reserved, and I am still hearing more fragments
almost thirty years later.) At seventeen, sitting in a London café, she
"knew" she would come to America. She matriculated at Kent and won the
Faculty Prize. She told her advisor that she wanted to go to the United
States, and he told her, "People like us don't go to America." People
like us. This was exactly what she wanted to escape: the helplessness
and passivity that permeated the United Kingdom following World War II
and the yielding up of the empire. She saw it through the eyes of an
aspiring student at just the same moment in time that I was seeing it
through the eyes of a visiting fellow at the Maudsley Hospital in
London. I saw it in the Zen-like forbearance that my British neighbors
displayed when the plumber failed to show up or the mail did not arrive.
Mandy saw it in the resignation that her friends showed when they went
on the dole. She took social psychology at Kent and heard about Martin
Seligman and about learned helplessness. Learned helplessness resonated
deeply, capturing exactly what she saw all around her, and she knew she
was destined to work on it. She heard that one award was available for
study in America. "I am not one of those 'people like us,'" Mandy
thought when she applied. She got the award. She studied the psychology
of language at the University of Indiana with Linda Smith, a Penn PhD,
and a former teaching assistant of mine. Linda told her that she should
go to graduate school at Penn. She went back to Kent to

finish her AB and was admitted to Penn for the PhD. She sat at the long
dinner table ten seats away from me, and another new student pointed me
out. Mandy was surprised, since, somehow, she had not known that I was
at Penn, but here we both were. I found myself in a difficult position
as her advisor, because I was very attracted to her. This was before the
days of rules at Penn forbidding romantic contact between faculty and
graduate students, but gossip and shunning accomplished much the same
end. Nevertheless, such contact, I felt, would undermine any academic
relationship. So I adopted the opposite posture, aloof and severe, more
aloof and severe than with my other students. Aloof and severe did not
work. Mandy was my teaching assistant in abnormal psychology. I came
into one of her classes unannounced and commented benignly (I
thought)---but severely---on some aspect of the latest draft of her
article on anorexia. She frowned. I had blundered into criticizing her
in front of her students. She out-severe'd and out-aloof'ed me by an
order of magnitude. She did not speak to me for a month. Baffled, I woke
up each morning feeling that the bottom had dropped out of the universe.
It dawned on me that I had a case of something bigger than mere
attraction. An abject apology worked better than severe and aloof. Mandy
studied eating disorders and dieting. She combed through the world
literature and found that anorexia and bulimia occur only in cultures,
like ours, that have three things: a thin ideal for women, massive
dieting among females, and twice as much depression in women as in men.
Among cultures that do not have a thin ideal, do not have legions of
women dieting (and failing), and have a one-to-one ratio of depression
in men and women, there is no anorexia and no bulimia. She theorized
that the unrealistic thin ideal for women caused eating disorders: women
overdiet to achieve the ideal, and vulnerable females then cascade into
bulimia and anorexia. The two-to-one ratio for depression results from
females' distress over their body images and failure to achieve the
unnaturally thin ideal.1 This theory was widely cited over the next
decade, but Mandy became the only psychologist I know who did not return
the New York Times's phone calls. In May 1987, I gave a talk at
Dartmouth on my new theory of dreaming. But I could not concentrate
because I had at long last invited Mandy to dinner. I intended to drop
the aloof posture and tell her how I

felt. I did, and she asked, "Will you be my advisor in the morning?" I
said that I would not. We flew to England. Her father, Dennis, and I
went "down the pub," and I asked his permission to marry Mandy. I was
seventeen years older than his daughter, he reminded me, and once
divorced. Not exactly the ideal groom. He suggested that we wait one
year before marrying but consented to my proposing now. I took Mandy to
Le Jardin, a restaurant in Soho with London's most celebrated cellar of
very old clarets. I had my mother's diamond engagement ring---the one
from Adrian---in my pocket. The evening, however, refused to come off
flawlessly. I looked over Le Jardin's legendary wine list, and the
sommelier and I had a long and pretentious discussion. The corks in 1945
had gone bad because of the war, the Pauillacs did not age as well as
the St. Estephes, and so on. I could not seem to rein myself in and
focus on the main event. I ordered a 1949 Lynch-Bages. It was very
expensive and their last bottle. It was brought out with great ceremony
and skillfully decanted. I swirled, I swirled again, I inhaled, and I
sipped. It was far gone, over the hill. The sommelier, with aplomb,
whisked it away. The patrons nearby noticed this and glanced our way
surreptitiously. The sommelier handed me the list, and once again we had
an overly long discussion of the merits of the 1945s, 1947s, and 1949s.
I couldn't shut up. He couldn't shut up. I chose a 1947 Calon-Segur.
More ceremony, cork sniffing, and decanting. The other patrons were
staring openly. Oh my God, this one is also bad. Could I restrain myself
and just accept it? Of course not; I enumerated its defects. This time
the sommelier tasted it before sending it away. Mandy seemed
uncharacteristically impatient. The wine list again. The discussion.
"Third bottle," the sommelier said, "you pay half no matter what." I
agreed and ordered the 1949 Talbot, not the greatest but the
longest-lived of clarets. The ceremony, the decanting, the cork
sniffing, and all the nearby patrons now no longer eating and staring.
The Talbot was perfect, heavenly in fact. The sommelier relaxed, Mandy
relaxed, and the room broke into polite applause. I dropped to my knees
and took out the ring. Mandy beamed and softly said, "Yes." The room
broke into prolonged, booming applause. ONE YEAR LATER, on September 18,
1988, we were married. The house

liked this and permitted us to hold the ceremony within, with Mandy and

Dennis walking down her green marble staircase and the vows spoken and
clearly heard in her living room. The house tolerated my stuffing
insulation into her walls, but she positively adored Mandy's coddling
with drapes and cushions and throw pillows. She especially liked being
painted black and white, like the authentic Cotswold Tudor she aspired
to be. We all adjourned to Le Bec Fin for dinner. It was a Sunday, and
Georges Perrier had given over his whole establishment to the wedding
party. He served us his lighter-than-air mousse of pike in a pale-pink
lobster sauce, filet mignon in a marrow-enriched sauce bordelaise, and
turbot with white butter. Dick Graff had sent his prized Chalone
chardonnay, and we also served the deeply golden "selected late harvest"
from Phelps 1976 as well as the Phelps 1979, which was dark brown with
over-the-top residual sugar. For the wedding cake, Georges constructed a
croquembouche, a skyscraper of custard-filled puff pastry balls threaded
with caramel, which Mandy and I launched by cracking it open with a
bottle of champagne. The speeches were not perfunctory. Judy Rodin (then
dean at Yale and president of Penn six years later), who advised Mandy
on her thinideal paper, toasted us as "a perfect Penn couple." George
Vaillant wished us joy and children and a positive future. With tears in
her eyes, Irene silently raised her glass to us all. Dennis spoke about
Mandy's courage in leaving England and setting out (just as he had) for
a land unknown, knowing not a soul. WE HONEYMOONED AT an inn down the
road in Wayne for one night, and

then a few weeks later we rented a house on the fourteenth hole of the
Kanapali golf course in Maui for a month. I birdied the hole once and
double-bogeyed it about fifty times. We returned to Woodleigh in time
for the cold weather and were welcomed by roaring fires in the living
room fireplace for the duration of the winter. "Are you happy?" Mandy
asked innocently, as we basked in the glow of the firelight one snowy
evening. My irritated peroration took her aback. "What a stupid
question!" I snapped, then, adopting my interrupt-atyour-own-risk
professorial mode, continued, "Happy? Now there's an empty concept.
Ambrose Bierce called it the mythical state attributed by adults to
children, by children to adults, and by the living to the dead.

'Happy' is a word used by so many people, so many ideologies, as to be
rendered utterly senseless. It's just not a viable notion. You can't do
science on it, and much worse you can't run your life around it.
Psychology has been better off since Freud, and Schopenhauer before him
told us to forget all about being happy. The best we can ever do in life
is to not be miserable, to hold our suffering to as near zero as
possible. Now that's a successful life." Mandy gazed patiently at me.
Her serene face showed confidence, and she said just one word: "Wrong."
AS A FORTY-SIX-YEAR-OLD married man, I decided to change my days.

Rather than go into the office in the psychology department every day as
I'd done for the last fifteen years, I decided to spend more of my time
with Mandy. Some of my work required face-to-face contact: teaching
students and politicking in the never-ending, disheartening department
battle between natural and social science. But much of what I did---
writing, reading, directing research projects, conversing with
colleagues around the world, and thinking---I could do remotely. I now
had a home and wanted to luxuriate therein. Mandy had asked me if I was
happy and I had snapped at her, irritated by the question itself. But I
did notice a change: I thought more about positive possibilities in my
life now. Until Mandy, I fit the FreudSchopenhauer ideal perfectly:
almost all my emotional thinking was about minimizing my own
misery---how to placate an angry colleague, how to galvanize an
underproducing student, how to tone my flabby body, or how to be less
depressed myself. It occurred to me that the best I could ever do---even
if I completely solved all these problems---was arrive at zero. But now
I found myself thinking about what might be north of zero in my life:
spending more time with Mandy, creating a rose garden in the backyard,
listening to the Berlin Philharmonic and Meatloaf more, and playing
serious bridge more. I didn't know what, if anything, "happy" meant, but
I could distinguish spending my life correcting what was wrong from
spending it building what was right. Building a good life as opposed to
correcting my shortcomings captured "happier" rather than just "less
unhappy." MANDY FINISHED HER third-year studies and wrote her two "major
area"

papers. One was the thin-ideal article positing that an unachievable
thin

ideal for women caused eating disorders. The other discussed
"attachment,"2 an alien concept for me. "Attachment" came from animal
ethology: goslings that "imprint" on their mother (or the first moving
goose-like thing they see) "attach." The early ethologists---Konrad
Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen---were both behaviorists at heart, and
"attachment" was their work-around term for the less scientific,
subjective state of "love." "Attachment" then found its way into the
psychoanalytic camp to describe the strength of the mother-child bond.
The strength of child-mother attachment explains later depression and
anxiety and other patterns of neurotic behavior as the child grows up.
"Insecurely attached" children, in perpetual fear of abandonment by
their unreliable mothers, go on to adult neuroses and become failures in
life. They worry that any new love object will abandon them, just as
their mother did. "Securely attached" children are confident about their
mothers' love---she is reliable and will always love them---and go on to
believe in themselves and trust others. This leads to healthy
relationships and successful lives. Mandy took this theory very
seriously as a life lesson, and when we had our first child, Lara, Mandy
made a crucial decision: she would also stay home, with Lara and with
me, rather than do a doctoral dissertation. The New York Times phoned
and interviewed her. She told the reporter, "I decided not to leave my
child to go study attachment." WE TOOK A second honeymoon, this time to
what would become our

regular and most cherished vacation spot: Kona Village on the west coast
of the Big Island, Hawaii. No television, no radio, just a comfortable
hale (a South Sea island cottage, pronounced "hahLAY"), Kona coffee, and
big families, a few steps from a magnificent coral reef. Lara was just
seven months old, and in our hale built over a black lava outcropping,
she took her first step and said her first word. I arranged for
childcare for Lara so that Mandy and I could have romantic dinners and
long walks and cuddly snorkels together---just the two of us. Mandy
tearfully declined and paid the babysitter to go away. "I want to be
together with you and Lara. I don't want her raised by a stranger,"
Mandy explained. Mandy's fireside question, "Are you happy?" and now her
decision to restructure our lives around a secure nest both nagged at
me. Was she onto a huge missing piece in my work?

This nagging worry had popped up in other, less intimate venues, and I
sensed convergence. MELISSA HUNT, a clinical PhD student of mine, did
her first-year research

on happiness---not on my students' usual topic of depression. I
confessed little enthusiasm for happiness as a research topic, and
Melissa asked me why. I reminded her of Phil Brickman's now classic
study of twenty-two lottery winners.3 At first their happiness went up,
but after a few months it sank back down to its usual curmudgeonly
level. "Happiness is the just froth on the cappuccino. I want to study
the espresso underneath. Depression, anxiety, and anger: that's the
espresso," I told Melissa. She was unconvinced. I HAD BEEN treating
patients off and on for more than fifteen years. The

unspoken premise was that therapy had succeeded when you helped patients
rid themselves of all their sadness, all their anxiety, and all their
anger. This followed from Freud's axiom that the best we can ever hope
for in life is not to suffer, to confine our misery to as close to zero
as possible. While not much of a therapist, I sometimes did good work,
and in those cases, my patients' negative emotions were normal by
termination. Did I get a happy patient? No, I got an empty patient. The
convergence was that happiness is more than the absence of unhappiness.
There was more to research, more to therapy, and more to theory than
just misery and its relief. Most poignantly, there was more to life---my
life in particular.

Chapter Seventeen

Learned Optimism (1989--1993)

I FOUND MYSELF IN Richard Pine's office. Richard was a thirty-year-old
Penn graduate and, even at this tender age, a prominent Manhattan
literary agent. He was lithe, already balding, and intensely curious
about how science can inform the human spirit. He had already sold
blockbuster fiction bestsellers and was now looking for science-based
nonfiction that might guide readers to fuller lives. Dan Oran, a
novelist, my friend, and the manager of our booming Metropolitan Life
testing business, had wangled this meeting and told me that people
"kill" to get in front of Richard. Richard had read some of my articles,
and so we discussed learned helplessness at length. I had never talked
with an "agent" before and was surprised by the depth of his knowledge
of psychology. He liked the breadth of topics that helplessness bears
on--- physical health, sports, longevity, business success---but was
uneasy about the negative tone underlying all my work: pessimism,
depression, helplessness, and anxiety. "You have a book in you, Marty,"
Richard said, "a book on optimism." "But I don't work on optimism," I
countered reflexively, as I began my leave-taking. "I work on
pessimism." But I couldn't help thinking about the rats, the dogs, and
the people who never gave into helplessness. I couldn't help thinking of
the rats that had received escapable shock and then fought off tumors
even better than rats that had no shock at all. I couldn't help thinking
of the swimmers who swam faster after a defeat. I couldn't help thinking
of all the people who, after trauma, grew stronger and wiser rather than
deteriorating, of all the people who overcame their dismal, impoverished
childhoods and rose to success, even to greatness. I couldn't help
thinking that my patients

needed more skills than just those to fight depression or anxiety. I
couldn't help ruing my brusque answer to Mandy's "Are you happy?" and
remembering how much comfort I found in Mandy's nest-building.

Richard Pine was intensely curious about how science could inform the
human spirit. He had already sold blockbuster fiction bestsellers, and
he was now looking for science-based nonfiction that might guide readers
to fuller lives. He became my advisor and literary agent. Photo courtesy

"People make religions of this stuff. I pray you will write a book on
optimism," Richard murmured as I left. On this day I discovered what
"agent" meant, and Richard became my agent, trusted advisor, and good
friend. Richard's challenge reawakened the puzzle of why the negative
exerts such a hammerlock on the mind. Why did I believe that my work was
about pessimism and not optimism, about fear and not courage, about
failure and not success, about sadness and not happiness? Of course the
proximate cause was that the agenda of the National Institute of Mental
Health was mental illness, and it funded my work. But the power behind
the death grip of negativity went much deeper than mere funding. What is
so attractive about original sin---the dogma that deep down we are
fallen, that we are rotten to the core? What is so attractive about the
theory that people are basically mean and self-seeking? What is so

attractive about virtue, sacrifice, and generosity as mere self-serving
illusions, frail defenses that compensate for the reality of underlying
vice? What is so attractive about Freud's dictum that the best we can
ever hope for in life is not to be miserable? Why is journalism governed
by "If it bleeds, it leads"? Why are our politics about exposing the
ignobility of the candidates and voting for the "least bad" one? Why
does victimology almost have a monopoly on government funding with the
pursuit of happiness left to the individual? The literature is
unanimous: bad is stronger than good. A severe toothache overrides an
enjoyable conversation. A crying baby in the next room preempts
lovemaking. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. In the laboratory you solve
nine of the ten problems correctly, but you will remember the one you
got wrong. Why? For one thing, we are bad-weather animals. The most
recent geological epoch that shaped human evolution was the Pleistocene,
the ice ages: famine, ice, flood, drought, and more ice. What kind of
primate survived the ice ages? What happened to the brain that believed
"It is a nice day today; I'm sure it will be a nice day tomorrow"? This
brain was crushed by tomorrow's ice. The brain that believed "Today may
seem like a nice day, but tomorrow comes the trouble" survived and
passed its genes down to us. Paranoia---to say nothing of depression,
anxiety, and anger---has major survival advantages in a world that is
actually full of danger, loss, and injustice. The human mind is like the
human tongue. The tongue's default mode is to swish around the mouth
until it finds a cavity and then to worry the defective tooth. The
tongue does not look for a perfect tooth and then savor its
flawlessness. The tongue is there not to celebrate what is right but to
detect what is wrong and hidden. The default mode of your mind is to
swish around your life until it discovers a problem that just might
explode into real trouble. It then hones in and plans how to avoid it.
The mind did not evolve to celebrate life. The death grip of the
negative exists not just because we are badweather animals but also
because the negative has an urgency that the positive rarely does.
Danger, loss, and trespass tend to arrive suddenly and insist on
immediate attention. A stimulating idea, a romantic evening, or a great
performance of Mahler's "Resurrection" symphony does not have the
shrillness of a fire alarm.

While sadness, fear, and anger surely have evolutionary benefits, they
come at a very steep price. If in reality it will be a nice day
tomorrow, then the mentality that anxiously broods over the possibility
of bad weather cannot bask in the good. If in reality loss is not
imminent, then a perpetually gloomy mentality is self-defeating. If in
reality other people can be trusted, then the paranoid mentality is
self-destructive. If our world is no longer an ice age, our inherited
bad-weather mentality ruins many more lives than it saves. The upshot is
that the pessimistic mind-set needs no advocates and no teaching. People
do not need to have the fact that the world is full of loss, danger, and
trespass drummed into them. Contrary to cocktail party chatter, there is
nothing wise or sophisticated about pessimism. It is the human
default---and as we shall see in Chapter 28, it is likely the mammalian
default. Pessimism is lazy; it comes easily and naturally. If you
actually live in a more benign world than the Pleistocene and want to
enjoy your species' hard-earned prosperity, you have to break out of the
negative. What needs teaching---what needs nurturance, support, and
justification---is an optimistic view of the world. Richard Pine was
right: the world needed a book on optimism, and so I began to write one.
Richard sold the book to Sonny Mehta at Alfred A. Knopf, on the basis of
little more than an outline and a long writing sample, for what seemed
to me a staggering sum. Knopf under Sonny's stewardship was the toniest
of publishers, and since I was new to big-league publishing, we hired
Tom Congdon (who, Tom told me, ghosted the bestseller Jaws) as my
just-in-case ghost. I sent Tom a sample chapter, and he commented
extensively. I sent him an even more extensively redone chapter, and he
generously told me, "You've got it." So ended the ghosting. Because I
have already told you about the research on optimism and its relation to
depression, sports, schoolwork, Met Life, and physical health, there is
no need to repeat it here. The book, titled Learned Optimism, gave me
the freedom to integrate the basic research on learned helplessness and
explanatory style with those realms of life. It also contained two other
elements: First, I presented the questionnaires we developed for adults
and children and encouraged the readers to take the tests, score them,
and gain insight into their own levels of pessimism and depression.
Second, I presented evidence-based exercises for adults and kids to do
that reliably raised optimism and decreased depression. Disputing
pessimistic thoughts is the central skill of learned

optimism. A mother finds herself shouting at her children every morning
when she sends them off to school. She thinks, "I'm a terrible mother,"
a permanent, pervasive, and personal explanation that puts her at risk
for depression. She learns to dispute this thought realistically. When
the kids come home from school, she remembers that she is cheerful,
helps them with their homework, and listens patiently to their social
problems. She now substitutes "I'm not a morning person" to explain her
grouchiness. This explanation, while personal, is temporary and
specific, and so it does not produce depression. Essentially learned
optimism takes the techniques of cognitive therapy---which are used with
very depressed people---and applies them to everyone. The book walked
readers stepby-step toward using these skills for themselves and their
children. One major caution ended the book: the need for a sober balance
of optimism and pessimism. I did not wish to advocate optimism,
recommending its use to counter every trouble. The final chapter
discussed "flexible" optimism, a way of thinking that gave pessimism its
due. Pessimism has evolution behind it and seems to be the default
response to troubles. In a reality full of danger, loss, and trespass,
pessimism is a virtue. Having learned the skills of optimism by
disputing catastrophic thoughts, how---in any given situation---do you
decide whether to deploy optimism? Ask yourself, "How dire are the
consequences of failure here?" If the consequences are small, use
optimism. So, for example, you see an attractive woman at a conference.
Should you introduce yourself and try to make friends? Failure here is
merely one more rejection in a life full of them. So dispute the thought
"Women never like me." When, however, the consequences are major---if
your wife finds out, she will divorce you---refrain from learned
optimism. We do not want optimistic pilots who might ask, why bother
de-icing the plane a second time? The weather is likely going to be
fine? The consequence of failure here is catastrophe. Learned Optimism
was duly published in 1990,1 and I went on my first book tour: The Today
Show, where Joe Garagiola asked me if the opposite of optimism,
helplessness, had ever occurred to me; Good Morning, Phoenix, where at 5
a.m. I discovered I was on a spiritualist wake-up show. I called my
tough-minded editor, Jon Siegel, who told me that the book was number
one in Newsday and commented enigmatically, "If you have to have a
number, that's a good one." It got a

highly positive review in the influential Sunday New York Times. The
reviewer confessed to being a pessimist and said Learned Optimism had
"vaulted her out of her funk."2 This review transformed the book in the
eyes of the sales rankers from "nonfiction" to "self-help." For an
academic like me, who identifies himself as a scientist, "self-help" was
a dreaded category that I would never shake, but it was a boon for
bookstores since self-help outsells nonfiction. I steeled myself as I
walked into College Hall a few days after the Times review appeared. I
was chair of the Arts and Science Personnel Committee. Our job was to
review tenure cases, and the committee consisted of crusty traditional
academics. I feared the averted eyes and mutterings that awaited me
there, but the room broke into applause. This was a surprise and caused
some rethinking. The professors in the humanities led the applause. For
them, I discovered, a book, particularly one that emanated from a major
New York publisher and then got reviewed in the Times, was the acme of
success. In the sciences, a lead article in a specialized journal was
the acme of success. My reappraisal was confirmed when no psychologist
at Penn said a word to me---not then, not ever---even though the
department broke out champagne when my colleague Henry Gleitman
published his introductory textbook. My first impulse was to try to
shuck off the label "self-help." Selfimprovement, as an explicit genre,
began in the nineteenth century and rapidly grew in popularity. In the
twentieth century, Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence
People and Norman Vincent Peale's The Power of Positive Thinking were
huge, long-lived bestsellers. Their popularity with the public was
matched only by the scorn they elicited in academia. Like most scornful
highbrows, I had never read a "self-help" book, not even Benjamin
Franklin's Autobiography, but now that I was labeled a self-help writer,
I read How to Win Friends and Influence People. It was astonishingly
good. It really did give the reader ways to make friends, with tips
about making other people feel valued (e.g., the most important word in
the English language is one's own name). But it was only armchair advice
lacking any scientific backing. Popularity and success, not earned the
hard way, brought scorn from professors who did careful science but
whose words forked no lightning. But I was writing "self-help" and
indeed chose my work explicitly to allow people to help themselves. But
with one new addition: the tests and exercises came from the very
vineyards of science---thousands of

subjects, control groups, careful measurement, and peer review. I wrote
not footless self-help but evidence-based self-help, and I believe
Learned Optimism may have been the first of this genre. The 1991 Gulf
War broke out in Kuwait, and American shopping malls emptied. Even with
few shoppers, the book made the lower ranks of the New York Times
best-seller list for a few weeks, and that was the high-water mark of
its popularity. But to my satisfaction it sold steadily and well for the
next twenty-five years. I also wrote The Optimistic Child with Karen
Reivich, Jane Gillham, and Lisa Jaycox.3 This book recreated for
schoolchildren the tests and exercises we had developed for adults. The
four of us completed a major program for teaching optimism in middle
school and found that arming ten- and eleven-year-olds with the skills
of optimism markedly lowered their risk for depression and anxiety when
they went through puberty. This program became the scientific basis for
the field of positive education, which arose fifteen years later and I
will discuss in Chapter 23. The book tour took me to Reverend Pat
Robertson's The 700 Club. Pat was very hospitable to me, and we appeared
together on his call-in show. I was flogging a book about making kids
more optimistic, and he had just written a book on the apocalypse---an
odd pairing of topics. One caller surprised Pat with her concern: "I
need your help, Brother Pat," she said in a deep southern drawl. "I am
thinking about getting pregnant, but I understand that nursing mothers
don't do very well during an apocalypse." The grueling book tours
notwithstanding, this medium was within my tessitura, and I went to work
on my next Knopf book, What You Can Change and What You Can't.4 The idea
combined my work on preparedness (some things are learned much more
easily than others and some things cannot be learned at all) with all
the hard work Dave Rosenhan and I did in writing Abnormal Psychology. In
the course of our reviewing every psychotherapy and every major drug for
every kind of disorder, it dawned on me that some problems are easily
treated, and others are untreatable. Yet the public remained in the dark
not only about optimal treatments but, worse, about the disorders for
which therapy and drugs are a huge waste of time, money, and emotional
energy. So I set out to write a sort of Guide Michelin to the major
disorders and all the major treatments. Given the amount and quality of
the evidence, I

awarded zero to four stars for each major treatment for each major
disorder. So, for example, panic attack, characterized by heart
pounding, suffocation, flop sweat, and the feeling that one is about to
die, had quite a large number of controlled outcome studies. Untreated
it typically was chronic. Antidepressant and antianxiety drugs got three
stars for improvement, but the high relapse rate earned them only one
and a half stars overall. Cognitive therapy, in contrast, got four stars
for both improvement and relapse. For unipolar depression, interpersonal
therapy, cognitive therapy, and antidepressant drugs all got three stars
on improvement, and electroconvulsive shock (ECT) got three and a half
stars. But they differed on side effects and relapse, with ECT and drugs
getting only one and a half stars overall and the psychotherapies
earning two and a half stars overall. I have continued to follow the
outcome literature in the twenty years since publication, and,
dismayingly, there has been almost no progress. This book did not become
a New York Times bestseller, but it changed my life more than anything
else I ever wrote. "CONSUMER REPORTS RATES automobiles and dishwashers,
as you know,

Dr. Seligman, but we now want to wade into murkier waters and rate
psychotherapy. Will you help us do it?" The voice on the phone belonged
to an editor of this highly credible and commercially disinterested
publication. I revered it and turned to it whenever making a big
purchase. I was delighted to agree. The evaluation of psychotherapy was
indeed murky. There was almost violent disagreement among outcome
researchers and between the warring camps of psychotherapy about how to
do it. Early-outcome research looked at patients' satisfaction with
therapy. Here the kind of psychotherapy did not seem to matter much, and
quite high satisfaction was generally reported. But the numbers were
small, and as the importance of insurance and reimbursement grew, there
was a call for harder outcomes than mere satisfaction: relief of
specific symptoms and cure of the disorder. These harder studies
constituted the meat and potatoes of What You Can Change and What You
Can't, in which specific therapies for specific disorders won. Exposure
therapy, for example, relieves obsessive-compulsive disorders well, but
nonspecific supportive therapy does not. Behavior therapy does well for
curing phobias, but psychoanalysis does not.

Actual clinicians in the field all but ignored these outcome data. Most
therapists in the early 1990s were eclectic and psychoanalytically
inclined---but not dogmatically so---and dispensed support and
acceptance freely. Only a minority used specific techniques for specific
problems, such as progressive relaxation for phobias, which my book
endorsed. Moreover, many clinicians found DSM diagnosis and the very
notion of specific disorders alien. A real patient rarely fit into one
diagnostic niche perfectly, and his problems were usually multiple
("comorbid"); for example, anxiety almost always accompanies depression.
The goal of many clinicians was not to relieve the symptoms of a
specific disorder but to improve the well-being, emotional lives, and
functioning of their patients more globally. The field of outcome
studies was monopolized by "efficacy" studies, which randomized
volunteers into one of two groups: a specific short-term treatment or a
plausible but inert control treatment. The big insurance companies
("managed care") followed the efficacy studies for treatment
reimbursement and would not pay up if the therapist did not diagnose a
specific disorder and then treat it with the specific "efficacious"
therapy for the allotted number of sessions. So while efficacy studies
fit the needs of short-term reimbursable therapy, the whole notion of
the efficacy study was anathema to the long-term therapist whose goal
was global mental health. I cannot overstate the passion that fired this
quarrel. Entire livelihoods, as well as the mental health of the nation,
depended on this issue, which ripped the 160,000-member American
Psychological Association (APA) itself in two. William James's APA had
been an organization of paper-reading scientists, but therapists began
to join in force after World War II. By the 1970s the therapists had
become the majority, and the scientists were in retreat. In the early
1980s the therapists, led by the "dirty dozen," organized a revolt and
successfully overthrew the scientists' monopoly on APA governance. Many
scientists abruptly quit the association in revulsion and joined the
breakaway American Psychological Society. The pivotal issue was now
efficacy studies, with most scientists saying yes and most therapists
shouting no. Almost every APA president since 1980 had come from the
militant therapy side of the aisle. Consumer Reports (CR) wanted to do
the largest and most representative study of psychotherapy ever
conducted. Its editors had

read my book and turned to me because I seemed a disinterested
scientific observer. But CR did not intend to do an efficacy study.
There would be no clinic volunteers, no placebo control group, no random
assignment of patients to treatment, no standard diagnostic workup, and
no fixed duration of treatment. Rather CR would do an "effectiveness"
study, looking at the outcome of therapy as it is done in the real
world. In its annual 1994 survey, CR sent out to its 180,000 subscribers
around one hundred questions about automobiles and mental illness. The
survey asked, At any time over the past three years, have you
experienced stress or other emotional problems for which you sought help
from any of the following: friends, relatives, or a member of the
clergy, a mental health professional like a psychologist or a
psychiatrist, your family doctor, or a support group? Of the 18,000
subscribers who responded, 7,000 admitted to such problems; of these,
4,100 had gone to a mental health professional. Led by Mark Kotkin, CR's
analysts created a composite outcome measure: 1. Specific improvement
("How much did treatment help with the specific problem that led you to
therapy?") 2. Satisfaction ("Overall how satisfied were you with this
therapist's treatment of your problems?") 3. Global improvement
("overall emotional state" at the time of the survey compared with the
start of treatment: "very poor: I barely managed to deal with things;
fairly poor: Life was usually pretty tough for me; so-so: I had my ups
and downs; quite good: I had no serious complaints; very good: Life was
much the way I liked it to be") The findings were unexpected, dramatic,
and far-reaching, and they catapulted me smack into the middle of the
war between therapists and scientists. The first finding was that
treatment by a mental health professional usually worked, and most
patients got a lot better. Of the 426 people who

were feeling very poor when they began therapy, 87 percent were feeling
very good, good, or at least so-so by the time of the survey. Of the 786
people who were feeling fairly poor at the outset, 92 percent were
feeling very good, good, or at least so-so by the time of the survey.
This surprised me: the efficacy studies taken as a whole---many hundreds
of them---showed much more modest results. In my best overall estimate,
they showed that only about 65 percent of patients got better with
either drugs or therapy against an alarming 40 percent placebo rate.
Second, long-term therapy worked much better than short-term therapy.
This was a big surprise. Long-term therapy was the favorite whipping boy
of the science wing of which I was a card-carrying member. Taking years
and being very expensive, long-term therapy was thought of as little
better than a fraud, a Freudian dinosaur long overdue for extinction.
That it should be effective at all, to say nothing of more effective
than all the short-term therapies, was a gut shot to efficacy research.
Third, psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers did equally
well, and all did better than marriage counselors; family doctors did as
well as the other professionals in the short run but worse in the long
run. This was another surprise. Therapy of the general supportive and
eclectic type dispensed by the average therapist was usually thought of
as mere placebo. Academics saw it as another Freudian dinosaur, but the
fact that marriage counselors and family doctors did worse suggested
that supportive therapy did contain active helpful ingredients. Fourth,
no specific form of therapy did any better than any other. This was the
biggest surprise. The entire theme of the efficacy studies and of What
You Can Change and What You Can't was that specific therapies work
better on specific disorders: systematic desensitization on phobia,
cognitive therapy on depression, exposure on obsessivecompulsive
disorder. Was I wrong? Finally, if insurance coverage limited the choice
of therapist or duration of therapy, patients did worse. This was cause
for upheaval. Managed care had become almost universal in America on the
grounds that limiting the duration of therapy and forcing the patient
into the right treatment and to the right therapist would save money and
improve Americans' mental health. But these results suggested that it
was systematically undermining the mental health of the country.

THE CONSUMER REPORTS article unleashed some praise and a torrent of

criticism. The praise came from the therapists in the trenches: finally
a respected academic had documented and published the fact they were
actually doing good work. The torrent of criticism came from my brothers
and sisters in the academy, particularly those who devoted their careers
to testing the efficacy of specific therapies for specific disorders.
Lee Sechrest, one of the most senior advocates of rigorous science about
therapy, told an audience that my participation in the CR survey was
"unforgiveable" and that I was a "traitor." The heart of their criticism
was that efficacy studies were the gold standard for verifying what
therapy worked and that the Consumer Reports survey was trash. Efficacy
studies entailed random assignment of patients to therapy or placebo.
All were done with a single diagnosis, a manual, and a fixed duration.
This meant that they could be replicated in the laboratory. The CR
survey, on the other hand, being naturalistic, allowed patients to
choose (heaven forbid) what therapy they got, what therapist they had,
and how long they stayed in treatment, and it allowed the therapist to
change tack if an approach was not working. Completely uncontrolled
trash. And so, under the gun, I came to grips once again with the
problem of external validity: the very issue that had shaken me out of
the animal laboratory and into the messier world of real people in their
real worlds. This time the issue was not merely academic; the
livelihoods of thousands of therapists and, if taken seriously, the very
mental health of the nation were at stake. Even though it looked like
good science, the efficacy method---when examined closely---had huge
methodological problems that the effectiveness method, used in the CR
survey, did not. Let's take the problems one at a time. The point of
randomly assigning patients to therapy or a placebo is to spread the
unseen and unknown, the confounding characteristics of the sample,
evenly across therapy and placebo. So, for example, if all the patients
in the placebo group happened to be introverts or to be very angry or to
have rejecting mothers, therapy would do better than placebo, but not
because the treatment worked. Random assignment is supposed to even out
these confounding characteristics. But a close look shows that it
doesn't. Typically in an efficacy study, about twenty patients go into
each group. But imagine conservatively that ten personal traits

might influence outcomes. If you do the math, random assignment requires
hundreds of patients---an unheard-of number---to actually even things
out. Random assignment, done with just a few dozen patients, is mere
window dressing. Even worse, an efficacy study forces (randomly
"assigns") you into one type of therapy even if you do not want it and
do not believe it will work. In the real world you usually choose a
therapy and a therapist you believe in. You control what kind of therapy
you have. What if success in therapy depends partly on your beliefs and
your wholehearted buy-in? Many disorders involve hopelessness, and to
the extent that choosing a therapy and a therapist undercuts
hopelessness, therapy will work better. So efficacy methods negate the
benefits of choice, while effectiveness methods estimate the power of
choice accurately. In real therapy, duration depends on the progress of
the patient. In real therapy, the therapist does not follow a manual and
can change tack if progress is slow or poor. In real therapy the patient
has many problems, not typically a single diagnosable one. And who
volunteers for an efficacy study when it is advertised that half of the
volunteers will get a placebo? Not your typical patient. So efficacy
studies systematically underestimate the usefulness of therapy for real
patients in the real world. I concluded that effectiveness studies, of
which the CR study was the largest to date, are a decent guide to what
works, and efficacy studies are not.5 In a stroke I became a pariah to
many of my academic colleagues, but I became very popular with
therapists. THE YEAR ENDED tragically for me. Shortly after my election
as APA

president, I got a call from the sheriff of West Palm Beach, Florida. My
mother, he told me, was in the hospital with a broken hip. But that was
not all: she had facial contusions and other bruises. Irene's
housekeeper, a middle-aged Romanian immigrant, had been arrested on
suspicion of physically abusing her. I flew down to the hospital. When I
asked Irene if she'd been beaten, she denied it. I took her back with me
to recover in a plush nursing home near our house. Once there Irene
confessed the abuse to Mandy and that she had not wanted to tell me lest
I worry about her or, even worse, the housekeeper hurt her even more on
discovering her tattling.

We celebrated Irene's ninetieth birthday with all her siblings, and she
even gave a little speech, saying I had been a "wonderful son." But she
went downhill soon thereafter and soon stopped eating altogether. "Matzo
ball soup?" I asked her. She perked up and repeated, "Matzo ball soup!"
her first words in days. She smiled and for the next week drank Matzo
ball soup through a straw. She died on February 26, 1996. Irene's
housekeeper was convicted of abuse, even though a charge of murder or
manslaughter might have been warranted, and she received a year's
probation with the warning not to apply for work as a caretaker in the
future. In the tumult around Irene's abuse and death, my own emotional
life seemed peculiar to me. I could not bring myself to look on her
lifeless body, and my aversion had the same defensive quality as when I
avoided visiting my paralyzed father in the nursing home forty years
before. Nor could I bring myself to pursue charges against her
housekeeper, and I declined to appear at her trial. I just wanted to
forget. My emotions were blunted, and not until I threw the first earth
on Irene's casket as it was lowered did I wrap my cousin, Bobbi, in my
arms and finally weep uncontrollably. Twenty years removed from Irene's
death, my memory of her remains distorted. Irene was almost invariably
loving and positive. She lived by the doctrine "If you can't say
anything nice, don't say anything at all," but in her last years she
could be crabby. She once criticized us for wasting money on a bouquet
of flowers for her. I find it difficult to conjure up happy, earlier
memories of her and treacherously easy to remember the isolated,
negative instances from her last, troubled years. I wish I understood
this better, since we all want our children to remember us at our best
and certainly not at our worst.

Chapter Eighteen

APA (1995--1999)

I HADN'T BEEN PRESIDENT of anything since the ninth grade, and no one
had since asked me to run for anything. It was hard not to notice that
my friends were assuming high office: Judy Rodin, for example, was
elected president of the Eastern Psychological Association. But I had no
knowledge about how this was done. Didn't scientific honors and national
office just come based on some organic acclamation for work
accomplished? "Sandy," I asked in a moment of naive and abashed candor,
"why am I never invited onto prestigious national committees?" My
friend, Sandra Scarr, was an all-around professional success, and I
envied her. She was chair of the psychology department at the University
of Virginia and a prominent researcher on race, poverty, and IQ. She was
also politically astute, having evaded the wrath that usually rained
down on researchers who found a genetic component to IQ. She was,
moreover, the president of the breakaway American Psychological Society.
"These are not knighthoods, Marty. You probably think it is beneath
dignity, but scientific honors and national office are not bestowed
because you happen to do good science. The dirty little secret is that
you have to campaign for them. You have to make allies, and then tell
them you want it," Sandy confided. (I am now informed that this is also
true of knighthoods.) So I decided to run for office. I, quietly and
blushing all the while, told a few of my friends that I wanted to be
president of the Division of Clinical Psychology, Division 12, the
largest unit of the American Psychological Association. On my first try,
David Barlow, the leading anxiety-therapy researcher, won by a bit, but
on my second try in 1993, I was elected easily.

Being president was fun. I liked the people---other clinical researchers
for the most part. I liked the venue---three meetings a year in
Washington, DC. And I liked the work---moving the agenda, foisted upon
me at Penn, of building good clinical science onto the national stage,
where the petty politics of departmental infighting was not so personal.
My main issue was building support for evidence-based therapy, and with
Dave Barlow we oversaw the publication of an influential book on this
topic.1 Standing up for evidence-based therapy was dandy as far as the
academic-based governing board of Division 12 was concerned. But as I
began to meet the therapists forced to labor under the insurance
companies' reimbursement guidelines derived from efficacy research, I
learned that this evidence was not welcome in the trenches. Therapists
told me that it provided fodder for the managed care machine that boxed
them into overly simple diagnoses, stripped-down brief treatment, lower
wages, invasion of patients' privacy, and, worst, termination of therapy
too early, without the relief that longer therapy would produce. These
therapists welcomed the Consumer Reports study. My newfound popularity
with therapists---who formed the largest voting bloc in the American
Psychological Association---outweighed my sudden unpopularity with my
academic peers. "I could be elected president of APA," I told Mandy once
I saw the CR dataset. "Go for it," she said. "My one condition is that
we buy a truck, and everywhere you go as president, you take me and the
kids." The family now included Lara, seven, Nikki, almost five, and
Darryl, three. "I AM GOING to run for president of APA, and I need
Penn's help," I told Judy Rodin, who was back at the University of
Pennsylvania as president of the whole place. After a lightning ascent
from department chair to dean to provost at Yale, she was not chosen as
Yale's president, and Penn had the good fortune to steal her back. "I
intend to take it seriously, and I would like you to give me a fiveyear
paid leave from Penn. One year to run, 1996, and if elected, three years
to serve, 1997--1999, and one year to recover and retool as a
scientist." "OK," she told me, "I will grant that in exchange for the
copyrights on your Learned Optimism intellectual property. Penn will
license these

out to schools and corporations, and that will cover the cost of your
leave." As I left, Judy said, "In the meantime, keep the seat warm for
me." "I AM THINKING about running for president," I told Janet Matthews,
a member of the APA board of directors. She kept me abreast of the
latest detective page-turners and was well disposed toward me.
"Impossible! The candidates line up years in advance, and the order of
succession is already designated. Dick Suinn from Colorado has been
chosen for next year." "Who chose Dick? Isn't this the only office for
which all members of APA can vote?" I asked naively. "The machine chose
Dick, and it has run APA ever since taking it over from the scientists
fifteen years ago." Janet explained that this machine was a coalition of
the leaders of the state associations, the activist practitioners from
the council of representatives, and, most importantly, the Council for
the Advancement of Private Practice and Sciences (CAPPS). The nominees
were handpicked and had served the practice coalition for a long time.
This had been true every year for the last fifteen, and so only a tiny
fraction of the membership even bothered to vote. "At any rate," she
concluded, "Dick is next, then Stan Moldawsky, the head of CAPPS, then
Ron Levant, the next head of CAPPS." I was appalled. How did sitting on
committees in Washington for a decade and networking with the other
committees qualify a person to lead all of American psychology? I
determined to defy this smug, selfappointed group and win. I would give
myself no excuse for losing. The candidates campaigned, and so did
I---not with buttons ("Win with Suinn") or brochures but with a speech.
The main way to meet the therapists was to attend their state
conventions, so starting in early 1996, I went to those in New York,
California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Michigan, and Georgia. I had one
edge: what my opposition derided as "name recognition," as if
recognition were not earned but somehow a product of Madison Avenue
repetition, like "Alka-Seltzer." So, unlike the other hopefuls, I was
invited to give a standing-room-only keynote presentation in each of
these states. My speech had a theme: that psychotherapy needed better
evidence of its effectiveness, evidence of

the sort Consumer Reports had begun to gather, and that science---as the
ally of practice---could provide it. I got standing ovations. I ventured
into the lion's den. In the mid-1970s, a pugnacious nononsense
psychotherapist named Rogers Wright had led his "dirty dozen," as they
proudly called themselves, into a head-on collision with the science
wing over who would run APA. The practitioners organized, a tactic that
science regarded as undignified and never bothered to do, and Rogers
demanded proportional representation in government. Science was
blindsided, and by 1980 the practitioners had won and science took a
resentful backseat to practice. Rogers was the founding president and
chief organizer of what became CAPPS. Rogers and I met at a deli in
rural California and were both surprised and delighted by what we found.
Rogers found a scientist sympathetic to practice, and I found a street
fighter who wanted to promote independent practice by bolstering it with
good science. Rogers felt that his successors had gone too far in
reflexively fighting rather than exploiting science, and to my shock he
agreed to campaign for me. As our family drove through Yellowstone Park
in late spring of 1996, I went to a pay phone and found out that I had
won the election with almost 10,000 votes, three times as many as my
nearest opponent. Conceding, Dick Suinn, not ungraciously, labeled me a
"force of nature." Yet, of course, the work was only beginning. A few
weeks later I had the lightning bolt conversation with my five-year-old
daughter, Nikki, that opens this book, and I made up my mind to use my
new post to lead the charge for positive psychology. The opposition was
fierce from the start, but like my daughter, I was resolute.

Chapter Nineteen

Inventing Positive Psychology (1998--2001)

"KOOL, KOOL, SUPERKOOL, alles SuperKool." The anthem blasted over and
over out of the loudspeakers at a German-speaking resort in the Yucatan.
It was March 1997, and Mandy had coaxed me into taking a break from my
exhausting and sometimes disheartening work as president-elect of the
American Psychological Association (APA). I didn't want to get out of
bed. Just lying here for the rest of the week seemed like the best way
of living through this cut-rate "vacation." Mandy refused to let me just
lie there. She knew that getting me moving would produce something
better than catatonia. "Let's drive down the road to Yal Ku, near
Akumal," she insisted, pointing to a small blue spot on our tourist map.
So the five of us piled into our rental car and motored into the
enchanted little village of Akumal. Yal Ku, at its north end, was a
"cenote," a lake, mostly underground, formed by the brackish confluence
of the sea and the freshwater rivers. It was surrounded by a few very
large houses, one owned by the Grateful Dead. Darryl, three, climbed up
on my back, and we snorkeled through legions of the fattest, most
colorful and playful reef fish I'd ever seen. (It turns out that the
fish dine on the excrement that the residents of the big houses flush
right into Yal Ku.) We resolved to find an excuse to come someday. That
day was not long in coming. "I'VE RENTED the Grateful Dead house in the
Yucatan, Mike," I told Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi1 on the phone. "Can you
and Isabella cancel your New Year's plans for 1998 and spend the first
week with us, inventing positive psychology?"

I had gotten to know Mike well a year before in late January 1997 at the
now defunct (eradicated by the tsunami that destroyed Fukushima in 2011)
resort of Kona Village, on the Kona-Kailua coast of Hawaii's Big Island.
Mike and Isabella happened to be staying there at the same time as the
five of us, and Mike and I found ourselves walking and snorkeling
together. What I might do as APA president was at the forefront of my
mind, and the possibility of a "positive psychology" of the sort
foreshadowed by my epiphany with Nikki was now more than just
percolating. Mike worked on "flow," that high state of fascination in
which time stops for you, you feel completely at home, and you are at
one with the music. Flow had to be a centerpiece in any conception of
the positive in life. Mike and I talked for hours about what such a
"positive psychology" might entail. I asked him to help me create this
new field, and he agreed. He was enthusiastic about its prospects. "I'VE
RENTED the Grateful Dead house, Ray," I told Ray and Sandy Fowler on the
phone. "Can you spend the first week of the new year with the
Csikszentmihalyis and my family inventing positive psychology?" The nine
of us (Mandy and I and our three kids, Mike and Isabella, and Ray and
Sandy) awakened in our psychedelically painted bedrooms on January 1,
1998, and the adults spent the week spelling out the elements of a new
field and how to found it. The name. "Positive psychology" won out, not
hands down but by default. It sounded too much like the armchair
"positive thinking" of Reverend Norman Vincent Peale for a secular,
science-based endeavor. "Positive" sounded too Americanisch to Mike's
coffeehouse European ear. "Psychology" sounded too narrow for a field
that might eventually supplement the dismal, remedial concerns of all
modern social science. But we couldn't think of a better name. The
substance. We agreed here. The opposite concerns from those of clinical
psychology would anchor this new field---achieving the good life: health
and sanity and those things humans choose to pursue when they are not
suffering or oppressed. The people. We were unanimous here as well.
Young people were the fulcrum. The old scientists and the old
practitioners were sclerotic, overinvested in their way of doing things
and making their livings from studying and treating misery. We had to
attract the brightest not-yettenured scientists to positive psychology,
and they needed to have the

social skills to become the future leaders of the profession. The
funding. Well, this was uncertain. Psychology relied almost exclusively
on the federal government for support. But American politics and federal
ideology were steeped in attending to what is wrong--- disease---and the
good life is not a disease. Hence positive psychology would not be
eligible for tax dollars. We would have to work hard here but could
explore several avenues. First, I would use my whole APA presidential
allotment (\$35,000) to hold a gathering of young people on this very
spot in January 1999, exactly one year hence. Second, Don Clifton, owner
of Gallup, had written to ask if he could back us. Don had written Soar
with Your Strengths2 and told me he'd been waiting his whole life for
APA to get to work on the positive. I contacted him, and we made
concrete plans. Third, the new multi-billion-dollar John Templeton
Foundation would soon hold an event in my honor, and I decided to pitch
positive psychology to Sir John. And then I mentioned a bizarre
encounter I'd had the previous week with a foundation that would not
even tell me its name. "GO SEE HIM, definitely," said Judy Rodin. She
was my president now, and I asked her at a cocktail party if she had
ever heard of a "PT" who sent mysterious emails. I had gotten one
inviting me to come up to Manhattan and chat with him---without
explaining why. So Mari Fitzduff (who was also invited) and I found our
way to a grim lower-Manhattan building with no sign on the door. Mari
was a Northern Ireland peacemaker and constitution writer who worked
with Judy Rodin and me on Judy's commission on civility. We entered a
small, windowless room in which PT and another man sat at a round table,
a speaker phone between them. I now recognized the other person, Joel
Fleishman, an amiable law professor from Duke, who worked quietly with
us on civility. They introduced themselves but the person at the other
end of the speakerphone did not. "We represent an anonymous foundation,"
PT began. "We pick winners and you win. We don't micromanage. But you
must not reveal our identity" (which they had even not told us anyway).
"Now what would you like to do?" PT continued. They funded a gathering
of fifty scholars of genocide. We convened in Derry, Northern Ireland,
because though a genocide had not occurred there, one well might have.
Dan Chirot, valedictorian from my Albany

Academy days, now a distinguished professor of politics and sociology at
the University of Washington, orchestrated the meeting, and we had a
terrific week pinning down conditions that prevent genocide.3 The story
of the anonymous foundation is not over, but before it continues, I must
tell you about another foundation that reached out to me. "CALL THEM UP
and tell them you are not for rent," Mandy insisted. I'd received a
letter on double-thick stationery from John Templeton Jr., president of
the John Templeton Foundation. He proposed that they hold an event in my
honor, a Festschrift. I had never heard of this foundation, but Mandy
did due diligence. She told me that it was rich---but had a religious
agenda. Following Mandy's instructions to the letter, I told the
Templeton executive who answered the phone, "I'm not for rent." "We do
indeed have an agenda," said Arthur Schwartz, as the executive staff
appeared in our living room twenty-four hours later. Arthur was their
spokesman. "Our agenda is to support research at the border of religion
and science." "But I don't work on religion," I said. "I am a scientist,
and I have no axe to grind about theology." "We understand that, Marty,"
said Arthur, making a Venn diagram by circling the thumb and forefinger
of each hand and overlapping the circles. "You are carving out a
positive psychology agenda that includes good character and positive
institutions. Your agenda overlaps with ours in those two spaces. We
want to fund you at the overlap, and we will never try to co-opt you
into our religious agenda." The John Templeton Foundation has been a
major funder of positive psychology for almost two decades, and its
representatives have kept their word. I think of them as the Eagle
Scouts of philanthropy. SIR JOHN MARKS TEMPLETON was on his feet. He was
in his late eighties,

short, balding, and wiry, with an impish smile, and he was leading the
applause. It was February 1998, the end of the second day of the
Festschrift. It had been an exhilarating event. More than twenty of my
colleagues and students delivered speeches: Steve Maier, Chris Peterson,
and Barry Schwartz set the tone by tracing my research path from
helplessness to hope. Lyn Abramson and Lauren Alloy described how

optimism might create invulnerability to depression. Rick Snyder claimed
that hope buffered even profound grief over the death of a loved one.
Rob DeRubeis reminded us that the negative is integral to the positive.
Dave Myers, from the appropriately named Hope College, discussed hope as
the cornerstone of happiness, and I concluded with my vision of a new
positive psychology.4 Sir John took me aside. "I want opinion-makers.
Opinion-makers are the key to progress anywhere, and academia is no
exception. I value hope, optimism, gratitude, loving-kindness, and
forgiveness. My book, The Worldwide Laws of Life,5 is about these
universal values. I want science to take these seriously. I want solid
empirical science on these topics, and there is no such science now. I
want the opinion-makers to create this science. You and I likely differ
about religion, but we share these values." "Science is value-free, Sir
John," I cautioned. "Science will follow the money," Sir John asserted,
beaming confidently. "Now send me a proposal so I can help make positive
psychology a reality." "THAT WAS A great meeting you held in Derry,
Marty." The voice on the car phone was that of the treasurer of the
anonymous foundation. It was a glowing early-autumn afternoon in 1998,
and I was driving with Mandy and the kids through Amish country near
Lancaster, Pennsylvania. My APA presidential convention the month before
had gone swimmingly. I woke up the morning of my speech---it was my
fifty-fifth birthday---at the San Francisco convention to the juddering
of a small earthquake. In my speech, I announced positive psychology as
my central theme and I told the Nikki story. Therapists and researchers
alike greeted my presentation warmly. Even the frosty leaders of the
Council for the Advancement of Private Practice and Sciences seemed
receptive. Jon Kellerman and Dan Goleman gave keynote addresses, and I
swelled with gratitude as I gave a presidential citation to Bob Nozick
for a lifetime of philosophical work that might shape the future of
psychology. Right after the convention, Mandy, Lara, Nikki, Darryl, and
I flew up to Mike Csikszentmihalyi's ranch near the Bitterroot Mountains
in Montana for a week of back and forth about the theory of positive
psychology. Mike and I dissected the psychology of the present, dividing
it into thoughts about the past-present, the present-present, and the
future-present. That

did not achieve immortality but we did grope our way toward defining the
scope of positive psychology as encompassing positive experience,
positive character, and positive institutions.

Sir John Marks Templeton told me, "I want opinion-makers. Opinion-makers
are the key to progress anywhere, and academia is no exception. I value
hope, optimism, gratitude, loving-kindness, and forgiveness.... I want
science to take these seriously. I want solid empirical science on these
topics, and there is no such science now. I want the opinionmakers to
create this science. You and I likely differ about religion, but we
share these values." He became a river to the new field of positive
psychology. Courtesy of the John Templeton Foundation.

"WHAT DO YOU want to do next?" the voice on my car phone asked. I was
taken aback. I had assumed the Derry meeting had ended our work
together. "Next?" I ventured. "Yes," he replied, "what are you thinking
about now?" I explained a bit about a positive psychology, composed of
positive experience, positive character, and positive institutions, but
the line broke up repeatedly, and the conversation ended with him
saying, "Why don't you come up to Manhattan and tell us about it?" This
time there was a sign on the door: Atlantic Philanthropies. Chuck
Feeney, founder of the Duty-Free Shops in every international airport,
had given away his entire fortune, some \$5 billion, to this foundation
to advance opportunity and lasting change for vulnerable people. He had
kept only \$10 million for himself. Again, I walked into a room
containing PT, Joel Fleishman, and a speaker phone, but the room was now
airy, and its huge windows overlooked the East River. "Now, what is this
positive psychology?" Joel asked. I began my pitch, but after about ten
minutes, PT interrupted. "Could you send us two pages about this?" he
asked, and as he ushered me out the door, he added, "And don't forget to
send a budget." One month later a check for \$1.4 million appeared. FOR
NEW YEAR'S DAY 1999 in Akumal, we rented all the houses around

Yal Ku. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Ray Fowler, Don Clifton, and I hosted
six days of conversation among eighteen of the brightest twenty-five to
forty-year-olds who worked in or near the field of positive psychology.
Here is how it came about. In January 1998, right after our meeting in
the Grateful Dead house, Ray, Mike, and I wrote fifty of the leaders of
world social science and asked each for one nominee: "ideal young
person: ages 25--40, assistant to young associate professor at a good
university, well published and with grant money in a field related to
positive psychology; articulate, creative, ambitious, with academic
leadership qualities (future department chairs)." We suggested that the
single best student they had ever had or their current best young
colleague would be perfect. Forty-five nominations, along with much
spontaneous, enthusiastic support for the creation of the field of
positive psychology, came from

the nominators. We selected, from a truly luminescent group, eighteen
people and invited them to attend "a gathering of young, rising
academics... in Mexico to brainstorm about the major intellectual issues
in this field and perhaps to become the nucleus of its future." All
eighteen accepted, and each morning they gave lively presentations in
the palapa. Each afternoon we walked and snorkeled together. Akumal-1
was an unqualified success. A common evaluation was "the best
intellectual experience of my career." All of them said they would
return for Akumal-2 in January 2000. The Akumal eighteen started a
listserv, which is still roaring along eighteen years later. They
generated an annotated eighty-page bibliography of the field as it stood
in 1999 and wrote a long mission statement defining positive psychology
as the scientific study of optimal human functioning with the central
aim of discovering and promoting the factors that cause individuals and
communities to thrive. "I HAVE A condo on Grand Cayman," Don Clifton
told me on the phone. "Please take it for a week and invite the best
people in the world to steer positive psychology. Also ask them to plan
for an inaugural summit--- guest speakers from around the world---in my
hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska. This will be the public kickoff for the
new field. I'll host it, and Gallup will pay for it." In the huge hot
tub outside Don's condo, the cast of characters soaked. Don Clifton and
I had the least head hair. Unlike Don, I spoke often. Next to Don (I do
not have a photo and I am painting this through the fog of memory) was
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, founding director of Penn's Annenberg Public
Policy Center. Her issue at the moment was increasing civility. The US
Congress, in her opinion, was shattering and had lost the capacity to
pass constructive legislation; the two sides of the aisle were no longer
civil to each other, and downright hate and cycles of revenge were the
order of the day. She hoped that positive psychology might come to the
rescue. Dan Robinson sat next to Kathleen. A hybrid
philosopherpsychologist from Georgetown, he would not be driven off the
bedrock of Aristotle. Anything that positive psychology did that could
not be found in Aristotle was suspect. George Vaillant was on Dan's
right. George's view of defenses was

changing before our eyes. In his classic work on the Harvard men, he
consistently found that those who coped with problems using humor,
altruism, anticipation, suppression, and acceptance did best in life. He
called these "mature defenses," but as the meeting went on, he began to
call them "strengths of character," and these traits lost the tinge of
coping against the negative forces of the psyche and transmogrified into
good character. Ed Diener, well over six feet and in fine physical
shape, was new to my personal acquaintance. Unlike any of the rest of
us, Ed had been working explicitly (and courageously) on happiness. In
fifteen years he had moved the empirical study of happiness---he called
it "subjective well-being"---from academic laughingstock to respectable
psychometric endeavor, and as an emblem of his success, he was now
editor in chief of the toughest of all the social journals, The Journal
of Personality and Social Psychology. He was the methodologist's
methodologist. No pushover, he had kept his journal's rejection rate at
over 90 percent. He didn't care if Aristotle had said it or not, but it
had to be impeccably measured. Mike Csikszentmihalyi was the same size
as Ed, and we could still see evidence of the rock-climbing athlete he
had been as a youngster. The flow that Mike experienced clambering up
mountains and ascending sheer cliffs dominated his theorizing, and he
insisted that the experience of flow was central to well-being. But was
flow, which is characterized by the absence of any thoughts or feelings,
part of subjective well-being? He told us that when he asked people what
they were thinking or feeling in flow, they usually said, "Nothing."
Could it be, he mused, that the full attention that flow demands
parasitizes all our cognitive and emotional resources and so renders us
mindless? Completing the circle and on my right was my own intellectual
hero, Robert Nozick. Bob was now, with his Harvard colleague John Rawls,
arguably the leading philosopher in the world. He was fighting off the
intestinal cancer that took his life four years later. I worried about
inviting him to Cayman for fear that his laser-like style would cut and
slash and overwhelm and paralyze our group of slower psychologists. My
fear was groundless. Bob was thoroughly constructive---except about
Aristotle---and he became the epicenter of the group. There was only one
young person in the hot tub, Derek Isaacowitz, a newly minted PhD of
mine, an assistant professor at Brandeis, and our

recording secretary. Except for Derek, no one was under fifty, and
conscious of this, we all endorsed the young psychologists from Akumal
as the heirs to the big tent. What would positive psychology's subject
matter be? We liked the idea of "fulfillment." Surely that would include
happiness and its cousins. Ed Diener did not need to convince us of
this. Happiness--- subjective well-being---is measurable and may even be
buildable. But the existence of flow convinced us that positive
psychology could not be limited just to the subjective. Flow was a
positive fulfillment as well, but we were now using behavioral as well
as subjective criteria: "positive" denoted what free people who are not
suffering choose. Human beings pursue both the experience of positive
emotion and the experience of flow. So positive experience became one
"fulfillment" of positive psychology. Was that it? Could we stop with
happiness and flow and go home? "No," Kathleen argued. "Not by a
longshot. Sociology is all about the negative institutions, the forces
that impede well-being: crime, poverty, racism and the like. How about
the positive institutions that allow for well-being? Democracy, free
press, strong families, and volunteering, for instance." We were
convinced, and the study of civic fulfillment became a pillar of
positive psychology. Bob Nozick now made the case for another pillar,
positive traits, the individual qualities that enable positive
experience. "Psychiatry," he said, "is the study of insanity, the
negative traits that cripple life. Depression, schizophrenia, drug
addiction, and the like. What about sanity? What about the traits that
are the springboards of positive experience? Creativity, integrity,
humor, and courage, for example." Bob called these traits the mansions
of life. We spent a long time debating this. How about the state/trait
dispute, an ongoing debate in psychology? Are there really enduring
personality traits or only temporarily held states of mind? Ed Diener
led the way here. He convinced us that there are indeed traits,
dispositions to think and behave that transcend time and situation, and
that only poor measurement supported "situationism," the argument that
all of what drives behavior is in the environment and not in individual
character. Integrity, humor,

social intelligence, and courage are as real and knowable as
schizophrenia, depression, and alcoholism. What about the arbitrariness
of "good" in good character? Surely this changes from culture to
culture, epoch to epoch, floating on whatever religion or politics runs
the show at the time. We doubted such sweeping relativism and thought
the universality of goodness was an empirical issue whose testing we
should sponsor. I took away from Grand Cayman that positive psychology
would have three pillars: positive experience, positive traits, and
positive institutions. Its task would be to study and to build these
pillars. Our Cayman work was done. "SHE IS THE real thing," whispered
Paul Baltes, now director of the Max Planck Institute for Human
Development in Berlin. He was referring to Barbara Fredrickson, who was
speaking to about sixty of us at the Gallup Corporation headquarters in
Lincoln, Nebraska. It was September 1999, and this was the first
international summit of positive psychology, the kickoff Don Clifton had
promised. There was an atmosphere of high excitement, as if the audience
was glimpsing a new world in every presentation. Barb, a new assistant
professor at Michigan, was a statuesque brunette, slow and careful with
every word. She was a commanding intellectual presence, and we were on
the edge of our seats.

Barbara Fredrickson revealed at the first Gallup summit her "broaden and
build" theory: positive emotion broadens the cognitive and behavioral
repertoire, and positive emotion builds new strengths. Photo courtesy of
the International Positive Psychology Association.

"Evolution has selected negative emotion for fight and flight. Why would
evolution have bothered with positive emotion? Why do we have positive
feelings?" she mused. She now revealed for the first time her "broaden
and build" theory: positive emotion broadens the cognitive and
behavioral repertoire and builds new strengths. She had tested the
theory and presented evidence for it, such as showing that inducing
positive emotion in the laboratory broadened people to holistic, rather
than punctate, cognitive processing. Happy people see the wholes more
readily than the parts. "Is she married?" Paul whispered. Margaret, his
wife and academic partner of thirty years, had recently died of cancer,
and though bereaved, Paul found intellectual power the sexiest of
feminine charms. "She is, unfortunately," I informed Paul as I thought
about eros and the hidden, dirty secret of how strongly it powers
education, the progress of science, and the life of the mind. "The force
that through the green fuse drives the flower drives my green age," I
added, but Paul, who knew Rainer Maria Rilke but not Dylan Thomas,
frowned and looked puzzled. I also met Robert Biswas-Diener. Robert,
goateed and handsome, was in his early twenties, the oldest of Ed
Diener's five children. Robert

would soon become the Indiana Jones of positive psychology. I asked him
perfunctorily how he was enjoying the summit, and his answer threw me
for a loop. "I am so proud of my father. I love him so much," He
responded. Ed had just given a rousing talk about the measurement of
happiness and his uphill struggle over the last two decades to put
positive emotion on the academic map. No possible response to his
struggle would please Ed more than Robert's, and I have never told Ed
what Robert said. I do hope Ed reads this chapter. SO POSITIVE
PSYCHOLOGY was launched by the end of 1999. At a personal

level, it began with an epiphany in my garden with Nikki, a vision of
what psychology might become. At an institutional level, Ray Fowler,
Mike Csikszentmihalyi, and I plotted out a trajectory for the
development of the new field, a trajectory that became a reality over
the next decade. The Templeton Foundation and Atlantic Philanthropies
provided ample, generous funding just at the right time, and most
importantly a large group of senior and junior scientists spelled out
its mission, and we spread a big tent to welcome scientists and
practitioners in.

Chapter Twenty

Good Character (2000--2004)

VIRTUE WAS A leitmotif of nineteenth-century moral thought, and the
psychology of that era cared deeply about virtue. Abraham Lincoln's
first inaugural address appealed to the "better angels of our nature" in
the vain hope that they would turn Americans away from the looming Civil
War. The mental hospitals of the day used "moral therapy" to try to
treat the insane. This was not in vain, and cures were indeed reported.
But the better-angels morality had a dark side called "vice," and just
as it explained good behavior as virtue, it commonly explained bad
behavior as vice---bad character. Thinking about virtue and vice was
galvanized on May 4, 1886, in Haymarket Square, Chicago.1 There was a
violent confrontation between the laborers of the McCormick factory
(mostly immigrants) and the police, seen by labor as the brutal
enforcers of management. It turned into a riot, and a bomb exploded,
killing seven policemen. The common explanation for the bombing (whose
perpetrators were never caught) both in the press and on the tongues of
laymen was vice: the immigrants were evil, cruel, brutal, and wanton;
they were anarchists. But it did not escape the notice of some of the
press and much of the liberal clergy that the conditions of life for
these laborers were abysmal: overcrowded, filthy housing, illiteracy,
starvation wages, and twelve-hour workdays, six days a week. Perhaps
rather than bad character, the appalling environment that these
immigrants suffered had caused their violence. Social science was
conceived around this notion: its scientific agenda was to show that
perpetrators were not bad people and were not responsible for their
apparently "immoral" behavior. Rather the awful conditions they endured
drove them to it. So if a toxic environment caused crime and brutality,
an enlightened science and politics could eliminate crime

merely by improving the environment. If ignorance caused prejudice,
universal education would end prejudice. If poverty was not just defined
as a lack of money but caused by it, welfare---subsidizing the poor---
would end poverty. This was a noble vision indeed, and carrying it out
required a change in thinking about human nature. Nurture was doing the
dirty work, and we had to dispense altogether with vice and bad
character as explanations. The eagerness with which post-Victorians
lapped up Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and even Charles Darwin stemmed from
this vision: Marx blamed labor violence on alienation from work. Freud
blamed neurosis on unresolved childhood conflicts. Darwin blamed strife
on the primordial struggle to survive. The violent laborers, the
unbearable neurotics, the bullies, and a whole host of malefactors were
not themselves at fault. Blame lay with how they were nurtured. But
along with the bathwater of blaming victims, free will, responsibility,
and even virtue also got poured down the drain. But virtue stayed alive
in one corner of social science, psychology--- at least until Gordon
Allport, from his chair at Harvard, proscribed all reference to
character. Virtue---good character---was annoyingly Victorian,
distinctly Protestant, and value laden. Psychology, in Allport's view,
was a science that described but did not prescribe, and so endorsing a
value or a person who displayed good character was not the role of
social science. "Personality," a value-free descriptor, replaced
"character."2 Big mistake. Positive psychology, as I see it, requires
character. This field is the study of positive experience, positive
institutions, and positive traits. First, why is "trait" indispensable?
I am convinced that human beings have dispositions to behave
consistently over time and across situations---not 100 percent
consistently, of course, but enough above zero to make calling someone
smart or loving or mean or weak sensible---and it is likely a universal
across cultures, and all languages likely have words for traits. So
traits are undeniable. Second, why "positive"? This word formally means
"above indifference" or chosen in preference to nothing, and there are
many such preferred traits. Perhaps they vary from culture to culture,
but most politics, religions, and cultures that I know of endorse
kindness, wisdom, integrity, and courage. Importantly, this does not
mean that positive psychology as a science prescribes good character;
rather it describes, studies, and asks how to build what is prescribed
within the culture. Positive psychology does not

do the prescribing; the values of the culture or the individual do that.
Positive psychology is an exercise not in changing values but in helping
cultures and individuals better achieve what they already value.
Psychiatry-as-usual already had its extensive catalogue of negative
traits: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The DSM catalogued
the insanities: schizophrenia, psychopathy, panic disorder, autism, and
the like. It listed more than three hundred of them in fact, along with
their gender ratios, heritability, course, prognoses, and diagnostic
criteria. "How about a manual of the sanities?" I asked Neal Mayerson.
Neal had written to ask if he could fund positive psychology. His
parents, Manuel and Rhoda Mayerson, had made their fortune in Cincinnati
and turned it to good works under Neal's direction. I was beginning to
detect a new pattern of fund-raising after my history of begging the
government for research money for disorders for the last forty years.
People like Sir John and Dr. Jack Templeton, Chuck Feeney, Don Clifton,
and the Mayersons were now giving private, self-made fortunes away to
discover and build what is good in life, and the donors were seeking me
out, not the other way around. One person, Jim Hovey, even spontaneously
wrote me a large check right after a speech I gave at the Union League
in Philadelphia. "Do good stuff," Jim said laconically. Neal asked me
for advice about what to fund within positive psychology. Whatever we
funded must not gather dust in some library, Neal insisted. So he and I
convened a two-day meeting of possible awardees, but none of them hit
the bull's-eye for Neal. He wanted a project that would do good but also
result in a product that might generate further income for his
foundation to then give away. Mindful of the fortune that DSM had made
for the American Psychiatric Association, a publication that floats much
of Big Pharma and a bit of psychotherapy, I suggested a manual of good
character---a manual of sanity. "I'll give you a million dollars to
produce an un-DSM along with a questionnaire to measure character
strengths," Neal offered. "I don't think I can do it, Neal, but I know
who can." IT WAS CHRIS PETERSON'S fiftieth birthday, but I was not
phoning him

ceremonially. "What are you doing with the rest of your life?" I came
right out and

asked. Long silence. "I'd like you to take a three-year sabbatical from
the University of Michigan and come to Penn," I said. Chris was head of
Michigan's clinical program, among the top three graduate clinical
psychology programs (Yale and UCLA are the other two, with Penn ranking
next). He was a legend at Michigan for being enormously generous with
his time and knowledge, and everyone loved him. He also had the
qualities to make the Mayerson project work: high psychometric
expertise, broad scholarship, a deep knowledge of personality and
abnormal psychology, stamina, a strong friendship with me, patience, and
an overflow of good humor. "I want you to take charge of writing a DSM
of good character and virtue, and then I want you to create a
questionnaire to measure good character," I said. Longer silence. "Yes,"
said Chris. CHRIS DROVE HIS aging jalopy from Ann Arbor to Philadelphia
(he was

afraid of flying) in the fall of 2000 to begin our new collaboration. He
listened to talk radio all the way and told me all about Rush Limbaugh.
Totaling up the number of hours we spent together and multiplying by the
harmony of each hour, Chris became the longest-running and closest
colleague I have ever had. Our work was pretty one-sided. Chris read and
read and thought and thought: early Christian theology, Karl Marx,
Buddhist chants, Benjamin Franklin, Islamic virtues. Twice a week over
lunch he told me about strengths and virtues across time and space. He
told me about the Lakota virtue of generosity. He told me about the Budo
virtue, Rei, courtesy and etiquette. He told me about Hufflepuff:
loyalty and hard work. He told me about the Klingon virtue: to avenge
insults against the family for seven generations. We were searching for
universals, strengths endorsed by every religion, politics, and culture.
It turned out that there was a lot of agreement across history and
culture. I listened and reacted, mostly nodding my head approvingly. We
developed the criteria for including a strength in our manual, among
them the following:

1. A strength is valued in its own right, not as a means to an end
(i.e., intelligence, like perfect pitch, is not a strength valued in its
own right; rather it is valued as a means to success). 2. There are
paragons and prodigies of the strength and also idiots, people
egregiously devoid of the strength. 3. A strength is endorsed
universally (or at least ubiquitously). 4. A strength contributes to
fulfillment in life. Chris and I spent hundreds of hours, and I ate
hundreds of grilled Reubens, arguing over which candidates fit these
criteria. Kindness fit. Wisdom fit. Vitality fit. Social intelligence
fit. Tolerance did not, because it was not (universally) valued in Salt
Lake City or Mecca. Obedience? The Boy Scouts and Merlin liked it, but
the feminist movement did not. Chastity? The Victorians espoused it, but
the commune movement rejected it. How about humor? That one was close.
Everyone thinks he or she has a sense of humor (universality), and Chris
was in fact a remarkable sotto voce stand-up comic. But I was not sure
humor was important enough to make the list. Chris wore me down, arguing
that humor was a transcendent strength that amplified all the others. We
eventually narrowed the list down to twenty-four strengths and then
grouped them, somewhat arbitrarily, under six virtues: wisdom, courage,
humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. With the help of more
than a dozen experts, one for each strength, we drafted a humungous
document (when published3 it weighed in at about five pounds). After an
introduction in which we justified the need for a manual of sanity, we
reviewed the history of virtue and the attempts at previous
classifications. We then organized the rest of the book around the
twenty-four strengths, one chapter for each. Each chapter had a parallel
structure, and the chapter on forgiveness and mercy is an example. It
opened with a profile of a paragon, Kim Phuc, the naked little girl
napalmed by an American plane during the Vietnam War, immortalized in
the horrific iconic photograph. She publicly and movingly forgave the
pilot when she met him years later. We then defined forgiveness and
discussed the philosophical and religious stances on it, as well as
contemporary views. We next reviewed the measures of forgiveness (there
were two well-honed tests), then the correlates and consequences (e.g.,
forgiving people have less negative emotion), what

was known about how forgiveness develops across the life span (e.g.,
young children are unforgiving), the factors that inhibit or enable
forgiveness (e.g., disagreeable and highly neurotic people are
unforgiving), and the gender, national, and cross-cultural factors.
Finally we reviewed the interventions that build forgiveness and ended
with what was not known about forgiveness. This was merely half of what
Chris accomplished in his three-year stint at Penn studying virtue. The
other half was empirical. Chris created questionnaires, and he was a
statistician. So using these skills he created the Values-in-Action
(VIA) Signature Strengths Test.4 The VIA includes ten items for each of
the twenty-four strengths and asks you to rate how closely each item
describes you. This results in a rank ordering of your strengths and
tells you your five greatest ones. In the fifteen years since Chris
created it, more than 3 million people have taken the test in English,
and many other people have taken it in German, Chinese, Japanese, and
Spanish. In addition to providing individual self-insight, the test is
widely used in business, schools, and therapy. The field of strengths
and virtues blossomed empirically. For example, which strengths go along
with which careers? Take a look at the figure below, which shows a
statistical graph (based on 83,000 people). First, when two strengths
are close together, if you have one, you likely have the other. So if
you have gratitude, you likely have love and kindness. But if two
strengths are far apart, if you have one, you will not likely have the
other: kind people are not creative or brave; prudent people have
honesty and modesty, but they do not have much zest and hope.

Second, strengths relate to profession. Teachers have kindness,
forgiveness, gratitude, and love, but professors lack those strengths.
Professors have creativity, bravery, and love of learning, which
teachers have in short supply. Administrators are fair, honest, and
modest but lack zest, hope, and curiosity. CEOs have these latter
strengths but lack fairness, honesty, and modesty. Do not, however, take
this figure as career advice. This tells you the strength profile of
people in a profession in general. It does not tell you the strengths of
the best practitioners, and the best teachers, for example, have humor
and zest, not just love and gratitude. I cannot give you a citation for
this tidbit, however, because Chris told it to me shortly before his
sudden death in 2012. With Chris's death, I lost my best and closest
colleague, and the field of strength and virtue became bereft.

Flourishing

Chapter Twenty-One

Sixty (2002)

AUGUST 12, 2002. And so it was my turn to speak at my sixtieth birthday
party. Tossing sleepless the night before, I reviewed my life. An
anxious child of troubled parents in a world at war. A brainy misfit in
a school for rich kids. A foot soldier in the skirmishes with
behaviorism. A captain in the battle to steer psychology away from
darkness and toward light, drawn into the future rather than driven by
the past. I had built a greenhouse, and we held my sixtieth birthday
party in it. The design was imperfect because I forgot a roof opener. So
the temperature soared to 140 degrees, and I needed three
air-conditioning units in the room to hold the event. The form of the
birthday party was a symposium given by the experts, some of them my
friends, on the seventh decade of life. George Vaillant was the master
of ceremonies. He was in his third decade of studying success and
failure in life among the Harvard men, who themselves were past their
sixties. George urged me to marshal my mature defenses, such as I had,
to make my way through this tricky decade. Burly Bob Olcott, recently
retired from the Albany Academy, reminded us of my (lack of) swimming
prowess as displayed at the waterfront of the Stratton Mountain Boy
Scout camp, and he seemed to have the benign illusion that I was a
decent football lineman. (I was an awful lineman, a physical coward, and
I quit as soon as I decently could.) Ed Diener and Chris Peterson, the
youngsters in this crowd, took a comic romp through my curriculum vitae.
Paul Rozin, my brother in arms during thirty years of department battles
at Penn, halfway into his own seventh decade, thought of this decade as
a sport in the Special Olympics: how much you can still do

with what you have left. Lara, twelve, Nikki, ten, and even Darryl,
eight, gave short speeches. "I had thought of my life as an
autobiography," I said when my turn came. "An uphill struggle in which I
pitted my strengths and skills against a world reluctant to yield up its
rewards to me but all too ready to sting and bite. "What I learned
today, from Bob Olcott and Kathleen Hall Jamieson and George Vaillant
and Ed Diener and Ray Fowler and Barry Schwartz and Mike
Csikszentmihalyi and Lester Luborsky and Chris Peterson--- but mostly
from Mandy---is that my life is not an autobiography but a biography.
The story of how I have been helped through the world by friendship,
colleagueship, generosity, and love." AS THE FIELD of positive
psychology burgeoned, I noticed that my life

was better---much better. I was happier and getting into better step
with the change in psychology itself, and the synchrony between my life
and this change is indeed the underlying theme of this book. But I must
untangle why my life was better at age sixty. The theory of happiness I
had at age sixty was simplistic: good externalities plus good
internalities equals happiness. I looked at the three great
externalities of life: love, work, and play. Each of these was much
better now in my own life. Mandy had created a home. The big house was
no longer an empty cavern. It was filled with children and Old English
sheepdogs (Barney and Rosie). The dogs were unfailingly cheerful, and
Mandy was generally a cumulus cloud. We homeschooled our children, not
out of ideology but because we were both teachers and our frequent trips
did not conform to the school calendar. So we designed our curriculum
around our travels and took the kids along. We took them to the
Galapagos to learn biology and evolution, but our teaching was
imperfect, as we saw when we met Lonesome George, an ancient tortoise
who may have been the last of his species. The conservators explained to
us that they were looking desperately for a female for him. "We're
cooking up tortoise Viagra," they told us. "What's Viagra?" Lara, Nikki,
and Darryl asked in unison. Our children had no clue. We had taught them
evolution without teaching them about sex. Oops. We took them with us on
my many business trips ---to Japan, Australia, England, Norway,
Germany---and their education emerged not from sitting at a school desk
but from reading, from visiting

museums, from walking through cities, and from sharing meals with our
many fascinating hosts. The kids' prevailing mood, since they were not
yet teenagers, was mostly sunny. The first externality in my life, love,
was much better. My work was much better---mostly because it was no
longer mine. When Ray Fowler told me that his job as CEO of the American
Psychological Association was to bring out the best in his presidents, I
realized that my job as president was to bring out the best in my
colleagues. This must be Erik Erikson's "generativity" stage, I
realized, and I was relieved to have reached it. Stalinism died with
Stalin, whereas positive psychology had from the outset many fathers and
now many mothers. From the first, we decided to erect a big tent that
would comfortably shelter and nurture many agendas: Mike
Csikszentmihalyi's on flow, Chris Peterson's and Neal Mayerson's on
virtue, Ed Diener's on subjective well-being, George Vaillant's on
successful aging, Kathleen Hall Jamieson's on positive civic
institutions, and, more recently, Barb Fredrickson's on positive
emotion, Jon Haidt's on awe, Sonja Lyubomirsky's on interventions, and
Laura King's on meaning. My own prior agenda, prevention of mental
illness, was only a wee part, and my main job was to promote everyone
else's agendas. I raised money but seemed to be best at asking the right
questions at the right time in order to move their agendas forward
scientifically. I could listen better, and I could swerve, or even
jettison my own interests with advice and criticism. My critics now
called me "nimble," which I took as a compliment. And so the second
externality, work, had never been better. Easily overlooked is the third
externality, play. I hosted a poker game once a week and joyfully lost
more than \$2,000 a year, a fair exchange for my only all-male
locker-room companionship. But real play for me was bridge, and I had
taken up serious tournament bridge again. The game had transformed since
my youth. Many of the "bridge bums" who slept in their cars and hoped
someone would pay them twenty-five dollars for an afternoon partnership
were now multimillionaires. A new profession arose in the 1980s, and
bridge genius translated into real money. I would never have guessed the
profession: not law, not computer programming, and not poker. It was
options trading. Something about the mind of the natural in bridge made
him fast and accurate at spotting small discrepancies in stock prices.
Bridge players

now made up entire flourishing firms, and at least half of the top
hundred players in America traded options during the day and competed as
major bridge champions at night.

We took Lara, Nikki, and Darryl with us on my many business trips to
Japan, Australia, China, England, Norway, Germany, Brazil, and Chile,
and their education emerged not from sitting at a school desk but from
reading, from visiting museums, from walking through cities, and from
sharing meals with our many fascinating hosts. The kids' prevailing
mood, since they were not yet teenagers, was mostly sunny. Photo

I was not a natural or a bridge genius, but I loved the game, and so to
play serious bridge I hired my partners: Paul Soloway, Eric Rodwell, and
Mark Lair, three of the all-time greats. They taught me the high-level
game, and I was now comfortable sitting down against the best in the
world. My Albany Academy class prophecy in 1960 was "Marty Seligman wins
a world bridge championship by executing a Vienna Coup." It almost came
true: Paul Soloway and I won the world internet championship in 1998
against a team of young, jet-lagged Russians. But there was no Vienna
Coup (a rare bridge play comparable almost to a hole-in-one in golf).
The next day, however, my son David joined the game, and sure enough, I
executed a Vienna Coup. So my externalities, love, work, and play, were
better than they had ever been. In the long history of the words for
"happiness" across many languages and cultures, such good externalities
should make me a

"happy" man, since the words until recently denoted good fortune or
luck. But "happiness" in the last two centuries has taken on the
internalities of how one feels and how one thinks: subjective
well-being. Now you can't be happy unless you also feel good. My
internalities sucked. They seemed to me about as bad as they had always
been from late childhood on. I was still a depressive and a pessimist,
the redeeming feature being that such firsthand knowledge helped me
greatly in my work. I was not lighthearted and had little in the way of
merriment. I rarely felt joy. I often woke up at four a.m. and brooded.
I was a catastrophizer, and when a setback occurred, the worst possible
outcome drew my first thought like a magnet. Of course, I knew every
trick in the book to counter depression, pessimism, and catastrophizing
and to build positive emotion. Indeed, I invented some of them. These
worked pretty well for me, but the voices---You are a loser, you are a
failure, you are doomed---were still there. So by internalities I was
not a happy man. But there is a redeeming possibility about my gloomy
internalities: the interaction of my internals with my externals. My
commerce with the world had changed for the better since I got involved
in positive psychology. Thanks to Chris, I had now identified my
signature strengths ---among them creativity and leadership---and I now
used them well, albeit far from perfectly, with my fellows. My
creativity had two parts: contrarian originality, which had been with me
for a long time, and an appreciation of my audience and my
collaborators. This appreciation was newer. I knew a lot of psychology
now, but more importantly I could connect the dots from one field to the
next. I could see what projects might fly and which were quagmires. I
could see who the right person for that special place in the jigsaw
puzzle was and how to help her arrive there. My leadership style,
learned from Ray Fowler, was to bring out the best in others and so to
help them achieve their agendas. Maybe internalities were not all they
were cracked up to be. Maybe internalities are almost unchangeable. But
by the criterion of good commerce with the world, I was a pretty happy
man.

Chapter Twenty-Two

Positivity and Its Critics (2001--2011)

POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY EXPLODED in popularity after 2001. I was so
accustomed to uphill battles that I was taken aback. Once the field
became popular, however, a legion of critics sprang up, some with
constructive ideas that advanced it, but more than a few with weak
arguments or criticisms that attacked straw men. This chapter tells the
story of some of the major advances between 2001 and 2011 and the main
criticisms. I first present the progress made and then the criticisms,
divided by strong and weak (or even baseless) criticisms, followed by my
responses. Progress "This positive psychology is becoming quite the
thing," said Sam Preston, my dean. Sam was a distinguished demographer
and more adventurous than my previous deans. Sam and I were about to
embark on an adventure that is still in progress. "You should have a
center, a Positive Psychology Center, Marty. Come see me next week," Sam
said over drinks. A "center," in the narrow world of the University of
Pennsylvania, sets one free from a "department." A center is
interdisciplinary and can have its own grants, missions, and employees,
but it cannot make tenure-track professorial appointments; only
departments can do that. Centers historically tend to do the
cutting-edge, controversial scientific research, whereas departments
tend to be highly conservative, rewarding their faculty for laying one
brick safely upon another. Departments usually appoint new faculty who
are nachschleppers rather than innovators. After years of losing battles
over appointing such nachschleppers, Sam's get-out-of-

jail-free proposal appealed to my entrepreneurial instincts. A center
also reports to the dean rather than the department chair, and its
"profits" (read "overheads") go to the dean. "How will we swing it
financially?" I asked Sam as we sat down in his spacious,
Pennsylvania-memorabilia-lined office. "I want you to create a new
master's degree, Marty, a master of applied positive psychology. You can
admit successful adults from the real world as graduate students and
then teach them how to apply positive psychology to their lines of work.
They can come to Penn in an executive education model: nine long
weekends of classes a year, with visiting star professors doing most of
the teaching, and a capstone thesis. The students will pay full tuition
(around \$50,000 in 2018 dollars), and the center will get 30 percent of
the surplus, if any, to run itself. 'Surplus' starts at the break-even
point of eleven students. And of course you can get your usual grants
and contracts." I ASKED JAMES PAWELSKI to direct the fledgling program.
An assistant

professor of philosophy and religion at Vanderbilt University, James had
been commuting to Penn to audit my courses, and he was incorporating
positive psychology into his own undergraduate teaching. Happily he
signed up as director of education, and we began in March 2005 to
advertise for students to meet an April 30 deadline, hoping against hope
for eleven applicants. We got more than one hundred, and thirty-five of
them met Penn's very stiff Ivy League admission requirements.
Thirty-four accepted our offer of admission. The Positive Psychology
Center and the Master of Applied Positive Psychology1 (MAPP) program of
the University of Pennsylvania were launched. IN MID-FIFTEENTH CENTURY
Florence, Cosimo the Elder was the patron of

a new humanism, a flourishing of the arts, learning, and science later
known as the Renaissance. In Cosimo Medici's honor, the brand-new
Positive Psychology Center held a three-year celebration, Medici 2. In
the late spring of each year, the leading senior figures in positive
psychology, along with a passel of junior fellows, would live together
and meet daily for two months. I chose this season because my roses were
blooming, and we would spend many of our hours together enjoying
Alchemysts, Climbing Fourth of Julys, Abraham Darbys, and

Trojan Victories, all ablaze with the promise of full summer. Out of
Medici 2 emerged some progress. One big success: Ed Diener led a group
working to create "national accounts of well-being." Could we measure
how well a nation was doing? Gross domestic product (GDP), the usual
contemporary national account, was increasingly out of sync with
well-being. GDP measures the total goods and services bought and sold,
but GDP fails to distinguish goods and services that promote well-being
from those that diminish well-being. Robert Kennedy in 1968 criticized
GDP poignantly and accurately: Yet the gross national product does not
allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or
the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or
the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or
the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor
our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion
nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except
that which makes life worthwhile. GDP includes what economists call
"regrettables." With every suicide, divorce, or automobile accident, GDP
goes up. The funeral expenses, the legal fees, the hospital costs, and
the repair bills all add to GDP. The more tobacco sold, the higher the
GDP. Moreover, all graphs of national income against life satisfaction
yield rapidly diminishing returns with more income once one is well
above the safety net. This is true of national GDP and individual
income, with roughly \$100,000 per year in the United States being the
inflection point at which increasing income brings markedly diminishing
increases in happiness. "It's the economy, stupid," is a stupid account
of human flourishing. Ed Diener assumed that we wanted to measure
flourishing and that GDP, though a good start historically, was now
outmoded. He was after a set of well-being indicators that would
complement economic indicators and so assist policymaking for
governments and corporations that sought the flourishing of their
citizens and employees. I called this goal the "new prosperity." Ed's
visionary initiative resulted first in a landmark paper, "Beyond

Money: Toward an Economy of Well-being,"2 which made this case
compellingly. Ed was kind enough to put my name on the paper. Soon
thereafter, a gaggle of world-class economists---Richard Layard, Amartya
Sen, Ned Phelps, John Helliwell, Jeffrey Sachs, and Joseph
Stiglitz---trained their sights on happiness, and once these
governmentadvising economists got into the act, well-being found its way
onto the political agenda. Nicolas Sarkozy, the prime minster of France,
formed a commission to recommend new measures of national success, and
David Cameron, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, announced that
he would measure the well-being of UK citizens every three months and
hold himself accountable for the success or failure of his policies by
changes in well-being. The European Left angrily accused Sarkozy and
Cameron of trying to distract people with the sop of "happiness" now
that these governments were failing to grow their economies. In addition
to national accounts of well-being, a second bit of progress was the
creation of an Authentic Happiness website (www.authentichappiness.org)
that contained the major tests of wellbeing. In the process of creating
the website, I broadened my theory of well-being. I had posited three
basic elements: positive emotion, engagement, and meaning.3 An "element"
is what free, nonsuffering people choose to pursue for its own sake. But
in teaching MAPP and thinking about what questionnaires to put on the
website, I now became convinced that there were five elements of
well-being: PERMA.4 Positive emotion Engagement Relationships Meaning
Accomplishment I revised the theory after considering how commonly
people pursue achievement doggedly for its own sake: even if it brings
no happiness, no flow, no relationships, and no meaning.5 In 2018 there
are now two more claimants as elements: physical health and control. But
I am not yet convinced, and five is a more parsimonious number than
seven. The Authentic Happiness website was originally in English,
Chinese (both simple and complex characters), and Spanish, and over the
years

we added German, Japanese, and Korean. The site was widely used in all
these languages, but we did not seem to have made it over the Great
Internet Wall in China. Although positive psychology became very popular
in that country, our website was almost invisible there. We continually
added new surveys, refined old ones, and shared our data with
researchers around the world. An average of 2,000 new visitors signed up
daily, and as of this writing over 4.5 million people have registered
from more than two hundred nations. It is a goldmine for researchers,
and the findings about signature strengths in the last chapter come from
analyzing this website's dataset. We also set up a listserv
(friends-of-PP@lists.apa.org), and I invite you to join the still highly
active discussions that occur 24/7. Our new website was marvelous for
interventions, both as a way of testing new ones and also as a
futuristic way of delivering interventions on a massive scale. As the
reader knows from my Consumer Reports tale, I spent a lot of effort on
what psychotherapies and what drugs worked for what disorders. Testing
these was very expensive and very time-consuming. Worse, the results
were often inconclusive because live clinical studies can afford only
small and unrepresentative volunteer samples. A typical "well-done"
efficacy study divides forty clinic volunteers randomly into two groups,
with half given an active drug or psychotherapy and half given a
plausible placebo. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) budgets
even for such small studies can run into the low seven figures. Even the
Consumer Reports survey, with a sample one hundred times this size, cost
about this much to run. The website seemed a much cheaper way of testing
new positive interventions with large samples. Can individuals do simple
exercises to raise their happiness, and might these exercises also lower
depression? Time magazine did a cover story on positive psychology in
January 2005.6 With Jeff Levy, a Philadelphia MD entrepreneur, we set up
another website, Reflective Happiness, for the public to do these
exercises. We gave them out free at first and hoped that, if they
worked, people would pay a few dollars to subscribe for more exercises.
Reading Time, lots of people came and took a free exercise called "Three
Blessings": every night for a week, you'd write down three things that
went well that day and why they went well. At this point we had lots of
evidence from random-assignment placebo-control studies that this
exercise reliably lowered depression and raised life satisfaction for as

long as six months. I wanted to know if this would work for people who
were severely depressed, more depressed than the mildly depressed people
who typically came to authentichappiness.org. The results from the first
month were startling. Fifty people fell into the severely depressed
range when they registered. Their average depression score was 34, a
score bad enough to indicate that these people were in pain: suffering a
lot of sadness, crying a lot, very passive, feeling no zest and major
loss of pleasure, and usually functioning very poorly, if at all, in
work and at home. Thirty-four is close to extreme depression. These
fifty people did the exercise and came back to the website two weeks
later to take their second depression test. Their depression scores on
average got much better, to 17.2, which is right at the cusp of mild to
moderate symptoms. Forty-seven of the fifty people (94 percent)
decreased in depression. Their happiness scores, which averaged 53.4
(roughly in the bottom 10 percent) to begin with, zoomed up to 69.8 on
average at posttest. This elevated them to the fortieth percentile on
happiness, and forty-six of the fifty people (92 percent) increased in
happiness. These results were comparable, perhaps superior, to the
effects of medication and psychotherapy in severe depression. My
colleague, Robert DeRubeis, a leading outcome researcher in depression,
shared some of his typical findings with me for rough-and-ready
comparison: over four weeks, combined cognitive therapy and medication
decreased depressive symptoms from 34.1 to 19.6 (n = 134) versus a
placebo, which went from 34.8 to 24.4 (n = 49). I was cautious about
these dramatic results. I did not run out and shout that web exercises
could cure severe depression, since our method had plenty of flaws: no
random assignment, no placebo control, no diagnosis of major depression,
and no long follow-up. And of course, unlike the usual severely
depressed person arriving at therapy, these people came with high
Time-induced hopes. Even with such promising initial findings, use of
the website dropped, and not enough paying subscriptions came in to keep
the business afloat for more than one year. We failed to raise
additional funding. Reflective Happiness flopped as a business, and I
never published these results, but I left this arena impressed by the
potential of web therapy for depression. Two of my graduate students,
Acacia Parks and Stephen Schueller, took up the cause, but its long-term
future was hard to predict. There are not

enough face-to-face therapists to cope with the sheer amount of
depression in our society, so it should be viable. It was dirt cheap and
could be mass-distributed, and in my heart of hearts I believed it was
almost as effective as psychotherapy and medication. So why would web
therapy not prevail? The competition was stiff, and the playing field
was not level. Psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, social workers,
and marriage and family counselors formed often self-protective guilds.
The pharmaceutical companies raked in huge profits for their
antidepressant drugs and did not welcome being undercut. But another,
almost entirely unnoticed factor was even more important than this
competition: a discrepancy between patent law and copyright law in the
United States that has stifled---perhaps killed---the development of
psychotherapy. If you discover a drug that works at all in depression,
you can patent it, corner the market, and make out like a bandit. If you
discover a psychotherapy or an exercise that works just as well or even
much better, you cannot make serious money. You can only copyright the
words. "Fair use" law means that if a competitor merely changes a few
words, calling the exercise "What Went Well" rather than "Three
Blessings," and makes a few other cosmetic refinements, that competitor
is in business. Big Pharma's patent monopoly endows it with a massive
war chest to trumpet its drugs, even if they are only marginally
effective. Our initial results from the web exercise were at least as
good as those for any antidepressant drug, but we could not raise enough
money to keep the website going, and the public was deprived of a likely
effective antidepressant treatment. The reason: Who would invest in a
product that, if effective, could be so easily and legally ripped off?
So there was minimal financial incentive to develop and promote
effective psychotherapy and verbal exercises for mental illness. Once
you do all the work and pour your money into promulgating them, any
wealthy company could come along, change a few words, out-advertise you,
create a jazzier website, and run you out of business. I COUNTED THE
website a success, even if the business failed, for it led to

positive psychotherapy. Tayyab Rashid and his new wife, Afroze, came
from Pakistan to take their PhDs at Fairleigh Dickinson University, and
then Tayyab charmed his way into becoming my postdoctoral fellow at the
Positive

Psychology Center. He did not want to make a lot of money; he wanted to
do a lot of good. Pakistan, it seemed to me, needed a megadose of
positive psychology, and when the time was ripe, Afroze and Tayyab were
my candidates to lead it. "Let's bundle all these web exercises together
into the hands of skilled therapists and test them in face-to-face
therapy with severe depressives," Tayyab suggested. It was the next
step, but I expressed doubt that it would work. Undeterred, Tayyab
boldly tested positive psychotherapy against antidepressant medications
and cognitive therapy over fourteen sessions with patients diagnosed
with major depression.

Tayyab Rashid tested a fourteen-session ensemble of positive
psychotherapy against antidepressant medications and against cognitive
therapy with diagnosed major depression. It was superior to both. Photo

"Well, it worked, Marty," Tayyab told me as he spread the data sheets
all over my work table. "Look at this." He had carried out a full-blown
pilot study with severe depressives: eleven clients in individual
positive psychotherapy, nine in treatment-as-usual, and twelve in
treatment-asusual plus antidepressant drugs. The results were startling:
positive psychotherapy worked markedly better on all measures than the
usual treatment and better than the usual treatment plus drugs.7 Given
these very encouraging data, we applied for a grant from

NIMH. It was turned down administratively without even the bother of any
reviews. Annoyed, I saw NIMH more and more in the service only of
neuroscience and Big Pharma. It had by now given up on psychotherapy.
Discouraged, Tayyab decamped for Toronto, Canada, where he carried out
study after study, each showing good effects of positive psychotherapy.
We reviewed fifteen randomized trials in Positive Psychotherapy: A
Manual.8 But in the absence of the expensive, definitive, larger-scale,
random-assignment outcome studies, which only NIMH could afford to fund,
I remained an optimist about positive psychotherapy but skeptical that
it would become as widespread as it deserves to be in my lifetime.
Critics and Criticisms Unlike in theater, where harsh criticism will
shut down a Broadway show, criticism in science is a main driver of
progress. Knowing this, I have always welcomed critics and shunned
ass-kissers. That said, I have never met anyone with "thick skin," and
in truth criticism almost always smarts and sometimes really wounds. For
me it depends on the kind of criticism. Oddly, the weaker the criticism,
the more it bothers me. The strongest criticisms---such as Dick
Herrnstein's "Animals only learn responses---they don't learn that
anything" in references to learned helplessness theory---sting, but they
invigorate me. They are testable and will eventually prove right or
wrong. For strong criticisms, truth will out. The weaker
criticisms---such as "Positive psychology is individualistic and
selfish, ignoring as it does other people"---wake me up at 4 a.m.
grinding my teeth. The really weak ones, the attacks on straw men, such
as "Positive psychology is oblivious to misery," drive me up the wall.
And the ad hominem attacks that cast me as the Darth Vader of psychology
make me wish I had stuck to playing bridge. I categorize the criticisms
as "strong" or "weak." I also touch on some of the "really nasty" stuff
from the trolls who roam the internet. Strong Criticisms Positive
psychology tells us nothing that my grandmother, St. Augustine, and my
Sunday school teacher did not already know. I heard this criticism often
when positive psychology was young, so I made a list of things I did not
know before it came along. Here is part of

the list of surprises I made ten years ago in a reply to John
Lanchester's "Well, duh" criticism of the obviousness of positive
psychology published in the New Yorker (February 27, 2006): • Optimistic
people are much less likely to die of heart attacks than pessimists,
controlling for all known physical risk factors.9 • Women who display
genuine (Duchenne) smiles to the class photographer at age eighteen go
on to have fewer divorces and more marital satisfaction than those who
display fake smiles.10 • Externalities (e.g., weather, money, health,
marriage, religion), totaled together, account for no more than 15
percent of the variance in life satisfaction.11 • Specific exercises
increase happiness and decrease depression six months later, while other
plausible exercises are mere placebos.12 • The pursuit of meaning and
engagement is much more predictive of life satisfaction than the pursuit
of pleasure.13 • Self-discipline is twice as good a predictor of high
school grades as IQ.14 • Happy teenagers go on to earn very
substantially more income fifteen years later than less happy teenagers,
equating for income, grades, and other obvious factors.15 • People
experience more "flow" at work than at home.16 And here are a few more
"I'll be darned" items I've discovered since then: • People who prefer
meaning (eudamonia) to pleasure (hedonia) have a distinguishable genetic
profile.17 • The belief that income inequality is fair goes a long way
to canceling the negative effect of income inequality on life
satisfaction.18 • Conservatives report themselves happier than liberals
do.19 • Mindfulness training makes you more resilient.20 POSITIVE
PSYCHOLOGY IS just old wine in new bottles. Abraham Maslow

and the humanistic psychology movement said it all forty years ago.
Indeed the humanistic psychologists were furious with me and the
positive psychology movement. They felt slighted and not properly
acknowledged. They laid into me mercilessly. Their anger was more than
partly justified. Abraham Maslow first used the term "positive
psychology," and his thinking was iconoclastic and antedated some of our
main ideas. In our inaugural article on positive psychology,21 Mike
Csikszentmihalyi and I foolishly lumped humanistic psychology together
with crystal healing and aromatherapy, and for my part I apologize for
this unwarranted slight. On the other hand, Abraham Maslow came too
early. Scientific psychology did not take him seriously. Maslow himself
recognized that he wanted scientific respect above all, and his research
assistant, Bob Gable, in a revealing personal letter in 2001, wrote me,
"Abe would have been happier with something that never happened---a
return phone call from Fred Skinner." Rather than carry out mainstream
science on his ideas, his followers, calling themselves humanistic
psychologists, developed their own qualitative and nonexperimental
methods. Humanistic psychology's then radical ideas about happiness,
combined with its less-than-rigorous methods, made it doubly difficult
for science to digest---hence its present status as a scientific
backwater separate from positive psychology.22 Positive psychology keeps
some of the radical ideas but uses conventional, rigorous methods. In
point of fact, spotty scholar that I am, I had not read much Maslow, and
so his writings played little role in my own thinking. Had I invoked
Maslow, however appropriately, it would have been window dressing.
Positive psychology arose directly from my take on the shortcomings of
mainstream clinical and experimental science. POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY IS
unnecessary. Psychology-as-usual aims to get rid

of what is bad. Human well-being follows automatically when all that is
bad is fixed. Is the good simply the absence of the bad? There are three
kinds of opposites: The first is when both extremes lie on the same
continuum. Temperature is like this. Hot and cold are opposites, but
they only

differ as a matter, literally, of degree. Hot is just less cold, and
cold is just less hot. The second kind of opposite is when one side is
well understood but the other side is nothing more than the absence of
the first side. "Colored" and "colorless" are like this: "colorless" has
no meaning except the absence of color. The third is when each side
forms its own distinct world with properties not deducible from the
absence of the properties of the other world. Civility is an example.
The presence of civility leads to cooperation, friendship, and loyalty.
Civility is a positive-sum game. Incivility leads to revenge, hate, and
divorce. Incivility is a negative-sum game. Civility and incivility are
different in kind, not just in degree. The benefits of civility are more
than just the absence of revenge, hate, and divorce, and the costs of
incivility are more than just the absence of cooperation, friendship,
and loyalty. Good and bad, positive and negative are this third kind of
opposite. The good and the bad each form their own unique worlds. e e
cummings said it best in his 1935 poem "love is a place": yes is a world
& in this world of yes live (skillfully curled) all worlds "The basic
mission of journalism is to uncover what is hidden," declared Bill
Moyers to the audience. What Bill Moyers thought about journalism was
holy writ among American journalists, and he was the speaker at the
Annenberg Public Policy Center at Penn. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the
director, chose me to be a discussant. "Imagine, Mr. Moyers, that
journalism was wholly successful, and it uncovered everything that was
hidden. Even further, imagine that journalism uncovered everything that
was wrong and hidden and further that journalism corrected everything
that was wrong," I said. "Where

would you have gotten to? "You would have gotten all the way up to...
zero," I paused for effect. "Not getting it wrong does not equal getting
it right. Has journalism no positive values? What is journalism's
positive vision? What is praiseworthy? Heroic? Virtuous? Is there not a
world above zero, a world that journalism should envision, praise,
nurture, and help to birth?" Bill Moyers took this seriously, and we
then spent an entire dinner wondering how positive journalism could ever
take off. We were joined by David Eisenhower, a faculty member at Penn
and the grandson of President Dwight Eisenhower, and most importantly by
his wife, Julie Nixon Eisenhower. She opined that her father, Richard
Nixon, was brought down by unremittingly negative journalism and
remarked on the almost complete absence of any counterbalancing
journalism about his virtues and strengths. History has been kinder to
him in this regard, but the ceaseless drumbeat of negativity and scandal
overwhelmed him. There is, of course, a long tradition of "positive"
journalism, but it is derided as fluff. Many journalists, in addition to
digging up dirt, write positive stories. These show up in the food
section, in local columns, in "feel-good" stories, and in what used to
be called the "women's pages." In its strongest and most widely read
form, positive journalism inhabits the sports pages. It is often said
that writing about heroism and virtue and skill cannot be as
commercially successful as uncovering scandal, but the popularity of the
sports pages should tell us that "If it bleeds, it leads" is not
necessary for commercial success. Positive psychology stood all the
usual questions on their heads for me, and my mantra was now "Not
getting it wrong does not equal getting it right." The tradition I cut
my teeth on, learning-theory-as-usual, made this mistake big time. From
E. L. Thorndike's cats in the puzzle box through B. F. Skinner's pigeons
pecking lighted keys, learning was said to be "trial and error." The
animal only gradually eliminated all that was wrong (the error trials)
and eventually whittled its "response" down to the right one. (The
emblematic story tells of Skinner lecturing to Harvard undergraduates,
who conspired to perk up and look interested only when Skinner moved
toward the left corner of the stage. Skinner, so the legend goes,
eventually wound up frozen in that corner.) The gradualness of the
"learning curve" in animals seemed to support this. But the apparently
gradual curve is often just an artifact of averaging a lot of sudden
step functions of different animals. So if ten rats are learning to
press a bar

for food, and each rat suddenly "gets" it by "insight," but each on a
different trial, suddenly---not gradually---learning what's right, the
averaged curve will look gradual even if composed only of insight
functions (e.g., rat 1 gets it on trial 2, rat 2 gets it on trial 5, rat
3 gets it on trial 12, etc.). In a classic experiment,23 the
experimenter nodded his head with approval whenever subjects said words
that ended in s. Averaged learning to say s appeared gradual, but when
results were broken down subject by subject, no learning occurred at all
until the subject could verbalize the insight that words ending in s, or
plural words, got head nodding. Then the subject jumped to 100 percent
right. Nature just cannot work by the enormously inefficient way of
gradually eliminating all possible errors. The poor animal would be long
dead before getting it right. Evolution will favor cognitive mechanisms
that help us to leap to the right answer, and animals (and people)
surely have evolved to get there more directly than by first eliminating
all the wrong pathways. In its modern cognitive incarnation, the
elimination-of-errors school, led perhaps unwittingly by Danny
Kahneman,24 made much out of ridding ourselves of cognitive errors. The
"recency" error, for example, makes us over-remember the most recent
event at the expense of failing to take into account the average over
the longer past, and the "availability" error has us overweighting what
is most attention grabbing. By eliminating these errors, so Kahneman
alleged, we will become more accurate. Eliminating errors is surely a
big help to accuracy, but it misses the boat about insight. Coming up
with the right answer usually involves much more than just eliminating
all these errors. We often just see what is right long before all errors
are eliminated, and this insightful leap is at the heart of nothing less
than creativity itself. That the positive adds properties over and above
the absence of the negative is very important for psychotherapy. When I
first became a therapist, I was taught, following the dogma of Freud and
Schopenhauer, that the best we can do is not suffer, so I aimed to help
patients get rid of all of their negatives: anger, sadness, and anxiety.
That done, therapy ended. Once in a while, we did very good work, and
these dysphorias cleared up completely. Did I get happiness? No, I got
an empty patient, because the skills for cultivating positive emotion,
engagement, meaning, and good relationships differ entirely from those
used to fight anger, anxiety, and depression.

So getting what is good in life entails a lot more than just eliminating
what is bad. POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY UNDERRATES the importance of the
external world.

To build more well-being, just allocate more money to making the world a
better place, and please don't mess with people's psyches. Using money,
usually tax money, to make a better external world has been the rallying
cry of social scientists and liberal politicians since the Haymarket
Square Riot of 1884. Since poverty is at the root of unhappiness, throw
money at it, and unhappiness will disappear. Since ignorance is at the
root of prejudice, spend more on education, and prejudice will
disappear. Since deprivation is at the root of crime, undo deprivation,
and crime will disappear. Who would dare speak against this? This
objection has some strong and some weak points. More money sometimes
works. Crime goes down during boom times and up when times are hard.
Prejudice seems to be on the decline, but it is not at all clear that
prosperity rather than the rule of law and simple goodness has played
much of a role. Happiness, however, does not seem to change much with
income, once people are above the safety net. So, for those below the
safety net, more money will produce more well-being. For those above the
safety net, more money sometimes might build more well-being,
particularly if explicitly spent on producing more well-being rather
than less ill-being. Over the last 130 years, almost all the financial
subsidies have been poured into alleviating ill-being: defense,
hospitals, and welfare are examples. These have worked but have not
produced more well-being, only less ill-being. A world that takes
well-being seriously and uses money to promote positive
institutions---strong families, beautiful surroundings, democracy,
uplifting entertainment, deep, lifelong education, women's reproductive
rights, and engrossing, active sports, for example---will increase
well-being directly. The strongest version of the importance of the
external world is the "objective list" theory of happiness,25 which
lodges happiness outside psychology and onto a list of "truly valuable"
things in the real world. Happiness in a human life consists of
achieving worthwhile pursuits: career accomplishment, friendship,
freedom from disease and pain, material comfort, civic spirit, beauty,
education, love, knowledge, and

good conscience. Consider the thousands of abandoned children living on
the streets of Luanda. As the New York Times tells us, "Dressed in rags,
they spend nights in the sandy strip along the bay, and their days
foraging for food through mounds of garbage." Their lives, consumed with
meeting momentary needs, adventurous roving in gangs, and casual sex,
with little thought for tomorrow, might actually be subjectively "happy"
and have high "life satisfaction." Very few people would classify such
an existence as "happy," however, since these children are deprived of
most things that would go on anybody's list of what is worthwhile in
life. So there is much truth in the view that making the external world
better increases happiness, and I for one take the quality of the
external world as seriously as the quality of the internal world as a
cause of happiness. Weak Criticisms Positive psychology is WEIRD: it is
based on Western, educated, industrial, rich, and democratic
societies.26 Positive psychology needs to be cross-cultural. These
critics have not done enough homework. Positive psychology, in fact,
involves research on well-being in more than two hundred nations and
from every major culture. A subfield and book series, Crosscultural
Advancements in Positive Psychology,27 seek a deep understanding of the
way culture influences differences in well-being. is the solution to
achieving more well-being. Above the safety net, more income does not
really have diminishing returns on life satisfaction. If you replot the
y-axis to log income (a transformation that acknowledges that a raise of
\$10,000 for someone who earns only \$10,000 has more impact than a
\$10,000 raise for someone who makes \$100,000), you get a straight line
heading continually upward, with more income always producing more life
satisfaction. So an individual or a nation wanting more happiness just
needs to make more money.28 It is not the economy, stupid, and this is a
statistical trick. A replotted straight line does indeed yield no
satiation of well-being by more income. So what? This does not remotely
mean that you should always try to earn more and more money if you want
more and more happiness. MAKING MORE MONEY

Spending that time with your friends or family or in leisure will likely
produce more happiness, once you are well above the safety net, than
will spending that same amount of time making more money. So if you earn
\$100,000 a year now and could boost it to \$120,000 by working for six
more weekends next year, forget it. Your life satisfaction will increase
more if you spend those six weekends with friends and family or on your
hobby. WE NEED NOT more optimism but more realism. Optimism created our
last

major recession, and we need to counter it with a big dose of realistic
pessimism.29 Barbara Ehrenreich has been an unrelenting critic of mine,
beginning with her article "I Hate Hope."30 She places the blame for the
economic downturn in 2007 on positive thinking. Motivational gurus, like
Oprah, Joel Osteen, and Tony Robbins, she tells us, revved the consumers
up into buying more than they could afford to repay. Academics---she
likens me to the Wizard of Oz---provided the scientific props for these
hucksters. What we need, Ehrenreich tells us, is realism, not optimism.
Indeed, cultivating realism, rather than positivity, is her theme song.
The view that optimism caused the economic meltdown of 2007 is pure
twaddle. Rather, optimism causes the stock market to go up, and
pessimism causes it to go down. I am not an economist, but I think
stocks (and derivatives and goods generally) go up in price when people
are optimistic about their future worth and go down when people are
pessimistic about their future worth. Ehrenreich is confused about
reality itself. There are two kinds of reality. One kind is not
reflexive; it is not influenced by what human beings think, desire,
expect, or wish for. What time the sun rises tomorrow, whether there is
adequate laboratory space for your research, and whether there will be a
terrorist attack in Mumbai are all nonreflexive realities. In none of
these do your thoughts and wishes influence what happens. These are
Ehrenreich realities. The other kind of reality, reflexive reality, is
influenced and sometimes even determined by people's expectations and
perceptions. How bright the teacher thinks a student is influences how
she does in class. How much our mates think we love them influences how
well we get along with them. Perception and expectation strongly
influence market price, an eminently reflexive reality: how much you are
willing to

pay reflects more than a judgment of the real value of stock; you are
also judging the market's perception of the future value of the stock.
When investors are optimistic about the market's perception of the
stock's future value, its price goes up. When investors are very
pessimistic about the market's perception of the future value of a
stock, its price melts down. So, a footless optimism among buyers who
believed the real estate market would go up forever surely contributed
to the meltdown. In general, however, optimism causes stocks to rise;
pessimism causes them to fall. A viral pessimism, just as unrealistic as
the footless optimism it displaced, then contributed massively to the
economic meltdown. So I believe that both the viral pessimism and the
underlying nonreflexive reality of financially unsound subprime mortgage
loans contributed to the meltdown. To attribute the meltdown to optimism
is pure Ehrenreich fantasy. Something more insidious than economics
really lies behind Ehrenreich's exhortation for more reality. Ehrenreich
wants a world with no psychological influences, in which human
well-being follows only from class, war, and money, not from beliefs and
expectations. By definition, then, she needs to ignore the enormous
number of reflexive realities in which a person's thoughts and feelings
influence the future. My life's work is entirely about such reflexive
realities, and so Ehrenreich has found in me the right bête noire.
POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY IS Pollyannaism rewarmed. It ignores suffering and

misery and all the bad stuff in the world. This is a straw man, lobbed
by writers who have not read beyond the name "positive psychology" and
have certainly not read the 1913 bestseller Pollyanna. I and many of the
practitioners and scientists in positive psychology came right out of
work on misery and suffering. I devoted thirty-five years of my life to
undoing depression and helplessness. I found that merely getting rid of
the bad stuff was not enough, and so I advocated working on what makes
life worth living as well. Positive psychology complements, but does not
displace, working to rid the world of what cripples life. I CANNOT BRING
myself to list all the accusations that the trolls of the

internet have clubbed me with. Here's one sample, to give you a flavor

of what gets my teeth grinding: one person after numerous nasty blog
posts about me and positive psychology, sent me an email with the
subject line "An Olive Branch." His olive branch: "I will refrain from
accusing you of plagiarism if you will help me get elected president of
the APA Division of Humanistic Psychology." IT IS MUCH better to be
criticized than to be ignored, and the fact that

critics are legion tells me that positive psychology is genuinely
popular. A search for "positive psychology" brings up more than 1
million results on Google. My free Authentic Happiness site
(www.authentichappiness.org) has registered almost 5 million people.
Many hundreds of college courses teach positive psychology (including
the once most popular course at Harvard). Almost every major newspaper
and magazine in English has featured positive psychology. Thousands of
researchers and practitioners call themselves "positive psychologists."
There are thousands of refereed journal articles on positive psychology
and more than two hundred books, several of them bestsellers, translated
into many languages. My books alone have been translated into almost
fifty. The topic has garnered at least \$200 million in grants and
contracts. There are more than twenty national and regional positive
psychology organizations31 and a several-thousand-member International
Positive Psychology Association. I unblushingly identify myself as a
positive psychologist. Why is positive psychology popular? Why now? One
explanation is that the world is better, much better, than it used to
be. The world is much wealthier than fifty years ago. Even the poor
nations have seen more than 1 billion people lifted out of poverty.
Prosperity, of course, moves us to aim for more than just alleviating
misery---we aim toward what is good in life. Public health, modern
medicine, and the green revolution surely mean there is per capita less
physical suffering today than ever before on this planet. In fact, you
have to be blinded by ideology not to see that almost everything we care
about (except mental health) is better now: less pollution, more
democracy, more human rights, less violence,32 longer life expectancy,
lower child mortality, more music, more education, tastier food,
healthier bodies, and more poetry. We may already be in the epoch of
positive-sum-games that Robert Wright envisions in Nonzero.33 Human
progress, while undeniable---

unless you happen to be a professor of cultural anthropology or
literature at a major American, British, or French university---is
nevertheless fragile. There are forces that, if they prevail, would undo
progress and unleash apocalypse on the human race. Or worldwide
depression might occur. Or nuclear catastrophe. Or unknown unknowns. But
if the trend ongoing since World War II continues, we need a psychology
that is conscious of, measures, and builds well-being. A psychology of
misery no longer suffices for the human future. A final reason for the
popularity of positive psychology is gender. Psychology, when I first
encountered it more than fifty years ago, was male. Only 20 percent of
graduate students then were women. The hot topics, not surprisingly
after two world wars and a great depression, were typically masculine:
conflict, dominance, competition, stress, authoritarianism, and the
like. The popularity of agency and control, of learned helplessness
itself, had a male feel to it. It did not occur to the stress theorists
of the time that the reaction to bad events might be not only fight or
flight but also, as Shelley Taylor "discovered," tend and befriend.34
The gender percentages are now flip-flopped, and almost 80 percent of
graduate students are female. The subject matter is also feminized:
cooperation, positive emotion, engagement, trust, relationships, and
love. Positive psychology is likely a major beneficiary of the gender
revolution in psychology.

Chapter Twenty-Three

Positive Education (1990--)

"IN TWO WORDS or fewer, what do you most want for your children?"
Anthony Seldon asked the assembled gathering at the Lawrenceville School
in New Jersey. "Happiness, meaning, contentment, fulfillment, joy,
health, enthusiasm, courage, stick-to-it-iveness," we called out, the
words cascading over each other. The occasion was a June 2007 meeting of
teachers from around the world, and our theme was how to build
"nonintellectual" strengths---meaning, engagement, optimism, positive
emotion---into schools. Anthony was headmaster at the prestigious
Wellington School in the United Kingdom, a biographer of John Major and
Tony Blair, and a historian of the Tory Party. He had launched a
well-publicized program in his school, one that heavily featured
meditation, and he was a spell-binding orator. "Now in two words or
fewer, what do schools teach?" he asked us. "Discipline, numeracy, hard
work, science, literacy, conformity." The words seeped out with
embarrassed hesitation. "Notice," he said, "there is no overlap between
the two lists. Now imagine that well-being, joy, meaning, fulfillment,
engagement... the whole first list could be taught without compromising
the traditional goals of school, the achievement list." Anthony had
defined a new kind of education, and I thought its name must be
"positive education." This is its history. In the 1990s, Susan
Nolen-Hoeksema, Joan Girgus, and I tested whether pessimism predisposed
young schoolchildren to depression, just as it predisposed adults. It
sure did.1 The belief that personal, permanent, and pervasive factors
caused bad events robustly predicted depression

and poor school achievement over the following year among eight- to
eleven-year-olds. Pessimism is a risk factor for depression in
schoolchildren in exactly the same sense that smoking is a risk factor
for lung cancer, and, actually, pessimism is considerably bigger as a
risk factor. We thought prevention, not therapy, was a better strategy
to deal with depression. Parking an ambulance at the bottom of a cliff
to help those who fall off is a much worse strategy than preventing the
fall in the first place. Could we teach children at risk for depression
to argue against unrealistic pessimistic thoughts, just as cognitive
therapy teaches adults already in therapy to become more optimistic?
Would this prevent depression? This question led us to develop the first
Penn Prevention Program for children, and this was the moment, in the
winter of 1990, when positive education began. Jane Gillham, having
completed her postdoc at the Yale Child Study Center after a PhD with
me, Lisa Jaycox, just finishing her PhD with me, and Karen Reivich
devised a twelve-week, two-hour-per-week prevention program for middle
school students. They wrote a minute-byminute manual, and we screened
two hundred fifth and sixth graders to find the seventy kids most at
risk for depression.2 We then followed the kids for two years into
puberty---when the epidemic of depression first takes hold. Before the
program started, 25 percent of the kids in both the prevention group and
the untreated control group had moderate to severe depressive symptoms.
By the end of the program, twelve weeks later, the prevention group had
dropped to 13 percent, but the control group stayed at 23 percent. Two
years later only 22 percent of the prevention group had moderate to
severe symptoms, but a whopping 44 percent of the control group did.
This was a 100 percent effect. The principal cause was a change from
pessimism to optimism in the prevention group, and this was exactly what
we taught the kids. The key to learning optimism is learning how to
recognize and then dispute unrealistic catastrophic thoughts. In Learned
Optimism I described how we taught adults to do this. With children we
used the same principles but with cartoons and comedy and snacks. Here
the child takes a dire permanent explanation ("They are always picking
on me"), which leads to lasting sadness, and he improvises a contrasting
explanation ("They are in a mean mood because they just lost their

baseball game"), which leads to only transient sadness. We also taught
social skills, such as negotiation, and how to take another kid's
perspective. My graduate students and staff were great teachers of how
to teach optimism to children, but there were not enough of us to go
around, so we began to train schoolteachers and measured how well they
did at preventing depression. Based on the amount of depression
prevented and the amount of optimism learned by their students, teachers
did as well as we did. By 2016, twenty years down the road, the Penn
Prevention Program had been replicated many times across the globe, with
rich kids, poor kids, white kids, black kids, and Asian kids in English,
German, Dutch, and Chinese. The prevention of depression, as well as
anxiety, was reliable but "small" to "moderate" in size; in one
meta-analysis, no significant findings appeared.3 The Penn Prevention
Program taught resilience and was the forerunner of positive education,
but it predated positive psychology, whose tools were not available
until after 2002. Disputing catastrophic thoughts is a major tool of
psychotherapy-as-usual---getting rid of negatives to good effect. But it
is not directly about building positive emotion or engagement or good
relationships or meaning or achievement. Positive education---it was not
yet named---would aim to build these directly. OUR EXPLORATION OF
noncognitive factors in school received a giant

boost with the arrival of Angela Duckworth. Angela joined as a
first-year Penn graduate student in September 2002. She had been an
urban schoolteacher, McKinsey consultant, NGO head, and Marshall Fellow
at Oxford. She had an unfashionable take on why some talented kids do
badly in school, and others, less talented, shine: character.
Conventional wisdom and political correctness had for almost a century
blamed the teachers, the schools, the classroom size, the textbooks, the
funding, the politicians, and the parents for students'
failure---faulting anything or anyone but the students themselves. What?
Blame the victim. Blame the character of the students? Angela bit into
this as soon as she entered Penn. The element of character that
fascinated her was self-discipline. Her subjects were the students of
Masterman High School, the magnet school in downtown Philadelphia.
Masterman accepted promising students beginning in the

fifth grade, but many of them washed out, and the real competition began
in the ninth grade. Angela wanted to find out how self-discipline
compared with IQ in predicting who would make it. She created a new
composite measure of self-discipline, gave it to all kids, and found
that self-disciplined eighth graders went on to earn higher grades,
score higher on achievement tests, spend more time on their homework,
start it earlier, and watch less television. Self-discipline
out-predicted IQ by about a factor of two.4 This attracted the notice of
two prominent American headmasters from schools at opposite ends of the
economic spectrum. One was David Levin, head of the Knowledge Is Power
Program, the KIPP schools, a charter organization with more than 180
schools. These college preparatory schools, made up of poor black and
Hispanic kids, had an impressive record of success: 8,000 college
alumni. Their motto was "Work hard, be nice." David's partner was
Dominic Randolph, the British-educated headmaster of the elite Riverdale
School in northern Manhattan. Together they wanted to bring positive
psychology into their schools and specifically programs of character
education. They visited us at Penn, and we began a fruitful
collaboration. We focused on creating the "right-hand side" of the
report card, measuring the character strengths of zest, self-control,
optimism, gratitude, and social intelligence. Angela caught fire and was
launched on a glittering career measuring self-discipline and its
extreme cousin, grit: never giving up. As I write, Angela's first book,
Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance, is in its twenty-fifth week
on the New York Times best-seller list, and she is now a major player in
positive education and beyond.

MANDY AND I helicoptered from a tiny float in the middle of the Yarra

River in Melbourne to the front lawn of Trent Barry's sprawling house.
Trent was an advisor to the Geelong Grammar School (GGS), one of the two
leading private schools in Australia. Trent phoned me during my
Australian speaking tour in February 2006 and asked if I might detour to
GGS. The school was at the climax of a \$16 million campaign to build a
well-being center, and a few remarks by me to the donors, Trent thought,
would raise the last \$2 million. Not shy these Aussies, I thought.
"Imagine positive education," I intoned, thinking of Anthony Seldon, as
I concluded my speech to the donors. There---I had finally given voice
to my vision of schoolchildren who experience pleasure, engagement, good
relationships, and meaning and are also high achievers---and I had named
the movement. The \$2 million was raised that very day, and the
principal donor,

Helen Hanbury (Rupert Murdoch's big sister), told GGS, "Not another gym.
I want well-being for the children!" A few months later, in response to
Mrs. Hanbury's death-bed request, GGS sent a delegation to the Penn
Positive Psychology Center and asked Karen Reivich and me how, if we had
carte blanche, Penn would create positive education at GGS. We also were
not shy and told them we would • train all the two hundred teachers and
the staff in positive psychology, strengths, and resilience; • arrange
visiting lectures from the major figures in world positive psychology; •
appoint a full-time director of positive education; • have a curriculum
designer lead the faculty in creating a K--12 syllabus in positive
psychology. They agreed on the spot to all of these. "And by the way," I
added, "Mandy and I and my kids will come and live at GGS." So on a
baking summer day in January 2007, Mandy, the kids---with Carly and
Jenny, we now had five---and I arrived at GGS (where air conditioning
was a rarity). Darryl, in tenth grade, and Nikki, in eleventh grade,
boarded at the school. Karen Reivich and fifteen of my applied positive
psychology master's students arrived the same day to begin a two-week
positive education training of the faculty and staff, more than one
hundred of whom had, without pay, given up two weeks of their precious
summer vacation to attend. The first day began inauspiciously. The new
headmaster, Stephen Meek, was the very model of a British headmaster:
chilly, stiff as a broom, skeptical, and barely welcoming. I couldn't
blame him: the previous headmaster, Nicholas Sampson, now off to head
Marlborough in the United Kingdom, had imposed positive education on his
successor. Stephen inherited this burden and its serious expense. The
rest of the ten days went swimmingly, however: the teachers learned
about resilience, then about strengths, and finally about social skills.
First they learned to use these skills in their own lives, and then we
covered how to teach them to kids. The big effect was the rejuvenation
of the teachers, and I

saw it in Stephen Meek. By the end of the workshop, he was glowing, all
smiles, hugging people, and effusively asking them about their signature
strengths. Years later, his wife, Christine, confided to me that I had
changed Stephen's life. The Seligmans had a smashing sabbatical. We
lived in the chaplain's house in the middle of campus, and because Nikki
and Darryl were boarders, we had a constant stream of student visitors
sampling better food, air conditioning, and family life. Darryl became a
rugger, and we motored with his team all over the state of Victoria.
Nikki broke the strict GGS rules the very first weekend but was
forgiven. Ray Fowler, Barb Fredrickson, Roy Baumeister, Diane Tice,
Kathleen Vohs, Kate Hays, Stephen Post, and a stream of distinguished
positive psychologists paid long visits. The faculty, under the
supervision of Randy Ernst, a Golden Apple high school teacher from
Kansas City, devised the first K--12 positive education curriculum. When
we finally departed in June 2007, Geelong Grammar School had become the
foremost bastion of positive education in the world.5 Since then, its
faculty, under a full-time director of positive education, has taught
positive psychology to teachers from all over Australia, and the
University of Melbourne now gives a master's degree in positive
education. IN THE MEDIEVAL monastery, the abbot bridged the sacred and
the secular,

sorting out the monks as well as dealing with the crass interests of the
state. Sir Richard Layard, a modern abbot, was a world-class economist,
professor at the London School of Economics, major theorist of
happiness, and Labour Party leader; he and his wife, Mollie, were one of
only two couples who by dint of merit were in the House of Lords. For
the last two decades, Richard had made it his job to take promising
ideas from psychology and persuade the British body politic to act on
them. With David Clark, professor at Oxford, he coaxed Parliament to
allocate more than £1 billion to train thousands of new cognitive
therapists to treat depression.6 "I am going to take the Penn Prevention
Program to the schools of the UK," Richard declared as we walked the
back streets of Glasgow on a break from a meeting in which we shared the
podium. "That would be great, Richard. I think we may have enough data
to try a small pilot replication in Liverpool." "You don't get it, do
you, Marty," said Richard in his affable way.

"Like most academics you believe that government adopts policy when the
scientific data mount and mount to an irresistible point. In all my
years in politics, I have never seen such a case. Government acts when
the data are sufficient and the political will is there. Your data are
sufficient, and the political will is here, and I am going to take your
prevention program to the schools of the UK." He began to raise funding
for training programs for UK teachers, and these were launched in twenty
schools in South Tyneside and Manchester in 2007. By this writing
thousands of British teachers have been trained and have gone on to
teach resilience to tens of thousands of kids. One most heartening
development in positive education came from India. Steve Leventhal had
made the mission of his foundation, CorStone, the teaching of the very
poorest of girls from the slums of India. His group taught positive
psychology to 30,000 "untouchable" girls in the state of Bihar and found
improved emotional resilience, health knowledge, attitudes toward gender
equality, and use of clean water.7

Hector Escamilla, president of Tecmilenio University in Monterrey,
Mexico, decided to embrace positive education for the entire university.
He founded a well-being institute and a well-being ecosystem, and all of
the more than 53,000 students on thirty campuses throughout Mexico took
courses in positive psychology. And Sir Anthony Seldon, now the vice
chancellor of the University of Buckingham, declared it the first
happiness university in Britain. THE PREMIER OF South Australia appoints
the thinker in residence of

Adelaide. The program was designed to bring innovation to the state and,
in the case of my appointment, to raise the well-being of all South
Australians. Their well-being was already pretty high, and Adelaide was
perennially ranked as one of the most livable cities in the world.
"Nothing really bad has ever happened to Adelaide," the lord mayor told
me, "no typhoon, no terrorism, no serial killer, no drought, no

bankruptcy, and no epidemic. We are the only large city in the world so
blessed. We have the usual urban problems, of course, some poverty, some
crime, some racial tension, some unemployment, but except for the really
hot summer, Adelaide is a Garden of Eden." We were given a house at the
very center of the Garden, the former headmaster's quarters at Saint
Peter's College,8 where we lived among 1,200 boys. Our two youngest
daughters, Carly (seven) and Jenny (four), were the only young females
on campus, and they knew it. The house, surrounded by a greensward of
cricket pitches, was adjacent to a huge botanical garden. We were at
home here for the three Februaries between 2012 and 2014. Saint's was
the other top private school in Australia. Between them, GGS and Saint's
had graduated many of Australia's prime ministers and Nobel laureates.
Simon Murray, the energetic headmaster, and Mathew White, the director
of well-being and positive education, had brought me there to help
reinvent an already great school around positive education. They
recruited Karen Reivich and the Penn team to teach the teachers,
sponsored a star-studded lecture series still ongoing six years later,
infused a language of strengths rather than pathology among the students
and teachers, and introduced David Cooperrider's Appreciative Inquiry9
as a vehicle of school-wide communication. Simon Murray founded Positive
Education Schools of Australia (PESA), an association now comprising
more than two hundred schools.10 Simon was committed to spreading
positive education to the state schools, and teachers and principals
from throughout South Australia were trained at Saint's. The premier,
Jay Weatherill, decided to measure well-being regularly throughout the
entire state, and his administration introduced positive psychology
interventions into the mental health services and the hospitals.11 "ALL
OF THEM, Alejandro,

every last one?" I asked Alejandro Braun Adler, my most promising senior
undergraduate. For his honors thesis, he worked on the psychological
well-being of Asian refugees in South Philadelphia. He was from Mexico
City, and his future would be international. He wanted to steer the
world toward greater well-being and was a born diplomat. So for his PhD
he applied to doctoral programs in political science---and only
political science. Despite a sterling record, including the award for
the best senior thesis in psychology at Penn,

every program rejected him. Interlopers from psychology unwelcome, I
assumed; too much overspecialization, not like the 1960s when Penn
Psychology eagerly accepted me straight from receiving a philosophy
undergraduate degree. The interlopers do the creative work, and as an
inveterate---usually unwelcome---interloper, I was on Alejandro's side.
"You're a born psychologist, Alejandro." Too laissez-faire, as usual, I
regretted not pushing him harder to apply for a psychology doctorate.
"Would you consider applying late for a PhD in psychology here?" He was
desperate and gratefully agreed. I phoned our director of graduate
studies, who reminded me that the deadline had passed, and the entering
class for 2011 was set. I had only asked the powers that be to consider
a candidate belatedly once before, and that was for Angela Duckworth, a
decade earlier. Angela worked out splendidly and was now a chaired
professor in our department, the first directly inbred one since I was
hired forty years before---and I'd had to absent myself at Cornell and
in Penn Psychiatry before Penn Psychology would consider me. After a
tussle over tuition dollars (the director insisted that I put skin in
the game and have my grants pay his tuition), Alejandro got in.

Alejandro Braun Adler. To round out the most massive dissertation I have
ever supervised, Alejandro found in Bhutan, Mexico, and Peru that his
well-being curriculum increased both well-being and academic performance
as measured fifteen months later. Photo courtesy of Alejandro Adler.

"I want to expand positive education internationally," I told Alejandro
after giving him the good news. "This may fit your ambitions." Alejandro
went off to Bhutan in 2011, beginning a graduate career in which he
spent almost as much time on airplanes as at Penn. Bhutan, a small
Himalayan country, was especially well suited to our first nationwide
positive education program. The fourth king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, had
declared in 1972, "Gross national happiness is more important than gross
national product." This idea drives public policy, and the Bhutanese
Ministry of Education defines its mission as educating for gross
national happiness (GNH). The ministry invited us to codevelop a GNH
curriculum, and Alejandro led the project. The curriculum for grades
seven through twelve was fifteen months in duration and targeted ten
life skills:

1. Mindfulness: having calm awareness of thoughts, emotions, and
surroundings 2. Empathy: identifying what others are feeling and
thinking 3. Self-awareness: understanding one's own strengths, talents,
limitations, and goals 4. Coping with emotions: identifying,
understanding, and managing emotions 5. Communication: being active and
constructive with others 6. Interpersonal relationships: interacting
healthily and lovingly with friends and family 7. Creative thinking:
developing novel and useful ideas 8. Critical thinking: analyzing,
applying, synthesizing, and evaluating information as a guide to beliefs
and actions 9. Decision making: choosing the best beliefs or action
plans from available options 10. Problem solving: learning shortcuts to
solve theoretical and practical problems OUR STUDY INVOLVED eighteen

entire schools. Eleven schools (5,347 students) were treatment schools,
and seven schools (3,138 students) were the controls. We told the
principals and teachers in both groups of schools that we were training
them to teach the GNH curriculum. The students in both groups of schools
received the same number of classroom hours during the real and placebo
fifteen-month life-skills course: two hours per week. All principals and
teachers in the eleven treatment schools received training during a
ten-day GNH curriculum retreat. The trainers were psychologists from my
center plus nine staff members from Bhutan's Ministry of Education; a
training manual (Educating for GNH) was used. The trainers taught the
principals and teachers how to practice the skills in their own lives
and how to teach the ten life skills to their students. Teachers learned
to infuse their academic subjects (e.g., math, science, and reading)
with the ten life skills. Literature instruction, for instance, employed
a "GNH lens" to identify strengths and virtues in characters from
novels, which students were then encouraged to use in their daily lives.
The principals and teachers from the schools in the control group
received training during a four-day placebo GNH curriculum retreat
during which they learned about how to

teach nutrition, psychology, and human anatomy. We measured students'
well-being and national standardized exam scores at the end of the
fifteen-month course and then twelve months later. Well-being rose and
was significantly higher in the treated schools than in the placebo
schools. Most importantly, academic achievement--- as measured by the
national exams---rose and remained much higher in the treated schools.
We also found that student engagement and perseverance accounted for
most of the superiority of the treatment.12 Bhutan adopted this
curriculum for all the schools in the nation. was his home country of
Mexico. The governor of the state of Jalisco initiated a constellation
of programs to build well-being, and the Ministry of Education partnered
with us to conduct a random-assignment, placebo-controlled study of
positive education. We had seventy schools with a total of 68,762
students. Alejandro and the ministry modified the Bhutan curriculum for
Mexico. It comprised the parallel ten elements from Bhutan. Our staff,
using an extensive training manual, taught thirty-five Mexican trainers,
each with a background in psychology and education, how to teach
teachers these life skills and how to infuse them into their academic
courses. These thirty-five trainers went on to teach the principals and
teachers of thirty-five schools, chosen at random. The same trainers
taught the principals and teachers about nutrition, psychology, and
human anatomy in thirty-five control schools. Fifteen months later the
children from the well-being schools had higher well-being and
significantly higher standardized test scores than those in the placebo
schools. Again, greater engagement and perseverance seemed to have
caused the improved grades. The academic effect was somewhat smaller
than in Bhutan, likely because there was now an additional layer of
training between our experienced trainers and the actual teachers.13 To
round out the most massive dissertation I have ever supervised,
Alejandro, in partnership with the World Bank, then did Peru---this time
with 694 schools and 694,153 students. The design mirrored that in
Mexico and Bhutan, and the curriculum paralleled Mexico's. There was,
however, one more layer to dilute the training. Our Penn trainers taught
28 Peruvian trainers, who then taught 590 local trainers, who in turn
trained the principals and teachers from the 694 schools. ALEJANDRO'S
NEXT TARGET

The curriculum increased both well-being and academic performance, as
measured fifteen months later. Engagement and perseverance of the
students once again mediated, and with yet another layer of dilution,
the effect on academic performance, while highly significant, was
smaller.14 CHANGING THE EDUCATIONAL system of the world is daunting.
Teachers

and principals are heavily invested in what they already teach, and
unions entrench policies that make transformation nearly impossible. The
main objection that Alejandro and I heard time and again was that
schools were about creating paths to college and the workplace. Any
program that taught well-being to schoolchildren had to replace some
useful program already in place. The school day had only so many hours,
and money was insufficient to support what already existed. Making kids
happier might therefore subtract from traditional academic success.
Alejandro's data showed convincingly that young people with higher
well-being actually did better in their academic courses. They became
more engaged in school and grittier in their schoolwork. I believe the
students did so because teaching positive psychology rejuvenated the
teachers themselves and made them easier for the students to engage.
From my point of view, improvement in grades is a welcome byproduct of
positive education. But regardless of its influence on success, more
well-being is every young person's birthright, and we now know that it
can and should be taught. I believe that much of the future of positive
psychology will rest on the fulcrum of positive education.

Chapter Twenty-Four

CIA (2002)

The Navy formed a high-powered medical team. In particular, it invited
Professor Seligman to Guantánamo. This practitioner is a celebrity,
renowned for his works on depression. His books on optimism and
confidence are international bestsellers. It was he who oversaw the
experiments on human guinea pigs.... U.S. torturers, under Professor
Seligman's supervision, experimented and perfected every single coercive
technique. THIERRY MEYSSAN, "THE SECRET BEHIND GUANTÁNAMO,"
VOLTAIRENET.ORG, 2010.

"HOW DOES IT feel to be the spiritual father of American torture?" the
anonymous email read. It was a crisp late-summer day in 2015, and I was
with Mandy and the kids at the Philadelphia Art Museum. How did it feel?
It felt like I had been punched in the gut, and I crumpled onto a bench.
Unlike the wildly false quote that begins this chapter, this email hurt.
I would never aid or abet torture. I believe my very purpose in being
alive is to increase the amount of well-being in the world, and I have
worked my whole life to decrease helplessness in the world. So as I got
up from the bench, clutching my gut, I decided that I would devote a
chapter of this book to narrating what actually happened. I had made it
a practice to try never to get defensive when my science was criticized,
since science advances by criticism. But this criticism was not about my
science; it was personal and moral, as well as untrue, and so this will
be the only chapter that will feel defensive to my readers.

Here in a nutshell is what happened: in the spring of 2002, James
Mitchell, Bruce Jessen, and Kirk Hubbard of the CIA asked me how the
research on learned helplessness could help captured Americans resist
and evade torture and interrogation. They never asked about how to use
learned helplessness with detainees and never mentioned the
interrogation of detainees. Mitchell and Jessen later created an
enhanced interrogation program, and it was falsely reported that they
based some of its brutal techniques on the theory of learned
helplessness. I played no role at all in these developments, and I am
grieved and horrified that brutal interrogations might employ scientific
research conducted to relieve helplessness and depression. NOW THE
DETAILED history.

My reaction to 9/11 was typical of most Americans'. It was the first
frontal attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor, and I worried that
it was the opening shot of full-scale war. What could I do to help my
country? I had no high government or military contacts; nor did I know
much about Islam or terrorism. I did, however, have good convening power
among academics. I called my friend and donor Jim Hovey and asked if he
would underwrite my convening a group of academics to make
recommendations to the White House about how to counter Islamic
extremism. Jim agreed readily. So a group of twelve professors met at my
house on December 15 and 16, 2001. Four people from the American
intelligence community also showed up. I did not invite them, and I do
not know who did. We wanted to send the White House unsolicited
recommendations to help the nation in a time of great need. Our topic
was how to win a lasting victory against global terrorism. I made no
recommendations myself: I served as secretary and compiled the
recommendations of the other invitees. We probably sent them to the
White House, but I never received any response from the government about
this meeting or the report. The four intelligence people introduced
themselves (Steven Band and Steven Etter from the FBI and Kirk Hubbard
and James Mitchell from the CIA), but they were totally silent
throughout. I did not have a conversation that I can recall with any of
them---except during one break James Mitchell told me, quite gushingly,
in a thirty-second conversation how much he admired my work. He did not
elaborate. His remark was striking, and I proudly told Mandy about it
that night.

There was not a single mention of interrogation, torture, or detainees
during the meeting. The most unrelenting of my critics call this meeting
the "misty origin" of the torture program and my complicity in it.1 But
there is no basis for this other than my being in the same room with
James Mitchell and Kirk Hubbard for two days. In 2008 Jane Mayer, a New
Yorker writer, made the first allegations that I had aided torture.
Professor Seligman's disavowal actually adds a rather interesting new
fact to the story of how the psychology profession played a role in the
CIA's "special" interrogation program. In "The Dark Side," I established
by interviewing him, that he had personally spoken for three hours at
the Navy's SERE School in San Diego, in April of 2002, at a somewhat
mysterious confab organized in part by the head of Behavioral Science at
the CIA. ... Seligman, it seems, agreed to participate in what he says
was an unexplained private high-level CIA meeting, held on the campus of
the part of the Navy that runs a secret program emulating torture....
Professor Seligman says he has no idea why he was called in from his
academic position in Pennsylvania, to suddenly appear at this CIA event.
He just showed up and talked for three hours about how dogs, when
exposed to horrible treatment, give up all hope, and become compliant.
Why the CIA wanted to know about this at this point, he says he never
asked. But somehow---and this is what is news as far as I know...
Professor Seligman does know that in his audience were the two
psychologists who soon after became the key advisers to the CIA's
"enhanced" interrogation program: James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen. So,
Professor Seligman, must have had some contact with them, since he knew
they were in his audience. Did he speak with them? What did they talk
about? ... So did Seligman assist the U.S. Torture program? I am careful
not to say so in "The Dark Side,"---I just recount the facts of his odd
visit to the SERE school.2 As far as I am concerned, Mayer does not
"recount the facts" and her claim of an "interview" with me is a
half-truth. We had an email

exchange in December 2007, a few months before publication of her book
The Dark Side.3 I emailed her several paragraphs on December 21, 2007,
and also said, "I can try to answer your email queries." She emailed
back, "I'll send a few questions your way shortly. I have a lunch
appointment in a moment, but when I get back I'll send off an email.
Again, thank you for any help on this." She never wrote me again, and so
we never had a substantial interview. I have a complete record of our
correspondence (I have been careful to do all my interviews about these
matters in writing so there would be a public record if needed). Her
statement "Professor Seligman says he has no idea why he was called in
from his academic position in Pennsylvania, to suddenly appear at this
CIA event" is absolutely not supported by the facts. Here are the facts
of my dealings with the CIA in 2002 and thereafter. In mid-February
2002, Bruce Jessen, on behalf of the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency
(JPRA), invited me to give a talk at the annual conference of the
Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) community. He sent along
a collection of papers on how our troops were trained to resist
interrogation and survive captivity. He asked to meet with me in April
to discuss the contents of the talk and signed the letter as "Senior DoD
SERE Psychologist." Two meetings then took place at my house. I have a
clear memory of the first but no memory of the second. Kirk Hubbard and
a female lawyer (whose name I do not remember) came to my house, and we
had a roughly two-hour conversation. They asked me at length about
learned helplessness (procedures, generalization, time course,
immunization, biology, and therapy). I went through all this material in
detail with them. They told me that they were interested in how what was
known about helplessness might help Americans when captured to resist
and evade torture and interrogation. They suggested that I make this the
topic of my speech to JPRA at the San Diego Naval Base in mid-May. The
next meeting likely occurred later in April 2002. I have had to turn to
others to document that it actually happened. The meeting was at my
house with Kirk Hubbard, James Mitchell, and Bruce Jessen. I have
wracked my brain for almost a decade trying to conjure up any memory at
all of this meeting, but with no success. Nor do I have any record of it
in my date books. Of all the events I report in this chapter, this is
the only one that I do not remember. So for its existence and the
account of

what happened at the meeting, I have to rely on external sources. Greg
Bloche, a professor of law at Georgetown, interviewed a CIA source who
confirmed the existence of such a meeting "sometime in the spring of
2002," and the source said that I had a "classic approachavoidance
conflict regarding helping \[them\]."4 I think the source was Kirk
Hubbard, since he also affirmed the existence of this meeting to David
Hoffman for the Hoffman Report to the American Psychological Association
(APA).5 The APA Board of Directors commissioned the Hoffman Report in
2015 as an "independent investigation" into APA's role in the enhanced
interrogation program. David Hoffman asked me by email in 2015 about the
existence of such a meeting in preparing his report. Here is what I
emailed him: I continued to be puzzled about the visit with Hubbard,
Mitchell and Jessen in April 2002, since I have no memory of it. So I
wrote Kirk Hubbard and sent him all my recent correspondence with you,
asking him to comment on its accuracy in toto. Here's his response: "I
reviewed your responses to David Hoffman. And I am pleased that I am not
the only person whose memory isn't as clear as I would wish! I believe
all of your responses are accurate except for a couple of things. There
was a second meeting at your home on April 3, 2002 with Mitchell, Jessen
and myself attending. The purpose was to ask you to discuss Positive
Psychology at an upcoming JPRA conference in May 2002, to which you
agreed. As you note there has never been any discussion with you
regarding any aspect of interrogation that I am aware of. \[Underlining
is mine\] And I verified that with Jim Mitchell. Second, I did give you
a glass vase on April 3, 2002. It was probably worth under \$50.00 and,
since I paid for it, it was a personal gift from me not the CIA." So I
surmise from this that there must have been such a meeting and such a
gift, since I cannot think of any reason why Hubbard would make this up.
Most important to me, Hubbard (and through him, Mitchell) both confirmed
that "there has never been any discussion with you regarding any aspect
of interrogation." Despite my having no memory of the meeting, I believe
it occurred because (1) Bruce Jessen asked me to meet with him on that
date; (2)

Hubbard and Mitchell told Hoffman that there was such a meeting and I
can't think of any reason they would lie; and (3) I can remember meeting
Mitchell only twice and Jessen only twice: Mitchell at my house in
December 2001 and also presumably in April 2002, and Jessen at the JPRA
meeting on May 17, 2002, and also presumably at my house in April 2002.
(Neither Mitchell nor Jessen was present at the first meeting at my home
in early 2002, and I do not think Mitchell was at the JPRA meeting.)
Jeffrey Kaye, a psychologist and anti-torture activist, sees my failure
to remember this meeting as evidence of a cover-up.6 It would be
exculpating and convenient for me to remember this meeting and its
contents, but the simple truth is that I do not. So what was said at
this meeting? I assume, but I cannot be certain, that I went through
exactly the same material about the research literature on learned
helplessness as I did with Kirk Hubbard and the lawyer and as I also did
subsequently at the JPRA meeting in May. On those other occasions I
outlined the procedures for inducing helplessness in the laboratory, the
generalization to other laboratory settings, when it is temporary and
when it is permanent, how to immunize against it, its neurobiology, and
how to do therapy to cure it. I am certain that they did not mention
detainees, interrogation of detainees, or using learned helplessness on
our prisoners. Had they mentioned any of these at any time, alarm bells
would have sounded, I would surely have remembered it, and the meeting
would have stood out in my memory. Hubbard and Mitchell testified to
Hoffman, "There has never been any discussion with you regarding any
aspect of interrogation." My conversations with Hubbard and the lawyer
in April and at the JPRA meeting were entirely about how the knowledge
of learned helplessness could help captured American personnel and not
about using learned helplessness on detainees. My motivation was
entirely to help captive Americans. Here is what the Hoffman Report
concluded about my role: Combining the statements made to us by
Seligman, Hubbard, and Mitchell, it appears that Hubbard met with
Seligman at his house on two occasions---once along with Mitchell and
Jessen, and once along with two other CIA psychologists or attorneys. At
these

meetings, learned helplessness was discussed (in substantial detail
during at least one of the meetings), and Seligman was invited to speak
to a SERE conference in San Diego about learned helplessness. Our
evidence shows that Mitchell was very interested in the application of
the learned helplessness theory to interrogations of uncooperative
detainees. Hubbard and Mitchell say that they never discussed
interrogations with Seligman and did not provide him information about
the interrogation program. Seligman agrees and says he thought their
interest in learned helplessness related to its insights for captured US
personnel who are trained through the SERE program to resist providing
information in interrogations.7 On May 17, 2002, I gave the promised
three-hour lecture at the San Diego Naval Base to an audience of about
one hundred people, presumably from the Department of Defense (DoD). I
spoke in detail about the scientific literature on learned helplessness
and how captured American troops and American personnel might use what
was known to resist torture and evade interrogation by their captors. I
was surprised to learn that I was barred from all sessions except mine,
since I had no security clearance. My speech in San Diego was pro bono,
but JPRA reimbursed me for my airfare and hotel. Kirk Hubbard was in the
audience, as, I believe, was Bruce Jessen. I do not remember seeing
James Mitchell there. Hubbard and I and the same lawyer who visited my
house had an outdoor lunch at the Hotel Coronado before my speech. Our
conversation concerned what learned helplessness tells us about how
captured American personnel could resist and evade torture and
interrogation. There was no mention of detainees. IN 2016 TAMSIN SHAW
wrote a hostile article about me in the New York

Review of Books. She said, "The extent of Seligman's further involvement
has not been established, but in an e-mail sent by Hubbard in 2004, he
expressed gratitude for Seligman's help 'over the past four years.'"8
Was I involved with the CIA after my speech on May 17, 2002? This
question first arose when James Risen, a well-known New York

Times reporter, was writing Pay Any Price,9 the book that gave rise to
APA's commissioning the Hoffman Report. Risen asked me about the
gratitude to me expressed by Kirk Hubbard in an email to Scott Gerwehr.
Here is my email exchange with Risen from December 12, 2012: Hi,
Mr. Seligman. I am finally finishing up my book that I contacted you
about last year. I am doing a chapter about interrogation policy and the
mental health professions, and as part of that I've looked into the life
of a Rand researcher named Scott Gerwehr who I think you may have known.
He died in 2008, and I have obtained many of the emails that he wrote or
received while he worked on deception detection research, often on
contracts for the CIA and other government agencies. The emails are
mostly of interest to me not because of anything Gerwehr did, but
because they seem to provide a glimpse into a network of behavioral
science professionals who were in and out of the intelligence community
during the Bush years. Some of the emails relate to you, and one in
particular, caught my eye. It was an email Kirk Hubbard of the CIA wrote
to Gerwehr and other people in March, 2004. In it, he wrote that "My
office director would not even reimburse me for circa \$100 bucks for
CIA logo t-shirts and ball caps for Marty Seligman's five kids! He's
helped out a lot over the past four years so I thought that was the
least I could do. But no, has to come out of my own pocket! And people
wonder why I am so cynical!" This is a fairly pedestrian email, but I
would like to ask you about Hubbard's suggestion that you had been
helping the CIA for the previous few years. I was particularly struck by
this since you had previously told me that you had nothing to do with
the CIA's interrogation program. So I was wondering if you were working
with the agency on other matters. I emailed Risen the same day. Here's
the text: I do not have any memory of Mr. Gerwehr. I got no hat or
T-shirts for my kids, nor any other token of gratitude from the CIA. The
only thing Kirk Hubbard might be referring to was my lecture in May 2002
in San Diego (which was sponsored by SERE, not as

far as I know by the CIA). I had lunch with Hubbard, at the Coronado I
think. It was friendly and I told him at length about my work on learned
helplessness, in the context of our soldiers and diplomats resisting
captivity. Or perhaps he is referring to the meeting at my house in
December 2001 (which had nothing to do with interrogation---but with how
our global policies could counter Islamic Jihad). He was there as well.
All of our conversation was friendly. You might ask Hubbard what he was
referring to. I did no work for the CIA during the Bush era, not on
interrogations, not on anything else. Maybe this is naive, but can't you
just ask the CIA to verify this? I emailed Kirk Hubbard the next day and
asked him to verify for Risen what is above. Hubbard emailed me back on
December 14, 2012. Here's the text: Yes, the below does conform with my
memory. I did not purchase any hats or t-shirts for your children
because I was disgusted that the office director would not reimburse me
and I was, sadly, too cheap to pay for them myself. The SERE conference
in San Diego was not sponsored in any way by the CIA. And I can verify
that you were never on contract to do work for the CIA. So the reason
that, as Shaw comments, "the extent of Seligman's further involvement
has not been established" is that there wasn't any. I had no other
substantive interactions with Hubbard, Mitchell, Jessen, the female
lawyer, the CIA, or any related agency after the May 17, 2002, JPRA
meeting in San Diego. IT WAS SAID that Mitchell and Jessen based their
"enhanced interrogation"

program on learned helplessness. Mitchell denied this, and in a December
9, 2016, email to me, referring to his book Enhanced Interrogation,10 he
said, "For the first time the CIA is allowing me to say that I did not
base my approach on learned helplessness." In my view learned
helplessness is not relevant to what the program did. As described in
the press,11 enhanced interrogation involved beatings, sleep
deprivation, waterboarding, and a host of cruel techniques. This is old-

fashioned brutality, and its effects are not the same thing as learned
helplessness. Learned helplessness is about bad (or good) events that
continue regardless of what you do; its defining feature is that nothing
you do matters. The bad events continue regardless of your actions. In
contrast, the implicit bargain in such interrogation is that if the
prisoners tell the truth, the brutality will stop, and this is exactly
the bargain that Mitchell described in his book. Further---and I qualify
what follows by saying that I have never seen an interrogation; nor do I
know the literature on interrogation---I think that the goal of
interrogation is to get at the truth. The interrogator and the subject
have a bargain: if the subject tells the truth, he will get better
treatment (or a reduced sentence or better food or more sleep). Learned
helplessness rests on the belief that nothing the subject does matters
at all ---it does not matter if he tells the truth, or lies, or is
silent, or says what the interrogator wants to hear. So using enhanced
interrogation to produce learned helplessness would make no sense. That
outcome would totally undermine the bargain by making the prisoner
believe that it did not matter whether he told the truth. It would make
the prisoner more passive and depressed, but it would not lead to
disclosure. The irrelevance of learned helplessness aside, Tamsin Shaw
suggested that I should have foreseen that the CIA would use my
information about learned helplessness for ill purposes. Martin Seligman
has repeatedly insisted that he is an opponent of torture. He tells us
in his letter that he "strongly disapproves" of it. If he found himself
at the very center of the terrible episode in our recent history in
which the United States inflicted brutal torture on detainees in the Abu
Ghraib prison, the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, and at CIA black
sites, this was, he maintains, entirely unwittingly. And yet, since he
was at the center of this episode, being in direct contact with the
architects of the CIA's torture program at the moment of its devising,
there are some clear questions that a declared opponent of torture might
have asked in his position.12 That I was "at the very center of this
terrible episode" is pure Shaw fantasy. As far as I can see, I was not
even marginally involved. But what of the "clear questions" that I, as
an opponent of torture, should have

asked Mitchell or Jessen? JPRA and the CIA approached me in early 2002
to ask what I knew about learned helplessness in order to help train our
soldiers and diplomats to resist torture and interrogation when
captured. The entire discussion was about helping Americans. Detainees
were never mentioned. Interrogating---to say nothing of
torturing---detainees was never mentioned. Needless to say, I wish no
wars ever had to be fought and that the brutal business of war and the
horrible torture that sometimes accompanies it never happened. But since
the world is still a dangerous place, we have to deal with the awful
reality that our soldiers might be tortured. That does not mean that I
believe we should torture our enemies. I most emphatically don't---for
reasons both moral and practical. I am, however, a patriotic American,
eager to help my country in a time of great need, and I took the
questions Mitchell or Jessen asked at face value. Why should I not have?
Shaw wants me to have foreseen that these people might use my
information to brutally interrogate and torture detainees. I am not
particularly naive, but this did not occur to me. Nor, do I think, would
it have occurred to anyone without 20/20 hindsight coupled with a
conspiracy theory about the Department of Defense. Shaw sees my failure
to confront the CIA and refuse them help in early 2002 as a moral
failure. She believes that psychologists should better foresee how what
they say and what they write might be misused. The irony of her
accusation leads to my concluding remarks. I have been puzzled about the
unrelenting attack on my actions and my character that these events
unleashed. Despite repeated investigations and a mass of evidence that I
was not complicit, the theory that I helped to design and carry out a
program of torture continues. Nothing found counts as disconfirmation in
the eyes of the attackers. Here's why I surmise that the attacks
continue nevertheless. I was asked right after 9/11 to help captured
American soldiers evade and resist torture---which I gladly did,
foreseeing that the likely consequence would be less suffering by our
soldiers. But an organized cadre of antiwar activists did not want to
look properly at the facts or my motives. In the hands of Tamsin Shaw,
Jeffrey Kaye, Roy Eidelson, Bryant Welch, Steven Soldz, Steven Reisner,
Jean Maria Arrigo, and their Coalition for an Ethical Psychology, this
presented a capital opportunity to accuse a prominent scientist (and
former APA president)

of aiding and abetting the torture of detainees. A smear campaign, guilt
by association, and quarter-truths notwithstanding, I speculate that
they hoped to exploit my case to forward their agenda: undermining
psychologists' willingness to help the US military. While I did not
foresee the possibility that some might use my knowledge in truly awful
ways, I believe that these antiwar activists foresaw one very likely
consequence of their maligning my actions. In the future, when asked by
legitimate government officials to serve the United States of America,
young psychologists will be more likely to refuse lest they be similarly
defamed should their knowledge be misused. This same group of antiwar
psychologists succeeded on a larger scale in 2015. They staged a coup
d'état in an attempt to take over the American Psychological
Association. For the last fifty years, APA has had three overlapping
constituencies. The original and most venerable comprised the
scientists. In the 1970s, the independent therapists overtook the
scientists in numbers, and governance fell to them in the coup d'état
staged by the self-named "dirty dozen." My presidency in 1998 marked a
brief respite and some sharing of power between the practitioners and
the scientists. But there has always been a third, less conspicuous
constituency: the social activists. Indeed, many of the therapists and
scientists share their ideals. I do as well, particularly on race and
gender issues. The agenda of the social activists, broadly speaking, is
"human rights." Psychologists are left of center politically, and
explaining this would itself require a whole chapter. Suffice it to say
that one major factor is the psychologists' laudable task of helping
people in trouble, the downtrodden, people who need advocates and
defenders. So it is no surprise that APA has been conspicuous in
advocacy for, and devoted major resources to, affirmative action,
women's issues, and gay rights. But the social activists, particularly
the far-left, antiwar wing, have always taken a backseat to the
therapists and the scientists and even to the moderate social activists.
All this changed in 2015. James Risen's Pay Any Price accused APA of
complicity in the George W. Bush administration's enhanced interrogation
program. The allegation made the front page of the New York Times. The
New York Times attacking organized psychology---mon dieu! This was the
moment, and attacking APA as a puppet of the Bush administration became
the moral high ground that the antiwar activists

used to orchestrate regime change. They declared an emergency and
demanded an investigation of APA's "collusion" with the Bush
administration. The board of directors, under President Nadine Kaslow
and President-elect Susan McDaniel, acceded. At the cost of \$4.5
million, they hired David Hoffman, a Democratic prosecutor from Chicago,
to carry out an independent investigation. Hoffman regularly consulted
the antiwar activists, but not the accused, and gave them premature
access to the report. In July 2015, "unknown" parties prematurely leaked
the Hoffman Report to the New York Times before those "named" could
defend themselves. Those "named" (I was not one of them) never received
their promised right of response and correction. The Hoffman Report was
interpreted as concluding that APA officials "colluded" with the
Department of Defense to sanction torture and that APA's "currying
favor" was motivated by the desire for DoD contracts and grants. The
governance of APA, along with several past presidents, was condemned.
(To my relief, the testimony of Hubbard and Mitchell, it seemed, had
exculpated me.) Within days, the high administration of APA either
resigned or was fired, and Nadine Kaslow, as president, endorsed the
report and issued an apology to the nation. The actions, policies and
the lack of independence from government influence described in the
Hoffman report represented a failure to live up to our core values. We
profoundly regret, and apologize for, the behavior and the consequences
that ensued. Our members, our profession and our organization expected,
and deserved, better.13 APA promised to clean up its act and take human
rights more seriously. Psychologists were forever banned from
participating in DoD interrogations, regardless of how legitimate the
request or how desperate the national need. I have not been in the APA
loop since 2000, so I have no firsthand knowledge of what actually
happened in Washington, DC. But as a reader of the report and the
firestorm of pros and cons that ensued,14 the takeaway---that APA
"colluded" with DoD to sanction torture, motivated by dollars---looks
flimsy to me. Not flimsy is the fact that APA governance moved toward
the antimilitary left. It is no coincidence that the very same people
who falsely accused me of aiding and abetting

torture and, as we shall see in the next chapter, opposed resilience
training for American soldiers were at the center of the Hoffman
episode. As I write, those "named" have sued APA and Hoffman for
malicious libel.15 The plaintiffs allege that Hoffman, Kaslow, and
McDaniel actively colluded with Stephen Soldz, Steven Reisner, and the
antiwar APA Left and engaged in a malicious and knowingly false smear
campaign. That Hoffman took his lead from the anti-war Left is entirely
plausible given his questions of me---for example, "Describe all other
items of value you received from the government between September 11,
2001 and December 2008. Please include all gifts received from Kirk
Hubbard and/or Jim Mitchell, including any vases and CIA-labeled
paraphernalia." The outcome of the coup, the lawsuit, and who will
control APA's \$100 million budget and lead its 100,000 members is very
much in doubt. One thing is not in doubt. The antiwar activists have
scared the pants off many APA members. Psychologists---scientists,
practitioners, and centrist social activists---have learned that
cooperating with the government, particularly with the Department of
Defense, is dangerous to one's career. Such cooperation invites a smear
campaign from the antiwar activists. Undermining psychologists'
willingness to help the government is, I believe, the basic intention of
this group. We cannot know what the future holds, but, unfashionable as
it is, I strongly believe that when in doubt, we should err on the side
of helping our nation.

Chapter Twenty-Five

Army (2008--2017)

AT EITHER END of the long table sat a brigadier general. Both were
women. In the middle of the table sat a constellation of two- and
threestar generals. They were all men. The four-star chief of staff of
the US Army walked in. Everyone jumped to attention, and I, the only
civilian, stumbled to my feet. General George Casey took the chair in
the middle, across from me. It was December 2008, and the war was raging
in Iraq. President George W. Bush had, with fulsome praise, kicked
General Casey upstairs from the battlefield to the Pentagon, to be
replaced in the field by General David Petraeus. Petraeus's surge seemed
to be taking hold, but mental illness plagued the army itself---hence my
invitation to the Pentagon. "Suicide, drug abuse, posttraumatic stress
disorder, panic, depression, divorce," began General Casey, speaking
deliberately but with an undertone of skepticism. "What does positive
psychology say about all that, Dr. Seligman?" "The human reaction to
awful events like combat, Sir, is bellshaped," I began, reflexively
using the honorific that I learned in the battalion at the Albany
Academy for Boys. "You have just described the left-hand side of the
bell, the different names for the ways in which people's lives are
ruined. But most people are resilient, which means they go through a
tough time in combat and then a few months later, by all our physical
and psychological measures, they are back where they were before combat.
"More important and much less publicized," I continued while focusing my
eyes on a major general without a left leg, "is posttraumatic growth,
the right-hand side of the bell curve. These are the soldiers who go
through a terrible time in combat but one year later are stronger---by

our physical and psychological measures---than they were to begin with.
The army is not a hospital, and of course you should continue to spend
the billions of dollars it takes to help those who have their lives
ruined, but my advice, Sir, is to move the whole curve rightward, toward
posttraumatic growth." "The general staff has done its homework,
Dr. Seligman," General Casey replied. I could see from the books they
were carrying, including my latest, that they were well prepped. "I
intend to create an army that is just as psychologically fit as
physically fit. We have read your work on positive education. We know
that you teach teachers the skills of resilience and positive psychology
and that you have found that young people who learn your material from
their teachers have less depression and more well-being. That's the army
way. We have 40,000 teachers in the army." "You do, Sir?" "The drill
sergeants," he said with finality, and then, unlike you and me, who,
when we have a good idea, try to convince our colleagues, General Casey
now commanded, "I want the drill sergeants taught the skills of
resilience and positive psychology, and the drill sergeants will then
teach the 1.3 million soldiers. From this day forward, resilience and
positive psychology will be taught and measured throughout the entire
United States Army. I intend to create an army that is just as
psychologically fit as physically fit. "To do this I want you to work
with one of the brigadier generals, Dr. Seligman." I glanced at
Brigadier General Loree Sutton, the army's chief psychiatrist, at the
left end of the table. I had heard a bit about her; it was said she was
staging Greek tragedies with traumatized soldiers as her actors, getting
them to open up and pour out their hidden emotions. This was not my kind
of intervention. But General Casey, to my relief, pointed to the right
end of the table. "Dr. Seligman, meet Rhonda Cornum. Rhonda is the chief
urologist of the army, and I want you to work with her to create
'Comprehensive Soldier Fitness.' Report back to me in sixty days." "I
will be delighted to work with a star neurologist, Sir," I answered.
"Urologist," Rhonda corrected, and on this off-note began one of the
farthest-reaching collaborations of my life.

TWO DAYS LATER Rhonda drove her RV up from the Pentagon to my office

at Penn's Positive Psychology Center to plan. At five-foot-two and one
hundred pounds, she was pert, with short-brown hair, and dressed in
unflattering army camouflage. She was laconic and used humor to drive
home her points. "Better is the enemy of the good," she told me when I
suggested too many experts. "He needs some adult supervision," she said
when I recommended a captain. She was also a war hero, the only female
general to hold the Purple Heart, having been wounded in combat. During
Operation Desert Storm she went on a rescue mission. Her helicopter was
shot down, and all the men jumped on her to protect the physician with
their bodies. Unfortunately, the bullets were coming up from below, and
all but Rhonda and one other soldier died. She suffered two broken arms,
a broken finger, a gunshot wound, and other injuries. She was taken
prisoner and sexually molested. Saddam Hussein and President George H.
W. Bush negotiated her release. "It's too bad you're a woman, Major,"
the welcoming colonel told her when she arrived back in Saudi Arabia
from prison, "otherwise you could be a general." A general she became
and---as I discovered somewhat later, seeing how at Fort Leavenworth
1,200 majors and colonels had risen to their feet applauding her---not
just any general but the poster child general. Creating a
psychologically fit army required two things. First we needed a measure
of psychological fitness, not just the usual measures of unfitness:
mental illness, indiscipline, substance abuse, felonies, dishonorable
discharges. We needed good measures of a soldier's wellbeing,
resilience, character strengths, social support, sense of purpose,
growth, and positive emotion---the positive sides of a soldier's life,
since Comprehensive Soldier Fitness (CSF) aimed explicitly to increase
the well-being of all soldiers not just to reduce negatives. Second, we
needed a plan for building well-being and resilience, a plan to move the
entire army toward the right-hand side of the bell curve---toward
posttraumatic growth. For the first, we convened a meeting of measurers
the very next week, right before Christmas 2008, in my office. I came
down with the flu, and they excused me after my opening remarks. Chris
Peterson chaired the meeting along with Colonel Carl Castro. Nansook
Park, Chris Peterson's right hand, was the workhorse. Taking the best
items

from a variety of personality inventories, they constructed a 120-item
Global Assessment Tool (GAT) and started the pilot work right away.
"REPORT," GENERAL CASEY instructed. Same lunch table, same generals---it

was mid-February 2009, and I was jet-lagged, just back from teaching
positive psychology to Geelong Grammar School teachers in Australia. "We
developed a questionnaire to assess soldiers' well-being, resilience,
and character strengths, as well as the usual deficits and problems,"
Rhonda said, "and we piloted it with ten thousand soldiers, Sir." She
actually called 10,000 subjects pilot work. "Good work, General Cornum.
What are you and Marty \[I blushed when General Casey used my first
name\] going to do by way of building resilience and positive psychology
in the army?" "We'd like to run a pilot study with one hundred drill
sergeants and five thousand soldiers," Rhonda said. She and I had
discussed this at length and decided to go slowly and carefully. "Each
sergeant will teach fifty soldiers resilience skills and then for the
next year we will gather data---" "We are at war, General Cornum,"
interrupted General Casey. "I don't want a pilot study. I want you to
teach and measure resilience and positive psychology in the whole army
now." "Move out, Soldier!" he said and left the table. We snapped to our
feet. So Rhonda and I had three huge tasks. The first, creating a viable
test of resilience and well-being for more than 1 million soldiers, was
well underway. The second was to craft an intervention that had a shot,
in the absence of serious pilot work, at building resilience in
soldiers. The third was to measure---in the midst of war---if soldiers
were actually learning more resilience. Karen Reivich now enlisted to
build the intervention. Karen had been teaching resilience and positive
psychology to hundreds of schoolteachers, most recently at the Geelong
Grammar School. The drill sergeants were indeed teachers, but of a very
different stripe. How could we modify the extensive manuals we used to
teach teachers in peacetime to teach drill sergeants in the middle of a
hot war? We needed to combine what we'd learned teaching civilian
teachers with the issues that overwhelmed soldiers in Iraq and
Afghanistan. So Karen mixed two teams together: the first comprised our
five best

teachers of ordinary schoolteachers, and the second consisted of
soldiers, from colonels to corporals, all of whom had served on the
front lines. We had already created massive minute-by-minute manuals for
teaching schoolteachers and modified them to teach drill sergeants. In
an eightday program for schoolteachers we started first by teaching the
teachers to use the skills of resilience and positive psychology in
their own lives and only then taught them how to teach the skills to
schoolchildren. So we planned to first teach the sergeants to use the
skills on themselves and then develop the techniques for teaching the
soldiers. We were surprised by the similarity in the issues faced by
both soldiers and civilians. Before meeting the soldier team to redo the
manuals, we assumed new material would deal primarily with firefights,
roadside bombings, and dealing with hostile as well as innocent
civilians. How can you remain resilient when your best buddy has just
been decapitated? We were soon disabused of this CNN-stereotyped warfare
in Iraq. "This is the first war in which soldiers have cellphones," a
major reminded us. "Before a battle a worried private will call his
girlfriend in Saint Louis, and they will have a huge fight. When we see
suicide attempts or posttraumatic stress, troubles back at home loom as
large as firefights in Iraq." So as we wrote the new manuals for the
drill sergeants, we coupled examples from army life and ordinary home
life. Take for example an exercise to correct catastrophization (the
worst possible interpretation applied to an ambiguous situation) by
transforming it into a more realistic interpretation. The exercise,
called "Put It in Perspective," aimed to lower the panic and anxiety set
off by the worst interpretation of a bad event. Army life: You and your
squad are out on a land navigation course. It is twenty minutes past the
midnight deadline, and one of your soldiers has not shown up. Step one
is to list the worst possibilities: • He's got heat stroke. • He's
probably dead. • It's my fault, and I will rot in jail the rest of my
life.

Step two is to list the best possibilities: • He's taking a nap. • He's
100 meters away and will be here in a few minutes. Step three is to list
the most likely possibilities: • He got lost. • He's hitchhiking back. •
I will have to report him, and the captain will bawl me out. Now develop
a plan for dealing with the most likely outcomes. • Find out who saw him
last. • Send out a couple of guys with a vehicle to look for him. Home
life: You phone you girlfriend late at night in the United States, and
she does not answer. Worst outcome? • She's out on a date with another
man. • She's having an affair. • It's all over. Best outcome? • She's
asleep and does not hear the phone. • She's staying overnight at her
mother's house. Most likely outcome? • She's gone out drinking with her
girlfriends. • She's tempted by other guys. Now formulate a plan for
dealing with the most likely outcomes. • Outline an understanding script
about how lonely you both are. • Rehearse it with your best buddy.

THE MANUAL STARTED with

a panoply of such resilience, or "mental toughness," exercises. This
took up the first two or three days of the program. In the next two
days, the sergeants (20 percent of whom were female) learned to identify
their signature strengths, as well as the strengths of the soldiers in
their platoons, and how to deploy the range of strengths to carry out
actual missions. Finally, we taught "building strong relationships," a
scientifically informed version of inculcating leadership skills. So,
for example, we taught how to impart effective praise. When you
recognized someone and offered praise, we suggested naming the specific
strength, strategy, effort, or skill that had led to the good outcome.
It just takes another sentence. Naming the strength does three things: •
Demonstrates you were really watching • Demonstrates authenticity •
Enables winning streaks We piloted the program successfully with several
hundred drill sergeants, and after months of negotiations, the army and
Penn entered into a \$30 million contract to train thousands of drill
sergeants and other noncommissioned officers over the next three years.
My work was entirely pro bono. Accordingly, once a month about 180 drill
sergeants showed up at the Penn Sheraton Hotel for a nine-day course. As
of this writing, we have trained more than 40,000 trainers. They were
not shy and were more candid critics than our polite, housebroken
schoolteachers. The sergeants were typically black or Hispanic soldiers
originally from tough urban neighborhoods and had done three often
heroic tours of duty in Iraq or Afghanistan. They had seen it all and
were forthright about their opinions. I should say that after going to
faculty meetings for fifty years, I have yet to meet a faculty member I
would trust my life to. In the course of this work, I have now met
dozens of sergeants that I would trust my life to. I will present some
numbers about the effectiveness of this training below, but the
sergeants' reactions were dramatic and more to the point. At the outset
of the first hour, they were leaning away from us with facial

expressions that ranged from stolid indifference to sucking on a lemon.
They were thinking something like, "What is this emasculating
psychobabble that we have been ordered up to Philadelphia to listen to?"
By the end of the first hour, they were leaning forward, intrigued. By
the end of the last day, three-quarters of them had volunteered to
become trainers of trainers, the next level of teaching. Their average
rating of the entire program was about 4.9 out of 5.0, and the modal and
emblematic comment was "This is the single best course I have had in
twenty years in the army." The drill sergeants told us many times that
these skills were "lifesaving," but my guess is that the real effect was
on the home front. One morning I came in very early to the Sheraton and
sat down to breakfast. A master sergeant whom I had met the day before,
when we taught active constructive responding to good events, joined me.
"I couldn't wait to tell you that something really cool happened last
night after class, Sir," he said, barely restraining himself. "I called
home, and my son answered. He was so excited. He hit a home run in
Little League and won the game. We chatted for about five minutes, and
then he said, 'Dad, is this really you?'" These skills are useful on the
battlefield, but they are at least as useful at home with the people you
love. One sergeant told me that taking this course when he was younger
would have saved his marriage. We planned carefully to get good data on
whether the program actually worked, using untreated control groups and
random assignment of sergeants to training or no training. We originally
designed the rollout of the training so that 10,000 soldiers would have
resilience training and 10,000 controls would not, a nice clean
experiment. But the reality of war thwarted us. The sergeants' reception
to this course was so overwhelmingly positive that the generals sped up
the rollout, wiping out our neat control group. So our well-designed
experiment went up in smoke. In the meantime, the army decided to create
a giant electronic database housed in Monterrey, California, and for the
very first time at least thirty siloes of data---formerly separated and
unanalyzable--- millions of soldiers were merged into the Person-Event
Data Environment. This became a national treasure for civilian and
military medical research, and you will hear more about its power for
scientific discovery in the next chapter. In the absence of a controlled
experiment, Major Paul Lester and his team of statisticians in Monterrey
did their

very best to get before- and after-deployment data to see if
resiliencetrained soldiers actually fared better. Looking at soldiers'
psychological status before and after deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan,
they found that the soldiers (n = 6,739) who had resilience training
improved in emotional fitness, active coping, and optimism and
catastrophized less in contrast to the soldiers (n = 3,218) who had no
resilience training and actually dropped in these measures by the end of
their deployments.1 Since these were self-reported data, the army under
Major Lester went on to look at the diagnosis of mental illness.
Significantly fewer soldiers who had resilience training were diagnosed
with posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression, and the
rate of substance abuse was halved.2 Based on these findings the
Department of the Army declared the program "effective" and
institutionalized it throughout the service.3 The program is now
available to the families of soldiers as well as to the soldiers
themselves. At the outset I told the generals that I wanted to migrate
the program to the army and not have the army dependent on me and the
University of Pennsylvania. So each month we picked out the most skilled
sergeants to become trainers of trainers. They then delivered the
resilience training to other sergeants on army bases throughout the
world. By now we have at least five hundred skilled trainers of
trainers, most of whom were sergeants. Given these successes, I was
surprised by the harshness of the criticism the program unleashed. But I
was not surprised by who the critics were. They were the very same
people who accused me of designing the enhanced interrogation program
for the CIA. Here are their criticisms and my responses. IT SHOULD NOT
have been undertaken, or if undertaken, it should have

been done much more slowly. According to R. Eidelson, M. Pilisuk, and S.
Soldz, It is highly unusual for the effectiveness of such a huge and
consequential intervention program not to be convincingly demonstrated
first in carefully conducted, randomized, controlled trials---before
being rolled out under less controlled conditions.

Such preliminary studies are far from a mere formality.4 General Cornum
and I proposed to first do a big pilot study on 5,000 soldiers, but the
chief of staff overruled us. In his view, a pilot study would take
years, and the results would come in too late to help our soldiers in
Iraq and Afghanistan. There were, however, twenty-one replications of
the procedures on middle and high school students.5 In the absence of
any resilience program that met Eidelson, Pilisuk, and Soldz's
requirements, General Casey, we believe, made the wise choice: a program
reasonably likely to work rather than no program at all or one that came
too late.

IT DID NOT work, and it was a waste of money. The Institute of Medicine

report Preventing Psychological Disorders in Service Members and Their
Families6 said, More recently, in another internal non-peer-reviewed
report, The Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness Program Evaluation

Report #4: Evaluation of Resilience Training and Mental and Behavioral
Health Outcomes, Harms et al. (2013) examined psychological health
diagnosis outcomes for 7,230 soldiers who received the GAT before Master
Resiliency Training was initiated (October 2010) and again approximately
6 months later (about April 2011).... Findings revealed... no difference
in diagnosis among those receiving the intervention. This is an
egregious error. Here is what Report Number 4 showed for the diagnosis
of mental disorders in these 7,230 soldiers: 1. In the Master Resilience
Training (MRT) condition, the diagnosis of substance abuse occurred in
1.16 percent of soldiers, whereas in the nontraining condition, the
diagnosis of substance abuse occurred in 2.85 percent of soldiers. MRT
more than halved substance abuse. Projected across 1 million soldiers
(there were 1.1 million soldiers in the army at the time), this would
equate to 11,600 as opposed to 28,500 cases of substance abuse, a
difference of 16,900. If each case cost the army \$20,000 (I am making
this number up, but it is likely a substantial underestimate), MRT would
save the army \$340 million---to say nothing of massively reducing
suffering. 2. In the MRT condition 4.44 percent of soldiers were
diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, panic, or depression. In
the nontraining condition 5.07 percent were so diagnosed. Projected
across 1 million soldiers, 44,400 cases would have occurred with MRT and
50,700 with no MRT, a difference of 6,300 cases. If each case costs the
army \$20,000 (again my made-up number but conservative), MRT would save
the army \$125 million---to say nothing of reducing suffering.
COMPREHENSIVE SOLDIER FITNESS is unethical. R. Eidelson, M. Pilisuk,

and S. Soldz wrote,

No evidence was provided indicating that CSF received preliminary review
by an independent ethics review board. This is particularly disturbing
since the program includes components that are mandatory for all U.S.
soldiers. The discarding of informed consent protections is a serious
violation of the Nuremberg Code established after World War II in
response to the actions of Nazi doctors.7 Here is how the army responded
to congressional staffers about this: According to Army Regulation 70-25
(Use of Volunteers as Subjects of Research, 1990, p. 17), research is
defined as: "A systematic investigation that is designed to develop or
contribute to generalized knowledge. The term does not include
individual or group training of military personnel such as combat
readiness, effectiveness, proficiency, or fitness exercises." As CSF is
a training program that supports and impacts all Soldiers and there is
no expressed intent to create generalized knowledge, the program does
not fit the definition of research. \[Italics mine\] CSF has the same
status as training programs that require all soldiers to do morning
physical training, and to attend classes about how to recognize signs of
suicide and sexual harassment, how to resist when captured, or why to
wear safety belts when driving. These programs do not require informed
consent. CSF HARMS SOLDIERS. According to Eidelson, Pilisuk, and Soldz,

There are, however, other ethically fraught possibilities... "moral
injury"... the challenges and consequences soldiers face in response to
"perpetrating, failing to prevent, bearing witness to, or learning about
acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations."
Resilience training could, for example, harm our soldiers by making them
more likely to engage in combat actions that adversely affect their
psychological health. Missing from CSF is a component devoted to helping
soldiers grapple with the profound ethical dilemmas involved in their
duties, including

killing in furtherance of state policy.8 Similarly, Bruce Levine, a
blogger, ranked CSF number six on his list of the ten worst abuses of
psychiatry and psychology.9 Why? Because it subverted "U.S. Soldiers'
resistance to the military-industrial complex." As the only evidence
that this might be so, he wrote, "In one role-play used in this program,
a sergeant is asked to take his exhausted men on one more difficult
mission, and the sergeant is initially angry and complains that 'it's
not fair'; but in the role play, his 'rehabilitation' involves
reinterpreting the order as a compliment." Here is what the Office of
Comprehensive Soldier Fitness stated in response to congressional
inquiry about these allegations: The authors of the article expressed
concern that CSF training might actually cause harm. Current data
analyses show that there is no evidence that CSF causes harm (Office of
Comprehensive Soldier Fitness, 2011). These critics wanted a program
that would lead soldiers to oppose American foreign policy, to defy
orders, and to avoid combat. CSF does not bear on any of these---one way
or another. Rather the results showed that soldiers who participated in
CSF training 1. Had greater emotional fitness 2. Were more adaptable 3.
Thought in less catastrophic terms when faced with adversity 4. Employed
their core character strengths more often 5. Had better coping skills 6.
Were more optimistic 7. Perceived the Army as being more supportive of
their family's needs. CSF WAS A reward for my assisting the CIA torture
program. Daniel

Tencer wrote, A psychologist whose research was used in constructing the
US's program to torture terrorism suspects has been granted a
\$31million no-bid Army contract to provide "resilience training" to

US soldiers. Mark Benjamin at Salon.com reports that University of
Pennsylvania psychologist Martin Seligman's research "formed the
psychological underpinnings of the Bush administration's torture
program." The Army awarded the "sole source" contract in February to the
University of Pennsylvania for resilience training, or teaching soldiers
to better cope with the psychological strain of multiple combat tours.
The university's Positive Psychology Center, directed by famed
psychologist Martin Seligman, is conducting the resilience training.10
The clear implication is that Comprehensive Soldier Fitness was some
kind of nefarious reward for my allegedly helping construct the enhanced
interrogation program. But I did not assist or abet the interrogation
program, so there could have been no such "reward." Nor was my work on
learned helplessness the basis of the enhanced interrogation program.11
Since helping the US Army make our soldiers more resilient has been one
of the personal and professional high points of my life, I find this
accusation unjust and insulting. Here are the facts. The University of
Pennsylvania received a solesource, no-bid \$31-million contract to
train US Army personnel in resilience and positive psychology. This was
sole-source, no-bid because there existed no other known entities
besides Penn to compete for this contract. The chief of staff of the
army, George Casey, viewed this as very urgent. He was in a rush to get
such a program started to help our troops as soon as possible. I believe
the army decided to sole-source the contract for the following reasons:
• Penn was the only known entity that had done extensive training and
published extensive peer-reviewed research on resilience training. •
Penn was the only known entity that had extensive experience in the
training of trainers in resilience. • The army could identify no other
competing entity. • General Casey wanted the program expedited.

Army procurement and Penn negotiated for many months, and there was
never any mention of past work that I might have done with DoD or
Intelligence (I had not done any such work). The only contract I ever
held with the CIA or any other relevant group was in the early 1980s
analyzing the speeches of world leaders for optimism and pessimism.
Other than this, I have never before or since had a contract with any
intelligence agency or any other relevant public or private agency. I
have never held any security clearance. ALMOST ALL THE criticisms came
from people who opposed American

foreign policy and our military interventions in the Middle East. So I
must say two things in closing this chapter. First, it is malice to
invoke the Nuremberg Code, the Nazi doctors, and ethical violation in
the criticism of CSF. Such allegations, however baseless, have a
chilling effect on those many psychologists who want to help our
soldiers and the government in these trying times. Some will wonder,
Might I get accused of ethical violations? and so be deterred from
service. I want to encourage scientists and mental health practitioners
to come to the aid of our government, and I urge them not to let this
tactic deter them. Second, these critics accuse me of "blind
patriotism." My patriotism is not at all blind: I view the United States
as the country that gave my relatives, persecuted unto death in Europe,
a sanctuary where their children and grandchildren would flourish. I
view the US Army as the force that stood between me and the Nazi gas
chambers, and thus I count my days with the sergeants and the generals
as the most fulfilling of my life.

Chapter Twenty-Six

Physical Health (2007--2017)

MY SEARCH FOR protective factors against physical illness began in 2007
when Paul Tarini visited me. Paul ran the Pioneer Portfolio of the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the leading private funder of American
medical research. "The foundation likes what you've done with mental
health, Dr. Seligman. You argued---with lots of data---that mental
health is more than just the absence of mental illness; it is the
presence of positive emotion, meaning and engagement. What is physical
health?" Paul asked me rhetorically. "Is it just the absence of physical
illness, or is it the presence of some real thing? We would like you to
create a field of positive health, a field that will explore protective
factors." I welcomed this job and needed at least two shining lights to
attempt it. I knew one already: Chris Peterson. I snagged him into
reanalyzing existing studies, probing for protective factors---over and
above risk factors. For the other person, I wanted the world's leading
cardiovascular epidemiologist, since heart disease seemed a prime area
to look for protective psychological factors. "Who is the world's
leading cardiovascular epidemiologist?" I asked Jim Marks, the executive
vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. "That would be
Darwin Labarthe," he said without hesitation. Darwin Labarthe! I had
lost track of Darwin, the founder of Wilson Lodge and hero of my
Princeton days. I had never met him then, just worshipped from afar.
Darwin's life's work, it turned out, had been the eradication of heart
disease, and he believed that prevention---the earlier the better---was
the way to do it. Cardiovascular medicine had reduced death risk from
heart attack and stroke in America by almost half in my

lifetime, and Darwin's mission was to reduce it to zero. He believed in
"primordial prevention," positive health from gestation on. I asked
Darwin to join positive health, and he consented eagerly, quite
appreciative of my praise for what he did at Princeton fifty years
before. A circle was completed in my life. We laid out our mission
statement: Positive Health empirically identifies health assets by
determining factors that predict health and illness over and above
conventional risk factors. Biological health assets might include, for
example, high heart rate variability, high levels of HDL, and
cardiorespiratory fitness. Subjective health assets might include
positive emotions, life satisfaction, hope, optimism, and a sense of
meaning and purpose. Functional health assets might include close
friends and family members; a stable marriage; meaningful work;
participation in a social community; and the ability to carry out work,
family, and social roles. Health assets are desirable in their own
right, but research has clearly demonstrated the relevance of biological
assets and suggested the importance of functional health assets to
overall health. Still to be determined is whether and how subjective
health assets contribute to health-related outcomes, including: •
Longevity • Morbidity • Quality-adjusted life years • Prognosis when
illness strikes • Health care utilization and cost1 Chris, along with
Laura Kubzansky, a young professor of public health at Harvard, Eric
Kim, and Julie Boehm, led the analysis for subjective health assets.
There existed many well-executed long-term studies of heart disease, but
they were heavily biased toward the negative, measuring---almost
exclusively---risk factors: depression, divorce, unemployment, anxiety,
hostility, and the like. They failed to measure the good things in life.
But here and there snippets yielded clues to positive protection.

Six studies fit our criteria of good science with some minimal measures
of positive factors, and we analyzed these closely. Our reanalyses found
that all of these revealed heretofore hidden protective factors. The
Whitehall II Cohort found2 that optimism and emotional vitality were
both associated with a modest but consistently reduced risk of incident
coronary heart disease (CHD). It also found that protection was evident
for satisfaction in job, family, sex life, and self, but not for love,
leisure, or standard of living. We reanalyzed the Normative Aging Study
and found that high selfregulation reduced the risk of nonfatal
myocardial infarction and CHD death compared to lower levels. We
reanalyzed the Health and Retirement Study and found that higher
optimism predicted a 10 percent lower incidence of stroke in a two-year
follow-up of 6,044 adults. Optimism stayed significant even after fully
adjusting for demographic, behavioral, biological, and psychological
stroke risk factors. We reanalyzed other variables from the Health and
Retirement Study and found that purpose in life predicted 21 percent
lower risk of subsequent heart attack among 1,546 participants with
cardiovascular disease two years later, controlling for psychological
and biological risk factors. This was the beginning. Optimism emerged so
frequently as a protective factor for CHD in the reanalyses that Laura
Kubzansky and Julie Boehm went on to review all the major studies of
optimism and heart disease and published a landmark Psychological
Bulletin paper.3 The twenty or so such studies painted a consistent and
compelling picture of pessimism as a huge risk factor for, and optimism
as a huge protective factor against, cardiovascular disease. Here is
just one representative and well-done study: the Women's Health
Initiative. It followed 97,000 women, healthy at the outset, for eight
years. As usual in careful epidemiological studies, it measured age,
race, education, religious attendance, health, body mass, alcohol
consumption, smoking, blood pressure, and cholesterol at the start.
Optimism was measured by the well-validated Life Orientation Test,4
which asked ten straightforward questions, such as "In unclear times, I
usually expect the best," and "If something can go wrong for me, it
will." Importantly, depressive symptoms were also held constant, since

pessimism might stem from depression. The most optimistic quarter had 30
percent fewer coronary deaths than the bottom quarter. The trend of
fewer deaths, both cardiac and all-cause deaths, held across the entire
continuum of optimism, indicating that optimism protects and pessimism
hurts. This was true holding all the other risk factors---including
depressive symptoms---constant.5 We knew that optimists smoked less, had
less depression, and were happier than pessimists, but these studies
showed that optimism mattered over and above all of these factors in
preventing heart disease. By what mind-body mechanism did optimism
matter so much for heart disease and not so much---if at all---for
cancer or even infectious illness? Here's my best guess. In the next
chapter, I introduce the idea of prospection, the ubiquitous mental
activity of envisioning future scenarios about our lives. You are likely
doing just this right now, taking this very sentence and projecting its
possible use into your marriage, your teaching, or your health, since
prospecting is an ineluctable hallmark of human thinking. Optimism,
unlike the momentary high spirits of hedonic happiness, is a trait, a
mental disposition to prospect positive scenarios about the future, and
pessimism is a disposition to prospect negative futures. These scenarios
occupy us many hours every day. Just as strong external events are
accompanied by cardiovascular consequences, so likely are prospections.
Anxiety-inducing real events and anger-inducing real events and
sadness-inducing real events all result in pronounced sympathetic
activity and difficulty relaxing, states that injure the heart in the
long run. Pleasant, relaxing, victorious real events result in
parasympathetic activity and good vagal tone, states that are good for
the heart. The same holds for vividly imagined future events: the
pessimist, just sitting at her desk, is roiling in anger, anxiety, and
sadness-inducing prospection and suffering its injurious cardiac
effects, while the optimist is basking in positive futures and their
healthy cardiac effects. Done every day for a whole lifetime, this adds
up. If this is how optimism helps and pessimism hurts the heart, a very
cost-effective intervention follows. Just change pessimism into optimism
in cardiovascular patients, as the Penn Resiliency Program did with
soldiers and kids and as Tayyab Rashid did in positive psychotherapy.
Indeed, one recent Iranian study did this.6 Reza Nikrahan and his bold
colleagues gave sixty-nine coronary patients six weeks of positive

psychology interventions and followed them for fifteen weeks, looking at
coronary biomarkers: they found better cortisol response, a sign of
heart health, than in the controls. No one has ever done this with the
prevention of death as the outcome. Given the size of optimism's
protective effects (they are rather larger than those of not smoking),
their consistency (every single study shows that optimism protects), and
how readily pessimism can be turned toward optimism, I've been
advocating a major study of training optimism to prevent cardiovascular
disease and death. I still have not gotten past first base, and positive
health's inability to penetrate conventional medical thinking and its
journals is the single most frustrating obstacle in my scientific
career. Our journal rejection rate from the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation project at the prestigious medical outlets has been close to
80 percent, and I see a double standard in action. Studies that show
positive psychological protective factors get rejected out of hand, but
those that deny positive protection get accepted and publicized. Here's
a recent example from the Lancet, a highly prestigious journal that has
rejected every one of our submissions outright. A very substantial
literature makes a compelling case that happy people live longer7 and
that happiness influences longevity. Literally scores of meticulous
studies in psychology journals document this, and there are almost no
exceptions. In 2016 the Lancet trumpeted its article "Happiness and
Unhappiness Have No Direct Effect on Mortality."8 The investigators
reported that among 719,671 British women, of whom 31,531 died over a
ten-year follow-up, self-reported unhappiness failed to predict who
would die---once self-reported poor health was removed statistically.
Self-reported poor health predicts death, the article concluded;
unhappiness does not. Oh, my God, I thought when reporters called me for
comment. Could all the previous scores of studies have been wrong?
No. The Lancet study, for all its "1 million women," was very poorly
done, and looking at it as disinterestedly as I can, I am sure no
rigorous psychology journal would have accepted it. The authors asked
only one unhappiness question in a 316-item survey. It was the 306th
item, following hundreds of questions about medications, diet, and ill
health (400,000 women quit before reaching this item). The women were
fiftynine years old on average when they answered the unhappiness
question

and the current poor health questions. There is excellent reason to
believe that unhappiness would influence the reporting of poor health at
age fifty-nine and that a lifetime of unhappiness, by the
well-documented mechanisms of unhappiness producing worse sleep, less
exercise, more smoking, and fewer friends, in the first fifty-nine years
of life would strongly cause self-reported and actual poor health at age
fifty-nine. A trio of distinguished psychologists published a damning
critique, which concluded, "We believe what the authors of the Lancet
study found was not whether happiness is related to longevity but this:
Whether a oneitem happiness question will predict a shortened life in
healthy middleaged women, if you delete how happiness has affected their
health for their first six decades and if you erase the influence of key
pathways to health such as social support, smoking and body mass
index."9 So I here want to complain publicly about the leading medical
journals. Psychologists are unwelcome interlopers in the world of
medical science. Medicine is dominated by the belief that psychological
factors do not cause medical outcomes or only do so by way of biological
processes---even if the psychological factors are known and measured and
the biological factors are completely unknown. This creates an
extraordinary double standard. Studies showing that unhappiness and
pessimism cause death---and even more, studies showing that happiness
and optimism prevent death---in our experience face almost insuperable
obstacles to publication in the best medical journals. Sloppier studies
that deny psychological causation are readily published. Someday we will
discover the unknown biological correlates of happiness, optimism, and
vitality and how they impinge on the body. In the next chapter I put a
promising candidate forward. For now, however, we presently know how to
measure---and most importantly, how to change---these causal
psychological states for the better. There should be widespread programs
to raise the optimism, happiness, and vitality of medical
patients---right now. The double standard in the medical literature, I
believe, squelches this, at a cost of millions of lives a year. AS OF
2011 we had been extracting and reanalyzing the few positive,

protective items from the existing literature on risk factors. We
correlated them to cardiovascular disease, and the protective factors
were

surprisingly predictive. But now a new question emerged: Wouldn't it be
much better if there existed a longitudinal study of hundreds of
thousands of healthy people that measured health and illness as well as
the panoply of protective factors? Out of the blue, the US Army decided
to create just this. It consolidated its personnel and medical records
into one huge system, the Person-Event Data Environment (PDE). This was
a big step forward for the Department of Defense (DoD) since there had
existed at least thirty separate siloes of data, almost inaccessible to
one another. The different siloes included all the medical records,
promotions, suicides, crimes, medal awards, wounds, annual evaluations,
commendations, instances of family violence, and much more, but they did
not talk to one another. The Global Assessment Tool (GAT) that Chris
Peterson and Carl Castro developed in 2009 was in one of the siloes and
contained data on psychological protective factors, such as strengths
and well-being, as well as psychological risk factors, such as
catastrophization, for more than 1 million soldiers. If we could access
the PDE, we would no longer need to scavenge through old studies to find
out, for example, if soldiers with a strong sense of meaning recovered
from surgery faster, controlling for the severity of the injury. Or if
soldiers who catastrophized tended to get posttraumatic stress disorder,
controlling for depression and intensity of combat.10 We could define
the "optimally healthy soldier" by asking how optimal health comes about
and how to maintain it. This---and so much more---lay in the PDE,
waiting for scientists to analyze. We seized the moment. The army, Penn,
and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation all saw the PDE as a national
treasure, an unparalleled resource for answering medical and scientific
questions never answerable before. The foundation called a meeting at
its Princeton headquarters and the surgeon general of the army
helicoptered in. Rhonda Cornum, Darwin Labarthe, and I drove. So the
Positive Psychology Center, the US Army, and the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation launched a new project to harvest the low-hanging fruit in
the PDE and then to create an infrastructure so that civilian and
military scientists could ask the great questions of the PDE. This
launch gave us a lot to celebrate and much to discuss, and so we
scheduled a steering committee meeting for October 9--10, 2012. Soon
after we got our big news, tragedy struck. On October 9th, Chris
Peterson died suddenly, likely of a heart attack, while sitting on his

balcony having a last cigarette before leaving for the meeting. LINDA
NEWSTED, my secretary, rushed into my office. She was weeping.

"They just found Chris on his balcony. He's dddd... he's not alive." I
had just lost my dear friend and my closest colleague. He knew me very
well, perhaps better than anyone, except Mandy. But strangely, I never
knew him. I never knew his sexuality or even that he smoked. I was
without words for the next few weeks. I lapsed into stunned silence
during my eulogy at the positive psychology summit three weeks later,
and my students had to cover for me. In the obit that Nansook and I
jointly wrote, we said, "Other people matter. Period," said Chris
Peterson when asked for a concise definition of "Positive Psychology,"
the field he helped to found and then helped to guide through the first
decade of the 21st Century. He researched, taught, and lived positive
psychology.... Within hours of his death a cascade of hundreds of
remembrances filled the ether and their main theme was how and why Chris
was so loved. He left giant footprints not only in positive psychology,
but also in the lives of so many people that he touched through his
life.... He loved people. He walked the positive psychology walk. He was
genuinely interested in getting to know others. He made everyone around
him feel comfortable and respected. He was an understated, humble, and
generous person. It was no accident that his Michigan nickname was
"Mother Theresa." He always found joy in letting other people shine and
sharing the credit with others. He had a gift for seeing the best in
each person. He also had a strong sense of fairness and duty without
being rigid. He did not allow his personal feelings to obscure his
judgment. He always had fun whatever he did, and also brought fun for
others. Although his scholarly contributions are significant, his
lasting legacy will be what he shared with other people. So many of us
are indebted to him for being better researchers, better teachers and
better people. Other people mattered to Chris, and he to others.11

Now five years after Chris's death, the words of G. H. Hardy12 ring true
for me: I still say to myself when I am depressed, and find myself
forced to listen to pompous and tiresome people, "Well, I have done one
thing you could never have done, and that is to have collaborated with
both Littlewood and Ramanujan on something like equal terms." Indeed the
best days of my life were spent collaborating with Christopher Peterson
on something like equal terms. POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY SUFFERED a second
crushing blow in December

2012. Ray Fowler, my friend and my only mentor in my adulthood, had
      stepped down as CEO of the American Psychology Association (APA)
      after fifteen years. He had turned APA around, and its finances
      and membership had never been in better shape. It was a
      160,000-member body with a surplus of \$100 million. He now turned
      his energy to positive health and had a special mission. In my
      opinion, positive psychology is the invention of pointy-headed,
      unathletic, middle-aged men, and it is almost entirely neck-up.
      But so much of what makes life worth living is neck-down:

It is a freezing December night in Washington, and I have just attended
a very long and tedious board of directors meeting. I am invited by the
younger set to watch amateur tango dancing in an unheated barn. The
dancers are amazing, and I am transfixed by their beauty and grace.
Hours pass. At two in the morning, a gorgeous female who moves like a
panther asks me to dance. "I only do words," I say declining. Ray
decided to make neck-down positive psychology his cause. He added
exercise to psychological protective factors and changed my life with an
hour-long speech at Geelong Grammar School in 2008. He

lectured on the evidence for 10,000 steps per day creating
cardiovascular fitness. The lecture itself was a bit tedious, what with
all that data, but the next day many of us went into town and bought
pedometers. I have walked 10,000 steps per day almost every day since
then. (Oops, only 7,124 so far today.) Having been through the APA wars,
Ray became our senior political advisor when we founded the
International Positive Psychology Association, and he was on the
steering committee of my Robert Wood Johnson Foundation positive health
grants. His project was to add positive psychology and positive health
to the medical school curriculum, and he created a new curriculum for
physicians. More than anything Ray was determined to make it to one
hundred. He made us all read Blue Zones,13 Dan Buettner's intriguing
study of places where lots of people live to be centenarians. He was in
great physical shape, the perennial winner of the over-sixty APA
marathon. He modestly said he won because the competition thinned out
every year. At Akumal, besides walking and running us off our feet, he
was always the first one into the ocean for a very long swim and
snorkel. We tagged along like goslings. Mandy and I were about to fly to
San Diego for Ray's eighty-second birthday in 2012, when his wife Sandy
told us that he had suffered a massive stroke. Partly paralyzed like my
father, Ray never really spoke again. I tried to talk with him on the
phone, but to no avail, and as with my father, I was too phobic to visit
him. Ray died in 2015, nursed faithfully by Sandy and surrounded by his
large, loving family until the very end. Here is what I wrote to the
listserv Friends of Positive Psychology: Ray Fowler's death is a
grievous loss to Psychology, to Positive Psychology, and to me
personally. Ray was the long-serving CEO of the American Psychological
Association, recruited when he was President, in a successful attempt to
rescue APA from desperate financial and political troubles. He said his
greatest virtue was that he suffered fools gladly (I know I was one of
them). After he retired as CEO, then in his seventies, he found a new
career in Positive Psychology. His main interest was the psychological
benefits of exercise. He pedometerized all of his friends and walked and
ran us off our feet until we flourished or dropped. He encouraged me to
run for APA president. He

exhorted me to become a transformational rather than a transactional
leader, and he held my hand in the creation of Positive Psychology as a
discipline. He was a cherished mentor and he was my good friend. Chris
and Ray, both personality theorists, would have loved what happened next
in positive health, and I mourn not being able to tell them about it.
Positive Psychology Marries Big Data

Google Zeitgeist 2010, a meeting of the top Google people and their
richest clients---Motorola, Time-Warner, Zappos---was held in an upscale
adobe hotel in Paradise Valley, Arizona. There was a lot of margarita
drinking and loud music, and the people were astonishingly young. An
elder, I was out of my element, but I was a keynote speaker. My address
followed that of an unremittingly pessimistic economist who predicted
worldwide economic collapse and a dire future. In contrast I decried
self-fulfilling pessimism and predicted continuing, if balky, human
progress. But I was really there because I had a big idea, and I wanted
to roadtest it with Google Earth. I hoped to measure the well-being of
the world cheaply and in real time. I have used questionnaires all my
life, but warily. Questionnaires suck when it comes to getting at what I
really want to know. I want to know, for example, how much meaning you
have in your life. But the only tool I've had until recently is to ask
straight out, on a scale of one to ten, "How much meaning do you have in
life?" with one being "none" and ten being "full of meaning." I can ask
the same question in different ways (e.g., "How much purpose do you have
in life?") to bolster "reliability," but the problem of validity---is
what you say true?--- remains. Here are just a few of the problems of
questionnaires: • You might lie. • You might detect what hypothesis I am
pushing (e.g., depressed people have little meaning, particularly if the
meaning question

follows a depression inventory), and you might then go out of your way
to confirm or disconfirm it. • You might "reputation manage." • You
might just not answer and leave. This happens all too often. • You might
not understand what "having meaning in life" means. • The questionnaire
puts its words into your mouth as opposed to using the words you
spontaneously use. All this is even worse if I want to know your
"personality." Are you an extrovert? So I ask, "Do you like to go to
parties?" and "Do you start conversations with strangers?" These
questions are subject to all the problems above, yet are alleged to be
the "ground truth" of personality. The jargon for these problems is that
questionnaires are "reactive" and "intrusive" as opposed to spontaneous
and unobtrusive. There is a better way to get closer to ground truth:
what is actually going through your head, the words and phrases you say
to yourself all day long. The new social media throw open a picture
window on those words and phrases---at last a better way in. "How happy
are people in the Bay Area? Are people in San Francisco happier than
people in Berkeley?" I asked one of the head programmers for Google
Earth over a Dr. Pepper. "I haven't the slightest idea," he said. "Let's
find out," I said, whipping out a list of about twenty happiness words
that I got from my thesaurus: happy, joy, cheerful, content, smile,
glad, sunny, and so on. "Could you use the Google search engine and
pinpoint the frequency of the happy words by location?" "I was up half
the night," he told me the next morning as he handed me a colored-in map
of the Bay Area, "and here are the data. The red areas use the most
'happy' words and the blue areas the fewest." We showed Larry Page,
Google's laconic CEO, these results, and he blessed the endeavor. My
collaboration with Google was short-lived, however, because the company
insisted on using its search engine rather than extracting words from
Gmail. When people use a search engine to look up "happy" or "love,"
however, unlike when they search for "cough" or "flu," it is usually
because they don't have happiness or love, not because they do. I then
went full blast after Big Data as a better way of measuring

psychological states and traits. First I brought Lyle Ungar on board.
Lyle was a professor of computer science and math prodigy, and unlike
many of his colleagues, he also understood and even liked psychology---
especially positivity, which he exuded. He viewed the "meaning" of a
word not by obsolete necessary and sufficient conditions (a bachelor is
defined as an unmarried man). Rather he asked how a word was actually
used in the social media. He combed through millions of tweets and
looked for the words that actually co-occur with "bachelor," up to five
words on either side. To my mind, Lyle had brilliantly quantified Ludwig
Wittgenstein's revolutionary insight that the meaning of a word is its
use in the language.14 Lyle was eager to collaborate and brimming over
with insights about how to mine Big Data to measure well-being and
personality. We recruited Andrew Schwartz, a dyed-in-the-wool
computational linguist, as a postdoc to manage the project, and we
landed Johannes Eichstaedt. Johannes was a phenomenon, a young polymath.
When not climbing the Himalayas or meditating, he did physics, math,
linguistics, neuroscience, and psychology. He took his master's in
applied positive psychology with me in 2011, finishing at the top of the
class, and was admitted as a PhD student to the Penn psychology
department. Led by Andy Schwartz, the team applied to the Templeton
Religion Trust for a grant to map the well-being of the world and in
2014 received \$3.8 million to do this. The data poured in, and they
convinced me that we had opened a new world of psychological
measurement, one that would complement and possibly replace
questionnaires. Take a look. The figure just below shows a word cloud
derived from the Facebook statuses of 40,000 women. The larger the word,
the more it distinguished women from men.

The next figure shows the word cloud for 40,000 men.

Yes, my dear, this is what he was actually thinking. Merely looking
blindly at Facebook or Twitter, we were right about the gender of the
author 92 percent of the time. When I first saw the gender word clouds,
I staggered and had to sit down. I felt like I was peering right into
the frontal lobes of men and women. No personality test ever gave me
this kind of illumination. Where does this leave

personality itself? Personality after all gives us a shorthand for
predicting what a person will think or do. The next two figures show the
expurgated word clouds for "neurotic" and "nonneurotic" people:

The nonneurotic word cloud is a portrait of high emotional stability---
psychological health and well-being---unlike any I have seen before.
What is ground truth here anyway? Is it the result of a personality test
that comes up "neurotic," or is it the top word cloud in the figure? The
next figure shows the word clouds for middle-aged people organized by
topic---there are easily computed statistics for discovering the topics
that people talk about.

Johannes, in his first year as a graduate student, made a major
discovery about cardiovascular death.15 He used the US county-bycounty
cardiovascular death rate from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention for 2010 and localized 82 million tweets by county of origin.
He then asked if he could predict death rate in a county just from
Twitter language and compared this to predictions of death rate using
the usual risk factors. Twitter alone out-predicted the ten leading risk
factors combined (income, education, smoking, diabetes, hypertension,
obesity, etc.) for cardiovascular death. The content of young people's
tweets predicted cardiovascular death of the older people at an
astonishingly high level of .67. The next figure shows the word cloud
for counties at high risk.

And the last figure shows the word cloud for counties protected from
cardiovascular death.

These were merely correlations, but could the word clouds be causal? Do
the words that run through your head activate the cardiovascular system
malignantly or benignly---all day long? If yes, then changing what you
think and what you say and what you write might be a royal road to
physical health. Our search for positive health uncovered protective
factors that tell us that health actually is not just the absence of
illness but the presence of something. By serendipity the search for
these protective factors opened a new window on the mind, and just
perhaps the very words and phrases that you say to yourself day and
night determine your physical health.

Part 5

Looking into the Future

Chapter Twenty-Seven

Homo Prospectus (2008--2016)

"HOLINESS, CAN I say what bothers me about Buddhism?" I asked the Dalai
Lama. He was unflappably positive, and my question did not ruffle him a
bit. We were on stage at a meeting titled "Mind and Its Potential" in
Sydney, Australia, on a scorching summer day in December 2009. His
Holiness was rarely challenged, and I tried to perk up an overly
reverential and sleepy discussion with a deep issue that was on my mind
much of the time. "Buddhism urges us to live in the present and to be
mindful of the present," I continued. "I don't agree. We are not beings
who dwell in the present. Our minds brim with futures. This is not to be
fought. The future is our nature. We are creatures who are drawn into
the future." WHERE WAS THIS outlandish idea coming from?

Traditional psychology's emphasis on the present and the past had been
bothering me since the founding of positive psychology. At first just
the glaring omission of the positive bothered me. Traditional psychology
tried to undo what was wrong, or tried to derive what was right from
what was not wrong, or neglected what was right altogether. Positive
psychology corrected this imbalance. But I suspected an even more
fundamental shortcoming: the future. Traditional psychology tells us
that we are creatures of the past and the present, which in turn give
rise to the future. Psychology-as-usual studies memory, a person's past,
as well as motivation and perception, the present. Predicting a person's
future actions will directly fall out from knowing his past and his
present ---somehow. This picture does violence to my own mental life. I
don't think much

about the past, and I certainly don't bask in the present. The present
is too brief to dwell in. Rather I spend an enormous amount of my time
imagining futures, daydreaming what-ifs, turning possible scenarios over
and over, upside down, and backward, and the older I get the more time I
spend in the future. The name of our species bothers me as well. Homo
sapiens means "wise man" or "knowing man," but in contrast to Homo
habilis, "handy man," and Homo erectus, "upright man," this name is not
a description but an aspiration. And not one that we live up to. What do
we actually do well that every other species does poorly? Language,
toolmaking, killing, rationality, tasting bad to predators,
cooperation---are all candidates. But when we look closely at other
mammals, birds, and even social insects, our uniqueness fades. So with
Dan Gilbert, professor of social psychology at Harvard,1 I believe that
the unrivaled human ability of imagining
futures---"prospection"---uniquely describes our species. We prospect
the future uniquely well, and this ability might ultimately make the
aspiration of wisdom a reality. Hence, we are better named Homo
prospectus.2 This promotes prospection to the front and center of
psychological science. In the traditional view, if you want to know what
I will do in the future, you need know, in principle, four things: My
history My genetic makeup The present stimuli My present drives and
motives Psychoanalysis, behaviorism, and most of cognitive psychology
accept this. But I do not. I have been working on agency, one way or
another, from learned helplessness on, all my life, and in thinking
about prospection, agency comes into focus most clearly. Here is the
great blind spot of the traditional framework that has gnawed at me for
fifty years: it leaves out human agency and its very fulcrum, a mind
that metabolizes the past and present to create the future and then
chooses among possible futures. There cannot be a positive psychology
without prospection. I first broached this idea with Roy Baumeister in
2008. We were

working together on mental energy---another sorely neglected topic in
psychology, orphaned by the field's abandonment of Freud's hydraulic
theory of emotional life. The baby of energy got thrown out with the
bathwater of Freud's concept of repression. Roy had resuscitated energy
to explain his memorable chocolate-chip cookie finding. His subjects sat
in front of a freshly baked plate of them but were told that they were
in the "radish group," which meant they could eat as many radishes as
they wanted but must not eat any cookies. Following this excruciating
resisting of temptation, Roy's subjects did worse at puzzles that
required trying and persistence.3 They were depleted of mental energy.
Roy and I tossed around the idea that consciousness uses energy and we
should try to measure how much. Roy suggested that consciousness is for
imagining possible futures (like eating a chocolate-chip cookie and then
feeling guilty). I fell in love with this idea, and a couple of drafts
about consciousness as simulating futures changed hands. In the
meantime, Roy published a learned Psychological Review article in which
this slant on consciousness appeared briefly but was swamped almost to
invisibility by other bowings and scrapings to the reviewers.4 In
October 2010, Chris Peterson and Nansook Park used their campus clout to
organize well-being as the University of Michigan's theme for the year.
There were happiness banners everywhere, and I was invited to deliver
the Tanner Lecture in philosophy about positive psychology. Over lunch,
I met Chandra Sripada, an assistant professor of both philosophy and
psychiatry. Chandra, meticulous of dress and speech, turned out to be a
working neuroscientist in addition. He mapped out network architecture
by the connectivity from one area to another. I had never before met
anyone who combined philosophy, psychiatry, neuroscience, and
psychology, and as I would discover over the next six years, Chandra was
a polymath---one of only a half dozen I have ever met. He was shocked
that I had never heard of the default network and opened my eyes to the
wondrous discovery of a reliable brain circuit that could well be how
the brain does its simulations of possible futures. "There must be at
least one thousand studies of the brain on a particular external task
like mental arithmetic or anagrams," Chandra began over our cafeteria lo
mein. "But you always have to run a 'rest' period for contrast. During
'rest' you tell the subject just to lie there and

not do anything." I nodded my head. "The circuits that light up for
mental arithmetic are pretty noisy, not quite a dead end, but a messy
signal-to-noise search. But what lights up at so-called rest is uniform
and reliable, so it is called the 'default' circuit, what the brain
defaults to at rest. "Now here is the shocker. This is not some sort of
empty rest. This is the same circuit that lights up when you ask the
person to imagine a personal future."5 My epiphany light bulb went on.
This must be the circuit that does the simulations that Roy and I
thought consciousness was all about. That evening the Michigan
professors of philosophy and psychology dined together over many bottles
of an indifferent red wine. I was seated next to Peter Railton, a
well-known moral philosopher. Peter told me that he worked on desire.
Desire, Peter said, is about forming a positive image of a possible
future. Desire exemplifies being drawn into the future rather than being
pushed by the past. At this point, I was called on to say a few words,
and I recalled Morton White's6 unfilled promise that philosophy should
someday rejoin its orphaned child, psychology. "We all pay lip service
to interdisciplinary work," I said. "Let's go around the room and say as
a result of this day what we will now do differently? Peter Railton and
I will start. We're going to write an article together on being drawn
into the future rather than driven by the past." This was the very first
that Railton had heard of our project. Nevertheless, it actually began a
few days later. Railton and Sripada sent me several articles to read,
and within two weeks, I sent them the very first of what would become
twenty drafts, which culminated in our article7 and ultimately our book
Homo Prospectus.8 In this first pass, I confessed my doubts about
traditional psychology and how a framework that put prospection front
and center would lead to better psychology. I suggested where a new
psychology should start. The hard determinism of traditional psychology
is a will-of-the-wisp because all science is at best statistical. No
science can ever be billiard-ball deterministic, and even the "simple"
problem of where three balls colliding will end up is only approximated
statistically. Knowing the genes, the past history, and the present
stimuli---even to a statistical asymptote (imagine it achieves the
never-achieved 0.99 accuracy)---will not come close to deducing what the
person will go on to do in any real-

time sequence, because .99 × .99 × .99 × .99 all too rapidly approaches
zero prediction. Therefore, discovering what the person expects,
intends, and desires in the future is usually a better starting-off
point than asking about past behavior. If you want to know what I will
do next Saturday night, the best place to start is by asking what I
intend to do next Saturday night, not what I did last Saturday night and
the Saturday night before. I gave "what consciousness is" my first try.
Human consciousness is the seat of agency. Agency consists in running
simulations of possible futures and deciding among them. Agency is
prospecting the future, and expectation, choice, decision, preference,
desire, and free will are all processes of prospection. Maybe all this
happens in the default network. My bottom line was that human action is
drawn by the future and influenced, but not driven, by the past. All of
this seemed pretty naive to Railton, the meticulous philosopher, and it
seemed out of touch to Sripada, the working neuroscientist, and they
began to rework these ideas into a more scholarly and sophisticated
form. Enter the Eagle Scouts of philanthropy: the John Templeton
Foundation. The foundation regularly asked me to spot initiatives that
were adventurous, good science, unlikely to be funded by disease
agencies like the National Institute of Mental Health, and compatible
with Sir John Templeton's vision of a science of human flourishing.

Spending weeks at a time with Roy Baumeister, Peter Railton, and Chandra
Sripada was like going to graduate school all over again, but in a
brand-new discipline: prospective psychology. Photo courtesy of Mandy
Seligman.

Peter Railton teaching us (Chandra Sripada, the author, and Roy
Baumeister) about moral realism.

Barnaby Marsh and Chris Stawski (both then advisors to Jack Templeton,
Sir John's neurosurgeon son, who succeeded to the presidency after Sir
John's death) took me to lunch, and I explained the idea of prospection
at length. "This is just the kind of science that Sir John loved," was
their first reaction. "Sir John thought that
imagination---future-mindedness---was the key to success." In due
course, the Templeton Foundation funded the four of us to write Homo
Prospectus and to do laboratory psychology and neuroscience on
prospection. They actually doubled down and created a \$3-million
research competition for the measurement, mechanisms, applications, and
improvement of prospection. We went to work and wrote draft after draft
of our first paper. Peter and I struggled over almost every line. He
wanted every sentence to be true on its own, but I wanted them to be
readable. Peter added qualifiers to achieve reviewer-friendly prose. I
cut out half his qualifiers to get reader-friendly prose. He stuffed
them back in. We ultimately sent it in to the leading theoretical
journal in psychology, the Psychological Review.

The editor told me it was "the most interesting paper he had read since
becoming editor," but it was not theoretical enough. We then sent it to
the Psychological Bulletin. The editor said that it was one of the most
interesting papers he had read since becoming editor, but it did not
review the literature exhaustively enough. We then sent it to
Perspectives on Psychological Science, also a leading journal. The
editor, Bobbie Spellman, said she could publish anything she wanted if
it was really good, and this paper was really good. She published it.
Spending weeks at a time with Roy, Chandra, and Peter was like going to
graduate school all over again---but in a brand-new discipline. The rest
of this chapter shares some of what I learned and what made me wish I
was twenty-one again. WHAT IF PERCEPTION is not the registration of what
is present but a useful

hallucination of what to expect? The modern understanding of vision
differs vastly from what I was taught. The visual system of the brain is
a column, where the bottom of the column gets almost point for point
what the retina registers. The next layer then gets a more abstract
version, and abstraction deepens on up to the top layer. The top layer
is extremely abstract, housing schemas for detecting such entities as a
table or even a basketball, for example. Strangely, however, there are
ten times as many connections going down from the top as there are up
from the bottom. Why? Our eyes jerk three times every second, but the
world stays stable. Top-down instructions to the lower layers explain
this stability. You watch a film of people passing a basketball around
and are instructed to count the number of passes. A gorilla walks across
the court. Half the observers do not see the gorilla. The top layer
tells the layers below that this is basketball: amplify the
basketball-relevant elements and inhibit gorilla elements. What we see
is not reality printing itself on our eyes but a hallucination of what
we expect to see next, a projection into the future.9 WHAT IF MEMORY is
not a file drawer of films and photographs but a

changing collection of possibilities most relevant to the future? In
writing this book, I have been astonished by how flawed my memory is. I
decided to write first and fact-check later. I had already written so
much about the topics that if I read what I originally wrote, my
rendering

would be boring for me and not nearly fresh enough for you. So when I
finally went about fact-checking---by looking at datebooks, articles,
books, and emails and asking living witnesses---I found disturbingly
many errors. Bob Kaiser, for example, insists that it was a purple 1947
Chevrolet, not a green 1948 Ford, that we raced around our drag track.
And that it cost thirty-five dollars, not fifty. But I can still see the
grill of our green Ford so clearly. This isn't Alzheimer's creeping up
on me. It is a brute fact about memory, and Ulric Neisser pinned this
down with his study of the Challenger disaster. Twenty-four hours after
it happened, the students in his introductory psychology class wrote
down where they were, what they were doing, and how they felt when they
heard the tragic news. Two and a half years later, they answered the
same questions and also said how confident they were about their
responses. There were gaping discrepancies, and only a quarter of the
students even remembered filling out the first questionnaire. Despite
the memory lapses, many students were completely confident about their
completely false recollections.10 Perhaps the fallibility of memory is
not a bug but an essential feature. Errors of memory, shifting and
shuffling bits of our old memories, might enable us to draw different
lessons from the past, lessons that are necessary for a better future.
WHAT IF FREE will is not about willing? The key to prospection is that
we

are constantly imagining possible futures and that each scenario comes
with a valence---how much we like or dislike it. Here's what Chandra
utterly persuaded me of: I believe the proper form of a philosophical
theory of free will is a "distinctive mark" theory. Consider the
question of what makes a Ferrari fast. It is unhelpful to cite the
pressing of the accelerator as what accounts for the Ferrari's fastness.
While it is true that accelerator pressing is necessary for the Ferrari
to cruise down the road at 100 miles an hour, citing this factor misses
the point of the question. Accelerators must be pressed in Ferraris and
non-Ferraris alike. The question of what makes a Ferrari fast is rather
a request for information about what is special or distinctive that
makes a Ferrari speedier than

other cars. A proper answer must say something, not about the pressing
of the accelerator, or the tightness of lug nuts, or the lack of
corrosion on the spark plugs, or all the things that are necessary for a
Ferrari to go fast, but rather must say something about the
distinguishing basis for the Ferrari's speediness. That is, it should
say something about the Ferrari's engine, and in particular its size or
power or its unique engineering. The philosophical question of free will
is similar. Of all the attributes and qualities of an agent that are
necessary for freedom, what is the distinctive mark that makes certain
creatures--- presumably humans, but perhaps other creatures as well---
free? That mark is the latitude of the scenarios we imagine. Humans,
unlike any other species, imagine futures that stretch and stretch. They
stretch over time---even whole lifetimes. They stretch over complex
sequences ---linear and branching. They stretch to hypotheticals and
counterfactuals ---What if life does not depend on carbon? What if the
Vikings had had gunpowder? The scope of our freedom, then, is exactly
the latitude of our imaginings. Willing now shrinks almost to
invisibility. We simply enact the scenario with the highest valence. How
we calculate valence remains unknown but is a proper subject for the
future study of free will. WHY DO WE FEEL anything at all? This is
called the "hard" problem of consciousness11 because it is... well, so
damn hard. Machines don't need

to feel anything to do their business perfectly. The mechanical tortoise
is programmed to register when it runs low on electricity and to return
to its nest and plug in. It doesn't need to experience anything at
all---not weariness, not homesickness. What does our subjective world of
experience---which is so close to being our very identity---add? Here
are the competing scenarios that crossed my mind in a matter of seconds
recently: 1. I could go on the internet and play bridge. Who might be

available? Mark Lair, but he's usually at lunch. Peter Friedland, he's
in Taiwan, probably going to sleep, but there are a few lesser lights
likely to be available. They make errors. Anyway, I've wasted a lot of
time playing bridge lately. 2. I might help Mandy teach Carly and Jenny
about the Silk Road. I don't know much about Asia. But the kids would
love it, and I haven't spent any time with them today. Mandy might find
it intrusive, having prepared the lesson. But she thinks I have not done
my share of teaching lately. 3. I might make myself some lunch. There's
some Moroccan chicken left over in the fridge. It's pretty high calorie
though. And I'm meeting Phil Voss for dinner at Le Bec Fin in only five
hours. But I could order only their three-course meal. Maybe Mandy was
saving the chicken for the kids' dinner. 4. I could keep working on this
damn paper. But I'm having trouble thinking through examples of
compelling counterfactual mental simulations. Maybe a bridge break will
help. But this is a pretty good example, maybe I should keep plugging.
Why bother? I don't have a deadline, since this paper is for my own
amusement. Peter Railton will be disappointed if I don't follow up soon.
5. All those tulip bulbs need planting. I could use the exercise,
particularly with Le Bec Fin coming up. The temperature is good, but the
ground is soggy. Tulips can be planted even if it gets really cold, no
rush. They might rot. I did lift weights for twenty minutes already
today. But I could use some fresh air. It would calm me down. I need it
particularly after my argument with the dean. Notice how
multidimensional these simulations are and also how incommensurable they
seem. By what measure does the pleasure of playing bridge with Mark Lair
stack up against the annoyance of letting tulip bulbs rot or the
satisfaction of seeing bright tulips in six months or the anticipation
of Moroccan chicken or guilt about not working out? Subjective feeling
is the brain's common currency for value, and it lets us compare
possible futures. A capacity for vivid conscious simulation could feed
into a final common path for comparisons. There is also the

genuine constraint that we must often make decisions very quickly, and
we may use acting in response to subjective feeling as the streamlined
readout to compare futures. We also need to compare the present, which
is cloaked in feeling, to possible futures. You walk into the tavern,
paycheck in hand, and must compare the pleasure of drinking now to the
ensuing fight with your wife and the pain of sleeping on the couch all
weekend. That these prospections are also cloaked with feeling allows us
to compare directly the present to the future as well as to compare one
possible future to another. THE FINAL THING I learned from working with
Roy, Peter, and Chandra

had to do with creativity itself and how it fares with aging, a topic of
obvious concern to me. Can creativity increase with age?12 Creativity
employs an exquisite kind of prospection: imagining something original
and surprising and useful that is not present to the senses. The
research literature strongly suggests that creativity wanes as we get
old. I am in mind of that day in Oxford in 1975 when John Teasdale and I
began our reformulation of learned helplessness together. Our public
agreement to do this did not end the day. Another encounter right
afterward echoed many years beyond the collaboration that John and I had
just undertaken. As I am seventy-five, this encounter is particularly
resonant right now. I was invited to dinner at Donald Broadbent's chicly
modern house in an Oxford suburb. Jerry Bruner was the other guest. Not
one for social chitchat and mindful of the uniqueness of this
opportunity, I raised a topic that I was very curious about. At age
thirty-two, I worried that I had peaked, and much research suggests that
the mid-thirties are the high-water mark of scientific creativity. I
knew the careers of the two luminaries I was dining with. Donald was
about fifty and did his great work on dichotic listening at about my
age. Jerry was almost sixty and had done his great work on thought going
beyond the data given twentyfive years before, in his early thirties as
well. Truth to tell, I was less impressed by what they had done since.
"It's an honor to be with the two of you this evening," I said. "I am a
fan of both of your careers, and I know your work pretty well and when
you did it. Now tell me honestly, when were you at your most creative?"

"Right now!" they roared in unison. Even more strikingly, when I
recently asked Aaron Beck, in his midnineties, the same question, he
responded with exactly those words. And when I ask myself the very same
question, I answer, "Right now." I wonder if we were all harboring a
benign, defensive illusion. That creativity might increase well into
later life flies in the face of the data. Much research shows that
creativity peaks within a couple of decades of the start of a career,
earlier with mathematics and poetry, later in science, history, and
philosophy.13 Here's the damage that aging does,14 and I can testify to
each of these personally: • We're slower. Neural conduction speed
decreases markedly. • We're forgetful. Memory is much worse. • We're
tired. Stamina decreases. • We're rigid. Hardening of the categories
increases. • We're banal. Originality decreases.15 Wait,
originality---divergent thinking---decreases? Doesn't that end the
discussion? Creativity requires originality, which in turn requires
prospection, which in turn requires imagination. Paving my driveway with
salami is an original idea, but it is useless. Creativity demands more
than originality; also requires usefulness and a good sense of who will
make use of the idea, the audience. "Audience" can refer to a literal
audience in the arts but often alludes to the gatekeeping members of the
discipline in academia. What gets better with age that might outweigh
all these losses? First, knowledge itself increases. Even though I have
forgotten a huge amount, I know more in total now. I know, for example,
almost automatically about how to use Big Data to get around the
artifacts of questionnaires and why the default network might be the
imagination network. I not only know more facts from my own discipline,
but I know more generally. I recently took Jenny and Carly to the
architecturally magnificent Native American Museum in Washington, DC. On
hearing that European diseases carried by Christopher Columbus's sailors
had decimated the native Carib population, Jenny, then seven, asked,
"Why

weren't the European sailors killed off by Carib diseases?" The answer
is crossroads. Europe of the fifteenth century had stood at the
crossroads of many civilizations for 2,000 years. With the diversity of
people who traipsed through Europe as traders, soldiers, and slaves came
the diversity of their diseases. This host of plagues honed the immune
systems of Europeans; those who survived had the ability to fight off a
great variety of diseases and passed on their disease-fighting genes.
The Carib "Indians," highly interbred, did not have the dubious benefit
of encountering one different plague after another in their
immunological history, and so they were devastated. It is not just the
immune system that thrives with diversity; ideas do too. Crossroads
thinking is general knowledge and underpins creativity. Jared Diamond
points out that Tasmanian Aborigines were at a cognitive disadvantage
compared with Australian Aborigines. Tasmania is cut off by the almost
impassable Tasman Strait, whereas geography does not block trade across
Australia. The sophistication of Australian tools increased across 2,000
years, whereas that of Tasmanian tools deteriorated.16 Creativity
sharpens tools and also brings different ways of thinking to make
connections among seemingly unrelated concepts. Crossroads thinking
implies diversity. If experience consists only of repeated examples of
the same thing, it adds little. I was at a faculty meeting about forty
years ago, and Frank Irwin, then the grand old man of our department,
said, "I've had twenty years of experience with this" (what "this" was,
I forget). Assistant professor Frank Norman, then a young Turk, said,
"There's twenty years of experience, Dr. Irwin, and there's one year of
experience twenty times." BESIDES MORE SPECIFIC and general knowledge, a
second benefit of age

for creativity is that shortcuts and guidelines get better. The story
about Isaac Newton and the apple is apparently true, but not the
apple-falling-off-the-tree version that we learned at school. One
evening when Newton was at his family's farm during the plague years, he
was at his desk. An apple sat on the surface and the moon rose behind
it, occupying the same visual space. Aha! Newton wondered if same force
that holds the moon in orbit could draw the apple to the ground.17
Newton was a "natural." Really wondrous here is the scaffolding that
permitted him to perceive the apple and the moon in just that perfect
way to point toward gravity and the inverse-square law.

Newton had this scaffolding in place in his early twenties. How could so
much scaffolding have been erected so early? It is commonly said that
Newton was a genius, and with that statement the mystery is thrown back
on another mystery: the brain, a gift, God, birth from Zeus's brow, or
"talent." Angela Duckworth has demystified talent at least a bit.18
Talent is the rate at which a skill is acquired. Newton was fast and
could soak up information more quickly than the rest of us. He had
knowledgebased shortcuts that allowed him to see to the bottom faster
and with less input. I think an alternate explanation of Newton calls
not on a gift from the gods but on experience: shortcuts. My guess is
that Newton's being a "natural" came from continual reverie about
physics and mathematics, and this huge amount of "time on task" created
the shortcuts that permitted him to see that the apple plus the moon
equals gravity. While I am certainly no Newton, I have been through so
much in my continual daily reverie about psychological issues that I
have an immense latticework of shortcuts that allow me to leap from one
building to the next with ease. Newton had it at twenty-two, but it took
me decades to build. For example, I used to read every word of a journal
article laboriously. Now I just scan because I can infer huge swaths of
what the whole article contains. I know that if Bob Rescorla wrote it, I
don't have to worry about the adequacy of the control groups. These
kinds of shortcuts save me a lot of time that I can put to better use
elsewhere. save time, guidelines more formally called "heuristics"
likely get better with age. Many guidelines are about what not to
do---negative heuristics that tell you how to avoid errors. "Recency,"
for example, is one: if a long friendship has just ended on a bitter
note, you will underestimate how worthwhile the friendship was, relative
to a lower-quality friendship that just petered out. I use some negative
heuristics specific to doing psychology: BESIDES SHORTCUTS THAT

• If the theory contains "self-\[esteem, efficacy, worth, compassion\],"
hold on to your wallet. • If you need fancy statistics to see a result,
think twice. • If an article ends with "more research is needed," be
skeptical.

• If "qualitative study" or "focus group" appears, stop reading. I use
negative heuristics in daily life: don't promise more than you can
deliver; never be sarcastic; check your work repeatedly; don't be late;
when in doubt stand on principle. These are some of the "thou shalt
nots" by which I have learned to live. But I repeat a major caveat in
the context of the heuristics that may improve with age: not getting it
wrong does not equal getting it right. There are positive heuristics
that are more important than negative heuristics, and these likely get
better with age. Imagine making a speech with no grammatical errors. Or
writing a memoir in which you say nothing untrue. Or serving a meal in
which nothing tastes bad. Or proving a theorem in which every statement
is true. Or playing a Beethoven piano sonata with no mistakes. Or
chairing a meeting in which no one is discourteous. None of these
guarantees a good speech, a good book, a good meal, a good proof, a good
performance, or a good meeting. Guidelines of the form "thou shalt"
create goodness, right, beauty, and truth over and above the mere
absence of badness, wrong, ugliness, or falsehood. Discovering positive
heuristics is a much harder task than discovering shortcuts to avoid
errors, and unlike negative heuristics, positive heuristics are at the
heart of creativity. Enumerating them is well beyond me, but here are a
few I have learned to use in psychology: • A good theory makes
surprising counterintuitive predictions (e.g., treating depression as
prospection gone awry will work better than correcting false beliefs
about the past and the present). • Begin with an anecdote that distills
the idea (e.g., "Sauce béarnaise used to be my favorite sauce") and only
then challenge the reader with the details of experiments and theory. •
Drill down to the most basic assumption and ask, if it were false, what
would follow (e.g., What if early-childhood trauma has only minor
effects on adult personality? Then adolescence might be the crucial time
that wreaks the tectonic changes in who we will become, and intervening
then will do more good than earlychildhood interventions).

• A good piece of science tells the reader that something she thought
was false is true, or something she thought was true is false. You will
read about a whopper that stands learned helplessness on its head in the
next chapter. Beyond allowing one to glean more knowledge and better
shortcuts and guidelines, aging helps counterbalance the losses with a
keener sense of audience. Creativity requires the accurate evaluation
that the original and surprising idea will be useful, beneficial, and
desired by the relevant audience.19 "Audience" is both literal, as in
the arts and commerce, and figurative, in the case of academic
disciplines. Here "audience" refers to the gatekeepers---the individuals
who have the power to decide which contributions are creative. Isaac
Newton at age twenty-three had an exquisite sense of audience. Returning
from two plague years at home, he had written three papers: one on
optics, one on calculus, and one on gravitation. His audience was his
mentor, Sir Isaac Barrow, who responded by resigning his Lucasian
professorship in 1669 in favor of Newton. (Oh, to have such a student!
Oh, to have such objectivity!) Writing about creativity offers an
example of the importance of audience. Creativity is an overworked
topic, and almost everything has been said about it. For an article
about creativity to see the light of day, it is a good idea to first
send a draft to Dean Simonton, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Teresa Amabile,
and Howard Gardner and patiently wait for their comments. Their work
needs to be cited (favorably if possible) and their papers read
carefully. I blush to say that I have failed to do this all too often in
my eagerness to get on to my next work. Dick Solomon had a much better
grasp of this principle than I. He always sent his drafts out to the
gatekeepers first, and blessed with Harold Schlosberg on one shoulder
and Walter Hunter on the other, commenting on each sentence, Dick had a
great sense of audience. Ideas that are a half step ahead of the
audience are good "normal" science, and the journals are filled with
these. While usually boring to read, they provide the cumulative bricks.
Papers that are two steps ahead of the gatekeepers are rejected as
outlandish. If you wish to succeed in normal science, stay just one step
ahead, but do venture an occasional one-and-one-half-step paper to keep
your sense of self-respect.

I ASKED THE Dalai Lama what follows if we are not of the present but are

drawn into the future. He was sympathetic and encouraged me to pursue
it. With Peter, Chandra, and Roy, over the next five years, we put
prospection front and center, and this illuminated several huge issues
in psychology and neuroscience that were completely opaque in the
framework in which the past and the present determine the future.
Consciousness became the process by which humans envision the future.
The default network became the imagination network. Subjectivity became
the common currency we use to compare future scenarios. Freedom of the
will became the latitude of the scenarios we envisage. Creativity became
the combination of original and surprising prospections coupled with a
keen sense of audience, meaning that creativity can increase with age
and might be teachable at any age. Even though it may be a myth, I end
this chapter with this story. On Nov. 18, 1995, Itzhak Perlman, the
violinist, came on stage to give a concert at Avery Fisher Hall at
Lincoln Center in New York City. If you have ever been to a Perlman
concert, you know that getting on stage is no small achievement for him.
He was stricken with polio as a child, and so he has braces on both legs
and walks with the aid of two crutches. To see him walk across the stage
one step at a time, painfully and slowly, is an unforgettable sight. He
walks painfully, yet majestically, until he reaches his chair. Then he
sits down, slowly, puts his crutches on the floor, undoes the clasps on
his legs, tucks one foot back and extends the other foot forward. Then
he bends down and picks up the violin, puts it under his chin, nods to
the conductor and proceeds to play.... But this time, something went
wrong. Just as he finished the first few bars, one of the strings on his
violin broke. You could hear it snap---it went off like gunfire across
the room. There was no mistaking what that sound meant.... He waited a
moment, closed his eyes then signaled the conductor to begin again. The
orchestra began, and he played from where he had left off. He played
with

overwhelming passion and power and purity. Of course, anyone knows that
it is impossible to play a symphonic work with just three strings. I
know that, and you know that, but that night Itzhak Perlman refused to
know that. You could see him modulating, changing, recomposing the piece
in his head. At one point, it sounded like he was detuning the strings
to get new sounds from them that they had never made before. When he
finished, there was an awesome silence in the room. And then people rose
and cheered. There was an extraordinary outburst of applause from every
corner of the auditorium. We were all on our feet, screaming and
cheering, doing everything we could to show how much we appreciated what
he had done. He smiled, wiped the sweat from this brow, raised his bow
to quiet us, and then he said, not boastfully, but in a quiet, pensive,
reverent tone, "You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out
how much music you can still make with what you have left."20

Chapter Twenty-Eight

The Hope Circuit (2016)

AFTER FINISHING OUR PhDs at Penn in the late 1960s, Steve Maier and I
went in opposite directions. I spun outward from learned helplessness,
applying it to larger and larger targets: human depression, physical
illness, psychotherapy, schools, businesses, the army, and, as you will
soon read, even a flourishing human future. Steve went inward. He
essentially switched fields and retrained as a serious neuroscientist
studying how the brain circuits in rats influence behavior. He did not
return to helplessness until the 1990s. When he did, he changed
everything. Steve took an assistant professorship in the University of
Illinois's psychology department in 1968. He had a weird teaching style,
but it won the undergraduate teaching award. He did not lecture; he only
answered questions. I met Greg Kimble, a venerable learning theorist,
and he told me about a new department he was forming at the University
of Colorado in Boulder. He asked me if I was interested. I had just been
tenured at Penn and was not moving again. Steve, I recalled, loved the
outdoors, so I told Greg, "Try Steve Maier." Greg did, and Steve left
the plains of Illinois for the mountains of Colorado, where he stayed
for the rest of his career---hiking and bicycling through these
mountains on weekends. He molted, no longer a flabby city kid, and even
in his midseventies, he is, annoyingly, a model of trim, muscular
fitness. Steve went on to make the most important discovery in our
field, and his discoveries turned learned helplessness on its head. He
showed that the arrow of causality that we had postulated was wrong and
that it was not helplessness but control and mastery that were learned.
He discovered the brain circuits that produce and prevent helplessness,
and their functions are wildly different from what we had expected all
those

years ago. How Steve discovered this is a mite technical but the
prettiest example of neuroscience that I know, so I urge the reader to
bear with the telling. This chapter recounts his story; I play the role
of admirer. The years I'd spent working on positive psychology gave me a
special appreciation for just how profound his findings were. I first
need to remind you what our theory said originally and what we
discovered fifty years ago. Our theory essentially claimed that animals
learned that nothing they did mattered, and so they expected that
nothing they did in the future would matter. This expectation of
helplessness undermined trying to escape bad events in the future. Our
evidence came from the triadic design: in the first phase, one group
(ESC) of animals got escapable shock, a second group got exactly the
same pattern of shock but the shock continued regardless of what they
did (INESC), and a third group got no shock (Zero). In the second phase
all the animals went to a shuttle box, usually twenty-four hours after
the first phase. Most of the animals in the INESC group then failed to
escape in the shuttle box; they just lay there passively. Almost all the
animals in the ESC and Zero groups learned to escape shock well in the
shuttle box. Steve, of course, was eager to know what the brain of the
rat was doing, but good tools for looking closely at brain circuitry
only got developed in the 1990s. Steve wondered where to start and
reasoned backward from the passive behavior and heightened anxiety in
the INESC group. Helpless rats showed aborted fight and flight and
increased anxiety (panic), and the brain structures for these were known
by the 1990s: the dorsal periaqueductal gray controls fight or flight
and the amygdala controls panic. It looked as if INESC rats had
inhibited dorsal periaqueductal gray function and exaggerated amygdala
function. And there is a structure---the dorsal raphe nucleus
(DRN)---that projects to both, inhibiting one and potentiating the
other. It does this by releasing serotonin, 5-HT, which in turn leads to
the release of 5-HT in the amygdala and dorsal periaqueductal gray down
the line. This produces passivity and panic. To my non-neuroscience
reader: I am going to simplify and keep to the bare bones of what you
need to know about the brain to appreciate how Steve did it. The dorsal
raphe nucleus is one structure you will need to remember and the
transmitter, 5-HT (serotonin), is another, because activating the DRN
directly and getting its release of 5-HT produces just the same
deficits---panic and inhibited fight-or-flight response---as

inescapable shock does. So Steve reasoned that if inescapable shock
produces a powerful activation of the DRN 5-HT neurons leading to the
release of 5-HT in the amygdala and dorsal periaqueductal gray, then the
DRN might be the crucial node in INESC producing learned helplessness.
But it would also have to be true that escapable shock does not activate
the DRN. Got it so far? If not, stop scanning, slow down, and reread the
previous paragraph. Steve's group then demonstrated exactly this:
inescapable shock activates the neurons in the DRN that contain 5-HT,
and exactly equal escapable shock does not.1 Yet, to withstand
scientific scrutiny, these findings alone were not enough. The fact that
INESC shock activated DRN 5-HT neurons did not mean that this process is
either necessary or sufficient to produce helplessness. So next Steve
showed that DRN activation was necessary for helplessness to occur and
that it was sufficient. In other words, DRN activation always produced
helplessness, and nothing else did. He determined necessity by blocking
the DRN activation produced by inescapable shock with lesions or
injection of drugs to the DRN.2 These prevented inescapable shock from
producing its usual poor escape and panic: rats that got INESC but had
the DRN blocked were not helpless. He determined sufficiency simply by
injecting drugs that activate 5HT neurons into the DRN, producing the
same passivity and panic as does INESC shock. Rats that got no shock at
all but had an excited DRN were helpless. So the activation of the DRN
is necessary and sufficient to produce passivity and panic. (Pause. If
your hold on this material is shaky, go back and read the last page
again.) To this point, Steve's experiments had shown only the brain
chemistry behind the behaviors we'd witnessed decades before. But now a
new question arose, one that we couldn't have considered in 1964 because
neuroscience hadn't come far enough: Why does the DRN respond only if
the shock is inescapable? The obvious option is that the DRN detects
that shock is inescapable. However, the DRN is a tiny brainstem
structure (perhaps 20,000 to 30,000 neurons in the rat, 150,000 cells in
the human), and so it is unlikely to have the processing power to detect
no control. The next possibility is that the DRN receives greater

excitatory input during inescapable than during escapable shock, thereby
leading to more activation with inescapable shock. But this turned out
not to be so. If the rats were not learning helplessness, only one
obvious possibility remained: that being helpless was a natural,
unlearned, default response to prolonged shock. This, in turn, meant
that the presence of control must somehow be learned high up in the
cortex, and this learning must turn off the DRN and so abort
helplessness. In other words, helplessness wasn't learned; control was.
Steve tested this theory and confirmed it was true. Through further
experiments he located the actual pathway---within the medial prefrontal
cortex (MPFC)---that was the agent of the change we'd seen all those
years before. The MPFC-DRN pathway was the key, and it didn't teach
those rats helplessness; it taught them control. Steve showed that
turning this pathway on or off chemically overrode the external
contingencies. He first taught rats to escape by turning a wheel. They
did this perfectly well, even when the MPFC-DRN pathway was turned off
chemically. But crucially they were later helpless in the shuttle box.
Completing the tour de force, he first made the rats passive and
helpless, because their wheel turning did not matter. But he turned this
pathway on chemically during the helplessness. Crucially these rats were
not helpless later in the shuttle box.3 The development of a new circuit
that sent the information about control to turn off the DRN required the
production of new proteins, and Steve's group showed that blocking new
protein synthesis in the MPFC after escapable shock allowed helplessness
to later occur.4 That is, even though the subjects exerted control and
the MPFC was activated, the rats were helpless later unless new proteins
could be formed. These particular proteins, called plasticity proteins,
were indeed induced in the MPFC by escapable shock.5 So Steve concluded
that the MPFC-DRN pathway was modified in the several hours after the
experience of escapable shock, and this altered pathway was crucial to
the expectation that shock would be controllable in the future. Keep
this newly formed MPFC-DRN pathway in mind. What in the world is it?
Steve's findings turned learned helplessness on its head. Helplessness
wasn't learned; only control was. Did this mean our first great finding
was a mistake? What did the original learned helplessness theory get

right, and what did it get wrong? As the original theory claimed,
organisms do indeed learn about the dimension of control, and this
dimension is critical. However, the dimension detected and learned about
was the presence, not the absence, of control. This did not mean that
animals were born helpless, but it did mean that they became helpless
when faced with sustained negative experiences. The passivity and panic
that followed INESC for several days was an unlearned reaction to
prolonged aversive stimulation. This meant that helplessness is not
learned; it is some kind of mammalian default response to bad things.
Steve had showed that learning about control aborted this default
process. He'd discovered a pathway for defeating helplessness. Clearly,
this was a substantial revision to the theory we developed fifty years
ago. When we found that dogs given inescapable shock later failed to
learn to escape in a shuttle box, but that dogs given escapable shock
later escaped normally, the ideas we developed were our guess about what
is most adaptive for dogs, rats, and people. We reasoned that active
coping was best because this would minimize bad events, and so we
assumed that organisms would initially expect control to be possible and
try to escape. If the stressor proved to be uncontrollable, organisms
would then learn this and expect it to be true in the future, with this
expectation of uncontrollability undermining trying. However, the neural
data do not support this. Instead, the presence of control is the active
ingredient, leading to the inhibition of default DRN giving up. Perhaps
this counterintuitive arrangement makes more sense if we consider
evolution. For our ancient ancestors, threats engaged defensive
reflexes, and these reflexes cost energy. If the reflexes were
unsuccessful, it would be adaptive to shut them down and conserve energy
for adjustments that promote survival, such as altering the immune
system to better fight any infection or wound that might occur.
Primitive organisms, such as reptiles, do not have the sensory apparatus
to detect threats at a great distance; nor do they have complex
responding to deploy for control. Bad events for primitive organisms are
generally uncontrollable by any available voluntary behavior, and so
primitive organisms do not need mechanisms to detect controllability.
Thus, the success of defensive reflexes is likely related to how long
the existing threat lasts---if it is prolonged, then passivity and
conservation would be adaptive, with energy being shifted to
physiological adjustments to

threat. It is important that 5-HT is phylogenetically ancient and has,
from the beginning, been involved in shifting the balance of the flow of
energy. As organisms became more complex in evolution, they began to
detect and identify threats at a distance. And so they developed rich
behavioral and cognitive skills to control threats. Control became
available even against prolonged threats. So passivity and other energy
adjustments set in motion by the continuation of threat should shut down
when control works. Thus, when high mammals encounter a threat, here is
what happens. First, defensive reflexes occur, activating the DRN. 5-HT
builds if the threat continues long enough, and if 5-HT reaches some
threshold, voluntary trying is shut down, and energy flow is shifted.
However, detection of control shuts down the DRN so that trying will
continue. Further, when control exists, plasticity occurs in the
MPFC-DRN circuit so that the system now learns, reacting to bad events
as if they are escapable, thereby prolonging trying. This is why expert
athletes, soldiers, and pilots are calm under pressure. Their brains
detect and expect control when others panic and freeze. In short,
control is a relatively recent adaptation in evolutionary history. Our
experiments showed just how powerful it can be, and Steve's showed
exactly where in the brain it lodged. THERE ARE TWO main takeaways. The
first is that our default response to

prolonged bad events is helplessness and heightened anxiety. The second
is that our higher cortical processes inhibit this default helplessness.
These higher cortical processes buffer against, but do not annihilate,
the default passivity of the DRN. This paints an up-from-helplessness
neural picture that fits human development well. As a species we are
born helpless, and as infants and toddlers we stay immature for a very
long time. Indeed, this slow maturation may be crucial to our success as
a species. Perhaps during this time we are gradually learning more and
more control. Importantly rats that learn mastery early in life resist
helplessness when exposed to inescapable shock later in life, and it is
exactly the MPFC-DRN pathway that prevents this later helplessness.6
Early experience with control immunizes us against the ravages of
uncontrollability later in life, perhaps through this pathway. But I
still wondered exactly what

psychological process this all-important circuit was. All this has major
implications for therapy. Therapy that tries to undo trauma is not
likely to work. Trauma is here to stay. Treatment that dwells on past
trauma and present misery without emphasizing planning for a better
future may be for naught. Consider the classes of therapy in which the
patient reviews a past trauma in order to gain insight into its causes
or to have catharsis about it. The circuitry suggests that merely
confronting, understanding and reliving the trauma cannot achieve much.
Confronting the past is not the province only of psychodynamic therapy;
it is also common in popular cognitive-behavioral therapies: discussion
of rumination, discussion of memory biases like selective filtering
(where the patient only attended to a negative part of something that
happened and ignored the positive parts), behavior-chain analysis (where
the patient looks at all the steps that led up to an eating or drinking
binge and considers how those steps set him up to "fail"), and
catastrophizing about the present are all modern techniques that work on
the present without necessarily addressing the future. A skilled and
experienced therapist can lead a patient through these exercises about
the past and the present with the added, explicit purpose of changing
future behavior, such as better recognizing triggers for past
maladaptive responses in order to avoid those triggers in the future or
gaining insight into catastrophizing in order to learn how to be more
optimistic. So therapy that explicitly creates end runs around trauma,
buffers against it, and uses the past and the present as vehicles for
planning a better future is more likely to work. This circuit also
implies something that---skeptical about the overselling of
neuroscience---I have never countenanced before: that there may come a
day when we can treat depression by turning on the MPFC-DRN pathway
directly or by turning off the DRN directly. Steve's discoveries were
about rats, of course. But human beings have quite similar structures.
Right now we do not have anything like the tools to identify these
circuits in human beings. Nor do we have the tools to turn on or turn
off these structures by drugs or transmagnetic stimulation or
optogenetics (the use of light to stimulate neurons). But that day will
soon come, and depression and panic in humans---I say this for the very
first time---might become curable. It is gratifying to have lived long
enough and to be in a vibrant enough science to find out you were wrong.
Helplessness is not learned

as we first thought; it is the default reaction of mammals to prolonged
bad events. What is vouchsafed to humans, however, is a magnificent
cortex, a top-down structure that learns mastery over bad events. We can
learn---and teach---that future bad events will be controllable, and
this will buffer us against helplessness and anxiety. THIS DISCOVERY WAS
profound. But I still didn't fully grasp what this

circuit really was until the middle of a long, strange night. I had been
mulling over Steve's data for more than a year. We were writing a
Psychological Review article together,7 but I was still bewildered. I
felt the MPFC-DRN circuit was tremendously important, that it made
evolutionary sense, and that it was more important even than Steve
thought, but I couldn't put my finger on why. My friend and patron Jack
Templeton died of brain cancer on May 22, 2015. Jack and I still had so
much unfinished business to do together: to increase the creativity of
the next generation, to raise positive psychology to the next level, and
to understand the biology of hope and how it relates to spiritual
flourishing. He had been a rock of support for all of these. His
memorial service was scheduled for June 11, 2015, at 10:30 a.m. at an
evangelical Presbyterian church in nearby Bryn Mawr. A thousand people
from all over the world would come---representatives of all the good
works that Jack supported---and I planned to be there as well. But on
June 10, Mandy took me to hospital. There was a cyst on my spine, and I
was having trouble walking. I'd had a similar episode a year before, and
surgery to remove the cyst had kept me in bed for almost a month. I
recovered completely, and the cyst was benign. The surgeons now operated
while visualizing my spinal cord in real time---an amazing new
technique---and the new cyst was aspirated. I came out of general
anesthesia after midnight. All was well---the cyst was benign
again---but I was advised to stay in bed for the next few days. Mandy
put me to bed at 1 a.m. Three hours later I awoke suddenly from a deep
sleep, completely alert. My very first thought was that I knew what the
MPFC-DRN circuit was. I just knew it. It was the hope circuit. All this
fell suddenly into place. I didn't know the details yet, but I knew I
was right and rushed downstairs to write an email to Steve. I started
the email at 5:35 a.m. and finished at 5:57 a.m. At the moment I put my
finger on the send button,

all the electricity in Lower Merion Township died. A scene from the
movie Field of Dreams crossed my mind. The protagonist, Ray, tells his
wife Annie, "When primal forces of nature tell you to do something, the
prudent thing is not to quibble over details."

I want to tell Jack Templeton about a discovery he would have loved.
Jack and I talked often about a science of hope and its relation to
faith. Jack wanted there to be a "hope circuit" in the brain, and I can
tell him now that there is. Photo courtesy of the John Templeton
Foundation.

The power came back on at 6:20 a.m., and I hit send. The email was
delivered to Steve. I next opened my snail mail and read a note of
thanks from Mathew White, sent with a copy of his new book on positive
education at Saint Peter's College in Adelaide.8 I glanced at the
chapter on positive

Christianity and read, "Religion and science are opposed but only in the
same sense in which my thumb and forefinger are opposed---and between
the two, one can grasp everything." This was the focal issue for Jack
and his father, Sir John Templeton. I burst into tears and had a command
hallucination to put on a suit and go to the memorial service. Which I
did. I arrived at the church shortly before the service began and saw
Jack's widow, Pina. I told her about my midnight epiphany. She told me
that I should testify. There were two eulogies for Jack scheduled, and I
should give a third. So after Stephen Post's eulogy, I was announced. "I
want to tell Jack what happened to me this morning and to tell Jack
about a discovery he would have loved. Jack and I talked often about a
science of hope and its relation to faith." I narrated the surgery, the
sudden awakening, the MPFC-DRN mystery, and the blackout. Finally I
added, "Between science and religion one can grasp everything." "Jack
wanted there to be a 'hope circuit' in the brain, and I can tell him now
that there is," I concluded. There was a stunned silence. I left the
church and went home to bed. I stayed there for days.

Chapter Twenty-Nine

Turning the World

FIRST, DURING MY LIFETIME psychology abandoned behaviorism and took
cognition seriously. Second, during my lifetime psychology turned its
attention from misery toward happiness. Third, during my lifetime
psychology finally took evolution and the brain seriously. And fourth,
during my lifetime psychology moved from its obsession with the past to
researching how the brain thinks about the future. But how much does
cognitive psychology matter? How much does evolutionary psychology
matter? How much does positive psychology matter? How much does a
psychology of prospection matter? How much does a hope circuit matter?
And how much did my role in these transformations matter? These are
questions a memoirist cannot evade. On most days, my answer is "not
much." Each of them was likely a mere baby step in scientific and
cultural progress, either to be soon forgotten, or overtaken by the next
fad, or in the best case assimilated, with the proper footnote, into the
next step in scientific progress. Each of them likely would have
occurred without me, only a bit later. Any realistic person likely
believes something like this about his or her own work, and it would not
be worth writing a chapter to echo such a commonplace sentiment. And
yet... On a really good day, I think these ideas do matter for the long
future and that my role was crucial. This chapter talks about what I
believe on a really good day---first what I believe about my role and
how I personally changed over my life, then what I believe about how
important these changes in psychology are for the long human future. My
Role

At my fiftieth college reunion in May 2014, I sat on a panel of
wellknown Princeton alumni. "Career trajectory" was the topic. "I wrote
about cooking, and it really felt good, so I wrote more funny stories
about food," a New York Times columnist said. "I picked up the banjo,
and the audience loved it, so I devoted myself to playing blues," a
popular musician said. Their prevailing narrative was "I tried this...
it felt good, so I did it more" or "I tried that... people didn't like
it, so I stopped," and so, blown hither and thither by their
proclivities, by prevailing winds, and internal and external rewards and
punishments, they arrived at their professions. "Not me," I said. "I was
called." one is called by the future is a common human experience.
Moses's Burning Bush is the paradigm. But many of the rest of us have
such experiences. When Gallup asked Americans if they'd had a "profound
religious experience or awakening that changed the direction" of their
lives, 41 percent agreed that the statement "completely applie\[d\] to
them," and 30 to 40 percent felt they had a calling.1 I number myself
among them. I was around thirty, newly tenured at the University of
Pennsylvania, an animal experimental psychologist, and a
dyed-in-the-wool learning theorist. My teacher, Aaron Beck, warned me
that if I continued on this path, I would "waste my life," and a
numinous dream then rattled me enough to change my trajectory. I have
paid attention to dreams and epiphanies for my entire scientific career.
When I first saw a helpless dog in the fall of 1964, I "saw" almost to
the end the implications of this discovery and its future directions,
although it took fifty years and a new neuroscience to pin them down.
Positive psychology as well. On a late winter day in 2002, I was walking
near the Lincoln Memorial in a cold and hard rain with David Larson. We
were huddling together under an umbrella after a meeting in Washington.
David would die about two weeks later, suddenly, at the age of
fifty-four. Having never met him before, I told him that I admired the
bold steps he'd taken as an executive at the National Institute of
Mental Health. David founded a branch to investigate the relationship of
health to spirituality, a topic quite out of keeping with the
institute's usual priorities. After an uphill battle, David won, and
while not a lot of money got channeled into this, it was a breakthrough
in the otherwise remedial, THE BELIEF THAT

pedestrian projects funded by the government. "How did you think the
idea up?" I asked. "I didn't, Marty," he replied. "I was told to do it.
How about you and positive psychology?" "I was told to do it." WHY ME?
WHY NOT Al Bandura, Richard Lazarus, Julian Rotter, Mike

Csikszentmihalyi, or Ed Diener? All of these scientists were farther
along, fruitfully investigating the positive side of life. Any of them
might have invited other scientists and practitioners of the positive
into the big tent and so ignited the movement. That I was president of
the American Psychological Association (APA), a very bully pulpit, and
in need of a transformational theme mattered. That I emerged from
working on the really bad stuff---helplessness, depression,
panic---mattered. I could see and name the missing piece---the
positive---because of this stark contrast with the demoralizing
awfulness I usually worked on. That I had serious doubts about what was
"basic" mattered, and so I was less purely academic than my peers,
having struggled uphill for twenty years in advocating the application
of psychology to the real world. Positive psychology had only a mere
outline, not a master plan. Deciding to run for president of APA was not
the culmination of long deliberation. A recurring joyful image of a
fetus floating above the Earth from the movie 2001 somehow propelled it.
With Mike Csikszentmihalyi and Ray Fowler in early January of 1998, we
sketched out what the new field would need to thrive: funding, just the
right leaders, and the young people. These all fell into place without
our doggedly pursuing them: Atlantic Philanthropies, Templeton, Jim
Hovey, Gallup, and Neal Mayerson all came to me, not vice versa. Bob
Nozick, Chris Peterson, Ed Diener, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, and George
Vaillant hopped on board without much urging. Barb Fredrickson, Jon
Haidt, Laura King, Sonja Lyubomirsky, James Pawelski, and a dozen other
talented young scientists answered the call and stayed the course.
Prospection also had the same feel: Roy Baumeister's idea that
consciousness is for imagining futures, Chandra Sripada's unveiling of
the default network, my impulse to announce without even asking him that
Peter Railton and I would write an article about being drawn into the
future, and the Templeton Foundation's jumping in with \$8 million to
support an idea not even half baked.

Finally, the hope circuit. I could not fit the jigsaw puzzle together,
but it emerged out of general anesthesia, a blackout, and an evangelical
memorial service. This was even weirder than the rest. The history of
positive psychology is better described as the alignment of the planets
than as the execution of a plan. I made the right speeches at the right
times, but odd as it sounds, I consistently and completely
underprepared. For the first Nikki speech and my APA presidential
address, and on many other occasions, I waited for the words to come,
and the words came. So what was my role? "Vehicle," "catalyst," and
"attractor" all come to mind. But on my good days, I like to think I was
a "natural." In bridge, as I mentioned, among the high experts a few are
naturals; the cards just fly off their hands, and they cannot always
explain what they did. But their plays are consistently right. Peter
Madison early spotted this in me, and I recognized it---in this case
being a natural was about having good ideas in psychology. From my APA
presidency on, I became a natural inspirer, and I acquired charisma. In
bridge the cards fly off the hands of naturals. The great plays express
the shortcuts the player has built over long experience plus more than
adequate talent, and nothing more. No higher power is at work in bridge.
And I do not intend to invoke a higher power in my life course. But I do
not intend to deny it. The words, nevertheless, were put into my mouth.
THE THEME OF this book will not have escaped you: the trajectory of my

own life and the trajectory of psychology itself are parallel and they
influenced each other. Psychology as I first found it in 1964 had, by
2018, rejected the premises that were blinding it. Psychology is no
longer just about misery. It is about happiness as well. Psychology no
longer disregards natural selection. Psychology no longer uncritically
accepts determinism, that we are frog-marched into the future by our
past, especially by childhood. It is also about how healthy and free
people hope for, plan, and choose among possible futures. Psychology no
longer believes that consciousness is mere froth. It accepts that
conscious thoughts can drive sadness, fear, and anger, as well as joy
and hope. In short, psychology no longer misses everything that makes
life worth living. Psychology, finally, gets it. As do I. How have I
changed from the time of my first academic post

in 1967 until now, and how do these changes parallel the changes in
psychology? I am still an old-fashioned intellectual, and my loyalty
lies with the big questions. But the questions I venture into are bigger
and harder now, with those about creativity and imagination, well-being
and the future of the planet, destiny, time travel, and God coming only
at the end.2 I am a no longer a dedicated skeptic. While still loyal to
the side that needs defenders, I think skepticism is overrated. Science
has its verificationists, the people who work on confirming or
disconfirming others' ideas, but science also needs its question posers,
those who can ask the right question at the right time and then point in
the general direction of a fruitful answer. These people are perhaps
naturals. The sense in which I am still a skeptic is now about science
itself. The human mental apparatus has evolved to solve survival and
reproduction problems. It has not evolved to know the truth or to
perceive ultimate reality. Human beings can know about only the tiniest
edge of what is true. I am still in a bit of a hurry. I want to finish
things, and I still take shortcuts. I am still wrapped up in my own
thoughts, and I still do psychology almost every waking moment. But I do
not know what---if anything---comes next for me, and so I am more
content to polish and rewrite. I am no longer ambitious. I am more
conscious of the awards and honors that I have not gotten than of those
I have. But this is a 4 a.m. annoyance, not a vexation or plague. My big
ambition as an undergraduate was to be like Ludwig Wittgenstein,
surrounded by devoted students and followers. This actually came to pass
and has very much taken the edge off any hunger for prizes. It is a
gratifying state of affairs in the abstract, but it is primarily of
practical importance, because it makes it more likely that my work will
be carried into the next generation. I have acquired some charisma. My
public lectures sometimes are received---to my surprise---with standing
ovations and even sometimes with tears of joy. I had a bit of this as a
young psychologist, but it was just my own enthusiasm that was
contagious. Now the ideas themselves are inspiring. But at seventy-five
I have begun to worry about creeping dementia. I now average thirty
minutes a week trying to find where I parked my car. Dick Solomon swore
me to a secret pact when I was in

my thirties and he was in his sixties. "Marty," he said over scotch at
the faculty club, "I am worried that I am starting to talk rot and that
my lectures are not cutting-edge. The saddest thing about dementia is
that the judgment of capacity deteriorates in lockstep with the
deterioration of that capacity. So as my student and now close colleague
I want you to promise me that if this starts to happen to me, you will
tell me, and then I will shut up and retire." As it happened, Dick died
at age seventy-seven in 1995, before I detected any waning of his
powers. But had I, I would have carried out my promise, and I now need
to find a young colleague to take the pledge for me. I am a leader. Now
less centered on my own agenda, I attend well to the agendas of others.
When I was younger, my advocacy was rightly seen as self-promoting. Now
it is rightly seen as generative. I see the strengths of the colleagues
and students around me and so better guide them toward achieving their
own goals. I can point the way toward new, promising scientific futures,
and I can recruit and mobilize those who will achieve them. I am no
longer negative. I am actually quite positive. I now ask questions about
what is best in life: positive emotion, meaning, human progress, virtue,
and the long future of flourishing. My critical antennae are still up,
but I pay much less attention to their tantrums. I never squash others.
I do not get spontaneously depressed or anxious often---except when a
specific bad event looms. I now have more than my fair share of
contentment. I rate my PERMA very high: on a one-to-ten scale, I rate my
positive emotion a six, my engagement a ten, my relationships a six, my
sense of meaning a ten, and my accomplishment a ten. In 1967, had I
conceived of PERMA, all of my scores would have been much lower. I am
optimistic and usually filled with hope about the future. My personal
life is much better. Mandy brings me joy and inspires my academic life.
I work at home and so am with Mandy and my children almost all day every
day, and they are sunshine. Jenny, the youngest, brightens every single
day for me. About eight years ago, Matthieu Ricard, my friend and a
renowned Buddhist monk, decided to teach loving-kindness mediation to
Tim Beck and to me. We sat with Matthieu in my poker room, and he told
us to imagine someone we loved and then to expand the feeling outward.
Jenny, then age five, happened to walk into the room, and this made the
meditation simple for me. So I

found that loving-kindness meditation worked. Tim thought it was
hogwash. my own life and the change in psychology are intertwined. Both
grew from despair to hope, from darkness, through shadow, toward light.
This is the theme, the very sense, of this book. But a third thing also
happened. The world got better. THE CHANGE IN

The Tiger The setting is no less than the Canterbury Cathedral. I
convened a prospection meeting in October 2014 to consider "being
called." There were about a dozen participants. All of us recognized how
common is the feeling of "calling," but we differed about what it means.
For the secular among us---Amy Wresniewski, Bob Wright, David Yaden,
George Vaillant---the feeling is a mere efflorescence of natural
selection. It is adaptive for the species to undertake visionary
missions and partake of a marching in step that tunes the group. Human
beings have been selected for such spirituality---to think ourselves
part of something larger and more important that we are. This kind of
calling, adaptive as it is, however, is for the secular just a
beneficial illusion. For the divines among us---Hugh Kempster, founder
of Mystics Anonymous; Jonathan Sacks, chief rabbi of England; Kevin
Rudd, prime minister of Australia; Thérèse Rein, former first lady of
Australia and a positive psychologist;

and Theo McCall, exponent of positive Anglicanism---being called is no
illusion. Some people are actually called into the future, by the future
itself or by God. Dreams and visions are mediums of the call. On the
third day, the divines asked, "Why are the pews empty?" In my view the
Christianity of the crucifix, of sin and repentance, is hugely consoling
but thrives best in a world of misery. In a world with less and less
suffering, the crucifix loses much of its appeal. But there is a new,
competing Christianity---a Christianity without the crucifix, a
Christianity of love and gratitude and kindness. The schism in
Anglicanism (and in Catholicism) between South America and Africa, on
the one hand, and Europe and North America, on the other, is exactly
about this. As medical, agricultural, and social progress and a tolerant
diversity continue to relieve misery in the world, a positive
Christianity and a positive Judaism and a positive Islam, I venture,
will thrive. This impulse to build what is positive in life, to raise
temples yet undone, is by no means confined to religion. Our world is
becoming more and more secular, but secular morality and surely our
politics leave a moral vacuum. Toward what does the moral compass point?
In the absence of divine reward or divine instruction, upon what rock
can we justify morality? What principle is grand enough and believable
enough to live one's life around? I believe that the moral compass
points to well-being, in the sense of PERMA, and that this aspiration is
sufficiently grand and believable.3 What does every culture, every
religion, every politics agree upon? What does every parent want for his
or her children? What can almost everyone say yes to? We can all say yes
to more positive emotion. We can all say yes to being more engaged at
work, with those we love, and in leisure. We can all say yes to better
relationships with our fellow human beings, our fellow animals, and our
planet. We can all say yes to more meaning in life. And we can all say
yes to more noble accomplishment. Human history has, until recently,
been a tale of woe: warfare, plague, famine, injustice, poverty,
ignorance, and violent death. The last half century has witnessed, if
not the eradication, a great reduction of these ills. When the world is
a vale of tears, it is natural that politics, religion, science,
medicine, and the arts should concern themselves with defense and
damage. But what happens when the world is no longer a vale of tears?

Florence of the fifteenth century is our beacon: no plague, no famine,
civil harmony, peace, and extraordinary wealth. The city prospers under
the genius of Medici leadership. Cosimo the Elder asks the city to
debate what it should do with its financial surplus, how it should best
use its great good fortune. Florence decides to invest in beauty and
science, creating what two hundred years later we called the
Renaissance. Our world, emerging at last from its vale of tears, now
stands on the brink of a Florentine moment. Until now our
institutions---political, religious, artistic, medical, and
scientific---have seen their mission as reducing misery. They have
succeeded in this laudable mission,4 imperfectly perhaps, but well
enough that we must now ask, "What next?" It is perilously easy to
forget these huge advances and to slip into our glib and quotidian
catastrophizing about what "terrible times" we live in now. I exhort us
to be more fully conscious of these positives, for in their belief that
less suffering was the best we could aspire to, Freud and Schopenhauer
led us into personal, scientific, moral, and political dead ends. We
have much more to aspire to than less suffering. We can also aspire to
more PERMA, more well-being, and more happiness. It is vouchsafed to us
not only to witness the turning of the world but to actually turn the
world toward well-being. We can remake politics, religion, the arts,
medicine, and science into the engines of well-being. an administrator,"
said Serene Jones, president of the Union Theological Seminary, on the
final day of our meeting in the Canterbury Cathedral, "so I have
administrative dreams. "My academic field," Serene continued, "is the
Reformation of the sixteenth century and the subsequent Thirty Years'
War. Once every five hundred years, an idea arises so powerful that it
sweeps away everything. It uproots and then replaces all the old,
entrenched political and religious structures. That the building of
well-being might become the moral touchstone of the way forward is, I
believe, a once-in-five-hundred-years idea." She continued, now
narrating her dream. "I AM

I get a call from the New York City Police. A tiger, they tell me, has
escaped from the Central Park Zoo. So as an administrator, I make sure
the gates of the seminary are closed, the students are up in their dorm,
and the security people are out front. I then get

another call from the police, and they tell me that I will be relieved
to hear that the tiger has been captured. I look up from my desk, and I
see out the window a humongous tiger coming down the hill. It is so
gigantic that it is going to crush the seminary, flat. I feel
expectation and joy and hope. We will go out into the world and plant
gardens and orchards to the horizons, we will build roads through the
mountains and across the deserts, and terrace the mountains and irrigate
the deserts until there will be garden everywhere, and plenty for all,
and there will be no more empires or kingdoms, no more caliphs, sultans,
emirs, khans, or zamindars, no more kings or queens or princes, no more
quadis or mullahs or ulema, no more slavery and no more usury, no more
property and no more taxes, no more rich and no more poor, no killing or
maiming or torture or execution, no more jailers and no more prisoners,
no more generals, soldiers, armies or navies, no more patriarchy, no
more caste, no more hunger, no more suffering than what life brings us
for being born and having to die, and then we will see for the first
time what kind of creatures we really are. ---KIM STANLEY ROBINSON, THE

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This is the easiest acknowledgments section I have ever written, since
the book is peopled by those I want to thank. In addition, and with
respect to writing the book itself, there are several people I want to
single out: Richard Pine, who read a draft biographical chapter and told
me that only I could write deeply on the subject of me. Sam Hughes, who
wrote that original biographical chapter that got me to write it myself.
Sam read and commented helpfully on several early drafts and urged me to
continue on my own. My sister, Beth Brezner, read several drafts, as did
my brother-in-law, Jerry. Beth said he laughed out loud occasionally,
and she corrected numerous errors and reminded me of incidents now
included. Dan Chirot, Bob Kaiser, Doug North, Paul Monaco, Ken Kudon,
Alan Klein, and Jonathon Gordon all sent me corrections and memories of
our schooldays. My oldest child, Amanda Irene Seligman, a skilled editor
in her professional capacity as a historian, read two entire drafts and
commented encouragingly and extensively. Her blue ink far outweighed her
red ink---the best of editorial virtues. George Vaillant read early
parts and applauded loudly, adding energy that kept me going in some
rough spots, as did Senia Maymin, Scott Kaufman, Betty Sue Flowers,
Serene Jones, and Martha Stout (who advised me not to change a single
word). Jeanette Elstein and Peter Schulman helped a great deal in the
gathering and editing of the photos. Ben Adams, my editor, came on
board, and I wrestled him to the ground, whereupon he stood up and was
enormously constructive. Jen Kelland, my copy editor, told me that
reading this book reminded her why she loved her job, and this one
comment made light work of proofing four hundred pages. The love of my
life, Mandy, read every word several times, provided photos, and

Psychology Center, and former president of the American Psychological
Association. Among his thirty books are Learned Optimism and Flourish.

More Advance Praise for The Hope Circuit

"Marty's book is not an autobiography. It's a personalized, guided tour
through the mind and consciousness of genius. I thought I knew my friend
from our many years of association. But not until I read The Hope
Circuit did I really understand how Marty's life is a reflection of the
unimaginable purity of one man's creative and unparalleled intellect."
---Major General Robert Scales (retired) "Here is a major thinker who
sees deeply into human nature and tells a good story. In The Hope
Circuit, Marty Seligman displays both these gifts. This book is his best
writing and thinking yet." ---Angela Duckworth, CEO of the Character Lab
and bestselling author of Grit "Martin Seligman is an intellectual
giant, and readers will look to his memoir The Hope Circuit for secrets
to his phenomenal impact as a scholar. What they will find is a deeply
human story of his own struggles, hopes and ideas, told in an inspiring
way. The Hope Circuit is more than an autobiography; it is handbook for
each of us to build a life dedicated to human flourishing." ---Arthur C.
Brooks, PhD, President of the American Enterprise Institute "The Hope
Circuit is a masterful blend of memoir and recent intellectual
history---specifically, the history of trying to understand how we can
live richer and more meaningful lives. This book could only have been
written by someone who has played a vital role in that inquiry, cares
passionately about it, and has the literary skill to carry that passion
onto the page. The result is a vivid, bracing and sometimes poignant
story of unfolding synergy between a psychologist's life and his work."
---Robert Wright, author of Why Buddhism is True

"For half a century Martin Seligman has enlightened and inspired
students of the human mind with his arresting findings and his visionary
insights. He has been unafraid to plumb the dark recesses of the psyche,
and just as bold in illuminating our better angels. This book combines a
history of psychology by a man who shaped it, an explanation of powerful
ideas about mental life, and a delightfully candid and reflective
memoir." ---Steven Pinker, Johnstone Professor of Psychology, Harvard
University, and the author of How the Mind Works and Enlightenment Now
"In this revealing memoir, the founder of the Positive Psychology
movement recounts the experiences that shaped his work---from early
childhood through his academic studies and research to the present.
Martin Seligman has transformed the field of psychology to the benefit
of all of us. It is fascinating to read the story of how he did that."
---Andrew Weil, MD, author of Spontaneous Happiness and Eight Weeks to
Optimum Health "One of our most important psychologists alive takes us
on a surprising personal journey---through his own highs and lows, twist
and turns, overcoming tremendous obstacles to discover some of the most
groundbreaking and iconic concepts in psychology. For a time his concept
of 'learned helplessness' dominated the field as we looked to undo the
past and now has us looking forward with positive psychology to grow our
resilience, gratitude and hope. If you have an interest in the human
condition, you will love this book." ---John Ratey, author of Spark and
Driven to Distraction "This warm, lively, beautifully written book tells
the stories behind some of the grand ideas and developments that have
reshaped psychology---as well as the struggles, missteps, conflicts, and
misunderstandings that nearly derailed them. Through it all emerges the
author's infectious excitement about exploring the human mind and his
roaming quest for how to make life better for the mass of humanity."
---Roy F. Baumeister, author of Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest
Human Strength

"With a mix of humility and insight, Marty Seligman walks us through the
full arc of his life, offering his theories on tectonic shifts in both
himself and the field of psychology. In The Hope Circuit, Marty uncovers
a view of human nature that is as surprising as it is inspiring. Dive in
for a fascinating disciplinary history seen through the eyes of one of
the most influential psychologists of our time." ---Barbara Fredrickson,
author of Positivity and Love 2.0 "This inspiring and rewarding
well-documented record of a lifetime is a beautifully written
page-turner. In addition, The Hope Circuit is the saga of how American
psychology came of age." ---George E. Vaillant, MD, author of Triumphs
of Experience "Martin Seligman provides a riveting autobiography about
his discovery of 'learned helplessness' and 'positive psychology' with
The Hope Circuit. Interwoven within the carefully scripted storytelling,
Seligman takes the reader in a journey of self and intellectual
discovery that explains why he is one of intellectual icons of our
times. Woven throughout is a story of discovery, resilience, passion,
and drive to not only understand self but to understand and remedy the
maladies of life. The 2017 recipient of the prestigious American
Psychological Association's Lifetime Achievement Award employs a unique,
simultaneous combination of both fast reading and soul-scratching to
deliver a timely and critical message of hope." ---Antonio Puente,
President of the American Psychological Association "The Hope Circuit is
riveting. It turns out that one of the greatest psychologists of all
time is also one of our greatest storytellers. Offering an unparalleled
glimpse into a particular time and place and history of science, Marty
Seligman's book will entertain you, fascinate you, disabuse you, and
move you. Along with Marty, you will laugh, grieve, and rage and,
alighting on the last page, insist on a sequel." ---Sonja Lyubomirsky,
Ph. D., professor of psychology at the University of California,
Riverside, and author of The How of Happiness: A Scientific Approach to
Getting the Life You Want

"Martin Seligman has written a fascinating and intimate portrait of both
his own life and the discipline of psychology. A deeply gifted scholar,
practitioner and communicator, he reminds us that positive psychology
has profound implications for the way we live and work---and for public
policy. Through his unique insights, relentless work ethic and
infectious enthusiasm, Marty has helped many children and adults around
the world ---and especially in Australia---live more engaged, happy and
meaningful lives. For that we should be most grateful." ---The Honorable
Kevin Rudd, 26th Prime Minister of Australia "Martin Seligman is simply
the most important and influential psychologist of the last 30 years.
This stunning memoir will tell you why, and reading it will change your
life for the better." ---Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the
University of Buckingham "This valuable memoir reveals how an
influential new approach in psychology is intertwined with the life
story of its leader." ---Howard Gardner, Hobbs Professor of Cognition
and Education at Harvard University and author of Multiple Intelligences
"The positive psychology movement is a beacon of hope in our
contemporary culture. Its founder, Martin Seligman, is one of today's
most influential psychologists. In this book, he tells his remarkable
journey---from studying failure to promoting human flourishing. It is a
fascinating story." ---Richard Layard, Director of the Well-Being
Program at the London School of Economics "In my life, Martin Seligman
rapidly evolved from just brilliant scientist, to become my good friend
and mentor after we started the Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program in
2008. This book, The Hope Circuit, which is both entertaining and
refreshingly honest, helps me understand how he become the scientist,
visionary and patriot I met and admire today." ---Rhonda Cornum,
Brigadier General (retired), PhD, MD, and Director of Health Strategy
for TechWerks

"There are only a handful of living psychologists who would be worthy of
an autobiography. Martin Seligman is one of that handful---one of the
very most eminent psychologists alive today. Seligman's life and career
are both models for how one can find meaning in life. Seligman not only
reminds us of the tremendous positive impact he has had---through his
studies of learned helplessness, depression, and positive psychology---
but also of how even the greatest of professionals must overcome the
many obstacles strewn in their path. Seligman shows that greatness does
not derive from a life without obstacles, but rather from viewing those
obstacles as challenges and learning experiences. He demonstrates how he
and anyone else can meet challenges in life to reach ever-growing
heights not despite the challenges, but often, because of them. This is
a wonderful story masterfully told." ---Robert J. Sternberg, Professor
of Human Development, Cornell University "The Hope Circuit is a
remarkable blend of personal growth and scientific discovery. Seligman
is one of the giants of science and in this treatise he bares his sole
as to how he came to the revelations that have so changed the field.
Preparedness, safety signal, learned helplessness, and positive
psychology are among the most original and important contributions to
psychology in the last half century. The treatise reads as a character
study and as a road map for how to do science and it is always
fascinating and illuminating." ---Steven Hollon, Gertrude Conaway
Vanderbilt Professor of Psychology, Vanderbilt University "Martin
Seligman is renowned for his contribution to the field of positive
psychology---and in this thought-provoking and surprisingly candid
memoir, he explains how hard-won his wisdom has been." ---Gretchen
Rubin, author of The Happiness Project and The Four Tendencies

    with this essay, with one

exception: Layard argues that happiness, subjective well-being, is the
unitary measure of the aim of secular ethics. I believe it is but that
PERMA, which is broader and combines objective measures with subjective
measures, is the path to happiness. 4. I must again recommend Johan
