Designing a Multi-Level Personality Profiling Engine for SoulAI Building
SoulAI's capability to silently learn about its user and make better
match recommendations requires a structured, top-down approach to
personality profiling. Below we outline the key components and levels of
this system, how they feed into compatibility matching, and important
implementation and policy considerations.

Silent Background Learning Engine The first pillar is a silent learning
engine that operates in the background of every chat session. This
engine should analyze each user message in real-time and update an
internal user profile without alerting the user. The goal is to keep
conversations natural and not make the user feel "watched," while still
extracting useful personality signals. Key characteristics of this
engine include: â€¢ Passive Analysis of Messages: As the user chats with
SoulAI, the engine parses language for personality cues (e.g.Â word
choice, tone, topics) and infers traits or preferences in the background
1 . Advanced NLP techniques or LLM-based classifiers can detect Big Five
traits from text with reasonable accuracy 1 . For example, using
transformer models or linguistic cue analysis can help identify if a
user leans introverted vs.Â extroverted, or scores high in openness,
etc., based on how they communicate 2 1 . Over time, this builds a rich
profile without a formal questionnaire. â€¢ Natural Conversation Flow: The
engine must never surface its observations directly to the user during
chat. SoulAI should respond in a personable way, not like it's filling
out a survey. This means the learning is truly silent. The user may be
informed outside the chat (e.g.Â in a consent screen or privacy policy)
that the AI learns from their inputs, but the chatbot's dialogue
shouldn't reveal "I've noted you are X personality." This ensures the
user doesn't feel scrutinized and can open up organically, which in turn
provides more authentic data for the engine to learn from. â€¢ Gradual
Progressive Profiling: It's wise to implement progressive profiling --
gradually building the profile across many conversations rather than
trying to deduce everything at once 3 . In early interactions, the
engine might focus on obvious, high-level traits; in later interactions,
it can refine deeper nuances. This avoids overwhelming the user with
personal questions. As VentureBeat notes, a good bot accumulates
knowledge over time instead of forcing a "big bang" info dump up front 3
. By conversation 1--5, SoulAI might only determine broad personality
type; by conversations 6--15, it might start inferring values and
philosophies, and so on (more on phases below). â€¢ Not Creepy or
Intrusive: It's important to maintain a fine line between smart
profiling and feeling "creepy." The bot should never overstep by prying
for personal info unnaturally. It should also avoid actions like
accessing contacts or personal files without clear purpose 4 . In
practice, this means SoulAI sticks to analyzing what the user
voluntarily shares in chat, and possibly asking subtle, contextually
relevant questions to clarify personality hints (e.g.Â "Do you like being
the center of attention at parties?" if it flows in conversation, to
gauge introversion). Even

1

these should feel like friendly interest, not interrogation. Bots that
exploit user data or obviously harvest info break user trust 4 , so
SoulAI's learning engine must remain discreet and respectful. By
establishing a silent learning engine with these principles, SoulAI sets
the foundation for understanding its user in depth while keeping the
user experience comfortable.

ðŸ“Š Six-Level Personality Profiling Framework To systematically capture a
user's essence, we propose a 6-level personality profile hierarchy. This
topdown framework starts with broad traits and drills down into finer
nuances. Each level covers aspects crucial for romantic compatibility: â€¢
Level 1: Core Personality Type (MBTI, Big Five, Attachment Style). At
the highest level, SoulAI identifies the user's personality type using
established models. This includes the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
or similar 16 Personalities type, the Big Five trait scores (OCEAN:
Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism),
and the user's attachment style in relationships (secure, anxious,
avoidant, or mix). These frameworks give an initial sketch of who the
user is: â€¢ MBTI: Placing the user among the 16 types (e.g.Â ENFP, ISTJ,
etc.) provides a shorthand of their preferences (Introvert/Extravert,
Intuitive/Sensing, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Perceiving). We can
leverage resources like 16Personalities -- which offers research-backed
profiles for each type, including how those personalities tend to behave
in work, friendship, and love 5 . By augmenting the AI model with
knowledge from such profiles, SoulAI can more accurately classify the
user's type and understand typical strengths/weaknesses of that type in
relationships 5 . â€¢ Big Five: Unlike MBTI, Big Five gives continuous
trait dimensions. The learning engine can infer approximate Big Five
scores by looking at language patterns. (For example, high Extraversion
might correlate with frequent social references or enthusiastic tone,
while high Neuroticism might show in expressions of anxiety or emotional
fluctuations 2 .) Inferring Big Five helps in compatibility because
research indicates similarity (or complementarity) in these fundamental
traits can affect relationship satisfaction 6 . â€¢ Attachment Style: The
engine should watch for clues about how the user bonds or handles
intimacy. Do they express anxiety about being abandoned (hints of
anxious attachment) or a strong need for independence (avoidant
attachment)? Attachment style profoundly influences relationship
dynamics. For instance, a pairing of one anxious and one avoidant
partner can create a "push-pull" dynamic that is notoriously challenging
7 . Knowing a user's style (and maybe their past patterns like "I get
clingy" or "I struggle to open up") will be important for matching them
with someone compatible or complementary. Ideally, SoulAI would aim to
match users in a way that avoids extremely incompatible attachment
combinations (or at least be aware of the potential challenges). â€¢ Level
2: Core Values and Life Philosophy. Beyond raw personality metrics,
SoulAI should profile the user's beliefs, values, and outlook on life.
This includes moral and spiritual beliefs, life priorities, and what
they find most important (family, career, adventure, security, etc.).
Shared core values are often cited as a foundation of long-term
compatibility -- couples who align on bigpicture beliefs tend to have
more enduring, satisfying relationships 8 . The learning engine can
gather this by noting any value-laden statements the user makes. For
example, if the user frequently mentions environmentalism, religion,
political views, or philosophies (like "I believe everything happens for
a reason" or "Honesty is the most important thing"), these should be
logged. Over multiple chats, SoulAI will accumulate a picture of the
user's guiding principles:

2

â€¢ Does the user value family and tradition, or are they more independent
and unconventional? â€¢ Are they ambitious and career-driven or laid-back,
prioritizing work-life balance? â€¢ How do they view topics like money,
charity, spirituality, or personal growth? Knowing these helps SoulAI
recommend partners who either share those values (for harmony) or at
least can respect them. Studies confirm that aligned core values
strengthen relationships, improving trust and conflict resolution 9 10 .
â€¢ Level 3: Communication and Behavior Patterns. SoulAI should observe
how the user communicates and behaves in conversation. Everyone has a
communication style -- some are very direct and blunt, others are polite
and diplomatic; some use humor and sarcasm frequently, others are
serious; some are highly verbose, others succinct. This level includes:
â€¢ Conversation style: Does the user tend to lead the conversation or
follow? Are they more assertive or passive, formal or casual,
affectionate or reserved in word choice? Do they ask questions showing
interest in others or mostly talk about themselves? These patterns
influence how they'll interact with a partner. For instance, two people
who are both very passive communicators might struggle to progress,
whereas one talkative and one more reserved person could balance each
other. â€¢ Conflict and social behavior: If disagreements or sensitive
topics arise, does the user respond calmly, or get heated? Do they use
polite language even when upset or resort to insults? Do they apologize
and empathize, or deflect and joke? These behaviors give insight into
their emotional maturity and conflict resolution style. They may not all
emerge early, but over time SoulAI might pick up on how the user handles
minor frustrations (even within the AI chat). â€¢ Habits and routines
mentioned: For example, if the user often mentions staying up late
gaming vs.Â waking up early to exercise -- these are lifestyle behaviors
but also reflect personality (discipline, introversion, etc.). This
overlaps with Level 5 (lifestyle), but here the focus is on how they act
and talk day-to-day. By compiling these communication traits, SoulAI can
better match someone who meshes well. (For instance, pairing a person
who appreciates gentle, empathetic communication with someone known for
tact and empathy.) â€¢ Level 4: Emotional Intelligence and Triggers. This
level delves into the user's emotional profile: â€¢ Emotional intelligence
(EQ): Does the user exhibit empathy, self-awareness, and good emotional
regulation? High-EQ individuals might articulate their feelings clearly
or demonstrate understanding of others' feelings. Those lacking EQ might
frequently misread situations or show poor coping (e.g.Â lashing out or
stonewalling when upset). Recognizing this is key because higher
emotional intelligence has a strong positive correlation with healthier,
more stable relationships 11 . If SoulAI senses the user is very
emotionally tuned (or not), it could weigh compatibility with partners
accordingly (e.g.Â two highly emotionally intelligent people may handle
conflicts better together, whereas a mismatch in EQ could cause
frustration). â€¢ Emotional triggers and sensitivities: The engine should
note if certain topics make the user uncomfortable or upset. For
example, if the user's tone shifts when discussing family, that might be
a sensitive area. Or perhaps criticism about their work triggers
defensiveness. Such insights help in two ways: (1) SoulAI can avoid
unnecessarily pushing those buttons in conversation, and (2) when
matching, it can either find a partner whose personality can navigate
those triggers or who shares similar sensitivities. Knowing someone's
trigger (say, they hate silent treatment due to abandonment fears) means
SoulAI would prefer matches who are communicative and reassuring rather
than aloof types.

3

â€¢ Attachment-related behaviors: This ties back to Level 1's attachment
style but on a behavioral level -- e.g., if the user shows clinginess or
jealousy easily in hypothetical scenarios, that signals anxious
tendencies; if they avoid discussing feelings, that signals avoidant
tendencies. These emotional behaviors significantly shape relationship
patterns. â€¢ Level 5: Lifestyle Preferences and Interests. Here SoulAI
compiles the user's day-to-day lifestyle, hobbies, and interests: â€¢
Interests and passions: What does the user enjoy doing or talking about?
This could be hobbies (sports, art, gaming, travel, etc.), favorite
music or movies, love for pets, etc. Common interests are classic
matchmaking fodder -- people bond over shared hobbies and activities. In
fact, having overlapping interests can improve relationship satisfaction
by giving couples enjoyable activities to share 6 . SoulAI should keep a
list of top interests the user mentions or seems excited about. â€¢
Lifestyle and habits: Are they an outdoorsy adventurer or a homebody? Do
they prefer a structured routine or a spontaneous lifestyle? Clues
include statements like "I go hiking every weekend" (active lifestyle)
vs.Â "I mostly binge Netflix after work" (more home-oriented). Other
lifestyle aspects: nightlife (does the user party or drink often or are
they sober/low-key?), fitness (gym every day vs.Â not into exercise),
diet (vegan, foodie, etc.), travel (love traveling vs.Â rarely travels),
etc. These everyday preferences will heavily determine compatibility
when two people try to share a life. For example, matching a person who
loves camping and unplugging with someone who hates the outdoors could
cause friction unless they're very compromising. SoulAI should aim to
match people with reasonably compatible lifestyles or at least inform
the compatibility score if there's a stark mismatch. â€¢ Social life: Does
the user prefer spending weekends with large groups of friends or quiet
time alone? This overlaps with the introversion/extraversion trait but
is more concrete -- e.g., if one user is very social and the other is
very solitary, both should be aware of that dynamic if matched. Many
dating apps explicitly ask about lifestyle choices (smoking, drinking,
etc.) for this reason; here the AI might infer some of it from context.
In summary, aligning lifestyles and sharing key interests can greatly
enhance a couple's day-to-day harmony 6 . SoulAI will use this level to
boost matches where lifestyle convergence is high. â€¢ Level 6:
Relationship Patterns and Goals. Finally, the deepest level is
understanding the user's relationship history, patterns, and future
goals: â€¢ Past relationship patterns: If the user volunteers information
about past relationships (e.g.Â "I tend to get bored after 3 months" or
"My last partner said I was too work-focused"), SoulAI should note these
recurring themes. Do they have a history of short flings or long
commitments? Any red flags or lessons learned they mention? For
instance, if a user recognizes "I have trouble with trust because of a
bad breakup," that's crucial data. These patterns help predict what kind
of partner might suit them or what pitfalls to avoid. Two people with
complementary patterns could help each other (one's patience balancing
the other's anxiety, etc.), whereas two people with the same negative
pattern might reinforce it. â€¢ Relationship goals and intentions: This
includes what the user is looking for now and longterm. Are they seeking
a serious long-term relationship (marriage, kids) or something casual?
Do they express a timeline (e.g.Â wanting to settle down soon
vs.Â focusing on career first)? Ensuring alignment on major relationship
goals is vital -- mismatches here (say one wants kids and the other
doesn't) are often deal-breakers. SoulAI should glean this from things
the user says like "I'm just here for fun" or "Ultimately I want to find
someone to spend my life with." It might also pick up implicit hints (if
the user frequently talks about wanting a family, or conversely, values
freedom and doesn't mention family at all).

4

â€¢ Compatibility nuances: This level can also capture any specific
"must-haves" or "can't-stands" the user reveals regarding partners. For
example, "I could never date a smoker" or "I really want a partner who
shares my faith" are explicit criteria. SoulAI can treat these as
critical filters in matching. Likewise, if a user says "I always end up
with people who don't respect my boundaries," SoulAI should try to match
them with someone who (based on that person's profile) is respectful and
communicative. In essence, Level 6 synthesizes everything into an
understanding of what the user needs in a relationship. It combines who
they are (Levels 1--5) with what they seek or should avoid. By filling
out all six levels, SoulAI builds a comprehensive personality and
compatibility profile for the user. Each level informs a different
aspect of match compatibility, which leads to the next component: how to
use this profile to match SoulAI's user with others.

Compatibility Matching and SoulAI-to-SoulAI Interaction Once SoulAI has
robust profiles for its users, the next challenge is matching them
effectively. This involves a multi-dimensional comparison of two users'
profiles and possibly a simulation of their interaction: â€¢
Multi-Dimensional Compatibility Scoring: SoulAI should calculate a
compatibility score that weighs all the profile levels discussed. This
is essentially a weighted algorithm that takes into account: â€¢
Personality type synergy: How well do the two users' core personalities
align? For MBTI, some combinations are traditionally considered
harmonious and others more challenging. In fact, some systems assign
match scores for all 16Ã—16 MBTI combinations based on psychology
research and counseling practices 12 . SoulAI could incorporate such a
matrix -- for example, pairing two intuitive-feeling types (NF) might
yield a higher base score than pairing an extreme introvert with an
extreme extrovert who have radically different needs. The SoulSync app
implemented this by using research-backed match ratings for each MBTI
pair 12 . â€¢ Big Five trait alignment: Compare their Big Five profiles --
generally, similarity in certain traits (or complementarity if a trait
is beneficial in opposite, like one high in conscientiousness to
organize and one slightly lower to be flexible) can affect
compatibility. Studies have found that personality trait similarity and
shared interests are strong predictors of relationship satisfaction 6 .
For example, if both score high on Agreeableness, conflicts may be
smoother; if one is extremely Neurotic and the other extremely
Emotionally Stable, that could either balance or cause empathy gaps. The
algorithm might assign sub-scores for each trait difference. â€¢
Attachment style pairing: SoulAI should factor in how their attachment
styles might interact. The ideal is often at least one partner (or both)
with secure attachment. Two insecure styles together (especially
anxious + avoidant) may reduce the compatibility score unless other
factors mitigate it. If SoulAI detects one user is anxious and the other
is very reassuring/communicative by nature, that could be a workable
pair; but an anxious with a highly avoidant might be flagged as lower
compatibility due to the likely "push-pull" conflict 7 . â€¢ Values and
life goals alignment: A high weight should be given to core values
matching. For instance, if both value family and community highly,
that's a plus; if one values personal freedom above all and the other
values tradition and settling down, that mismatch could seriously affect
long-term prospects. The algorithm can check for any deal-breaker
clashes (like fundamentally different religions or one person adamantly
wants kids vs.Â the other absolutely doesn't). Major goal alignment (both
want marriage eventually, or both are okay with a casual relationship)
also heavily influences the score. In essence, shared values and
mutually compatible goals create a stable foundation 8 , so the scoring
should reward that.

5

â€¢ Communication style fit: The compatibility calculation can also
consider how their interaction might play out given their communication
patterns. For example, will one person's style offend or overwhelm the
other? If one is extremely blunt and the other extremely sensitive, that
could be a risk to compatibility unless moderated. Alternatively, if
both have similar styles (e.g., both are highly communicative and
emotionally open), that's likely positive. Some of this might be hard to
quantify, but SoulAI could use proxy indicators (like if both have high
emotional intelligence and agreeable communication, high score; if one
is high in agreeableness and the other very low, lower score due to
potential friction). â€¢ Interests and lifestyle overlap: SoulAI should
boost the score if the two users share key interests or lifestyle
choices. Common hobbies (both love hiking or both are into the same
music) will give them more to bond over. A lifestyle match (both are
night owls who enjoy vibrant social lives, or both prefer quiet nights
and early mornings) also improves day-to-day compatibility. The engine
might represent this as an "interests similarity" sub-score, for which
one can use techniques like embedding vectors of listed hobbies to see
how close they are 13 . For example, SoulSync's system used embeddings
for hobbies to quantify shared interests similarity 13 . Two users with
very divergent lifestyles (say one is a globetrotter and the other never
travels, or one very sporty and the other very sedentary) could still
match, but SoulAI might warn or account for the compromises needed. â€¢
Relationship outlook: Finally, compare their relationship goals and
patterns. If both are looking for the same thing (long-term vs
short-term), that's essential. Also, consider complementing each other's
needs -- e.g., if one expressed needing a patient partner because they
are anxious, and the other's profile suggests high patience and
understanding, that's a strong match indicator. Conversely, mismatches
like one person who needs a lot of affirmation paired with someone who
is emotionally distant would lower the score. The result of all these
factors can be a composite compatibility percentage or rating.
Importantly, this algorithm can be tuned with weights on each aspect.
Likely, some factors (core values, relationship goals) should weigh
heavier than others (like a hobby in common), because a difference in
favorite music is easier to overcome than a difference in wanting kids.
The weights can start with educated guesses and then be refined via user
feedback or known research. For instance, SoulSync weighted personality
traits and interests strongly based on research that those predict
satisfaction 6 , and cited MBTI counseling literature for those
weightings 14 . We should do similarly: base weights on relationship
psychology findings where possible. â€¢ SoulAI-to-SoulAI "Match Preview"
(Simulated Interaction): A novel and powerful feature to consider is
having SoulAI agents for each user communicate with each other to test
compatibility. Essentially, when two users are candidate matches, their
respective SoulAI personas (which know their users' profile well) could
engage in a simulated mini-conversation. This could reveal the dynamic
between the two personalities. If the conversation flows easily, shares
lots of common ground, or shows cute chemistry, that's a positive sign.
If it quickly falls flat or one bot detects points of tension, that
might indicate lower real-life rapport. This concept is not science
fiction -- for example, the Teaser AI dating app allows users to train
AI bots with their personality traits, and when two users match, the AI
bots have a simulated conversation to give a preview of potential
interactions 15 . SoulAI could implement a similar approach: essentially
let the AI versions of two users "chat" about a few topics (perhaps
exchanging questions the real users have discussed with SoulAI in the
past, like hobbies or opinions). The outcome (was the tone friendly? Did
they find common interests? Any awkward silences?) can feed into the
compatibility score or at least be presented as insight. This adds an
extra layer beyond static profile data -- it tests chemistry. It's like
a virtual first date between AI proxies. Of course, this should be done
carefully and likely only once a certain threshold of profile
completeness is met (so the bots have enough to talk about). If
implemented, it should remain an internal tool or a

6

fun feature (some apps show users a snippet of their bots' chat as a
gimmick). It's important to manage user expectations -- an AI-simulated
chat isn't destiny, but it can highlight likely points of connection or
friction. â€¢ Compatibility Report: For transparency (if desired), SoulAI
could generate a brief report or rationale for each match
recommendation, summarizing why it thinks the two people might click.
For example: "You both are ENFP types who love creative pursuits and
value family -- plus, your conversation styles are very open and
humorous, which could make for great chemistry!" This would use the
profile data to explain the match in human terms. However, whether this
is shown to users or just used internally is a product decision. Some
users might appreciate the insight, others might find it too analytical.
Regardless, having this internally helps debug the matching algorithm
and ensure it aligns with human intuition. In summary, compatibility
matching in SoulAI will be a multi-factor analysis combining personality
theory and data-driven insights. By considering all six profile levels,
SoulAI can move beyond superficial matchmaking and truly pair users who
align on deeper levels. The inclusion of SoulAI-to-SoulAI simulated
interactions can further refine matches by testing conversation
chemistry in advance 15 .

Persistent Profile Storage and Learning Over Time To make this system
effective, SoulAI must remember and refine the user's profile over time.
Key implementation points for data persistence and continuous learning:
â€¢ Local Profile Database: Each user's profile (the 6-level data and any
scores/flags) should be stored securely, likely as a structured object
or database entry. You mentioned using AsyncStorage (for a React Native
app, for example) to save data locally on the device. Storing the
profile locally has privacy advantages (data stays with the user) and
allows the AI to quickly reference past info even if the conversation
context window is limited. This persistent memory ensures that insights
from conversation #1 are still known in conversation #50, even if the AI
model itself has a short memory. Whenever SoulAI's learning engine
updates something (say it raises the confidence that the user is an
Introvert), it should write that to storage. â€¢ Cloud vs Local
Considerations: If matchmaking involves comparing profiles between
users, eventually some data will likely need to go to a server or at
least be shared in aggregated form. One approach is to keep each user's
detailed profile local for privacy, but send only the necessary
compatibility-relevant data to a server when looking for matches (for
example, send a "match request" that contains the user's key traits or
an anonymized version of their profile to compute matches). This way,
sensitive raw conversation data never leaves the device -- only the
distilled traits. Regardless, wherever the profile is stored, ensure
it's encrypted and protected, as it contains personal information
(essentially a psychological profile of the user). â€¢ Confidence Scoring
and Update Mechanism: As mentioned, the engine should maintain a
confidence level for each inferred trait or fact. Early on, everything
is a tentative guess. For example, after 2 chats, SoulAI might be 60%
confident the user is an Introvert (based on limited evidence). It
should mark that and perhaps hold off on firmly declaring the user "I"
in MBTI until confidence is higher (or continue to subtly test it). Each
new message or conversation provides more data points to either
reinforce or adjust these inferences. Implementing a decay or
reinforcement algorithm is useful. Essentially, this is similar to how a
human impression might evolve -- the AI should be able to say, "I
initially thought you were type X, but new info suggests Y, so I'll
shift." In code, you might update trait scores probabilistically or with
weights that converge as evidence grows. In research on chatbot user
profiling, techniques like gradually reducing weight

7

given to new data as the profile stabilizes have been used 16 17 --
meaning early messages can swing the profile more, but once there's lots
of data, each new message only fine-tunes it slightly. Designing such an
update function will prevent the profile from jittering too wildly on
small inputs while still allowing learning. â€¢ Progressive Enrichment by
Phases: You outlined a phase-wise approach which makes sense: â€¢ Phase 1
(Conversations 1--5): Basic Personality ID. In this phase, focus on
nailing down Level 1 traits (MBTI, Big Five tendencies, attachment
hints) and any glaring value or lifestyle points the user explicitly
mentions. The AI is mostly getting the "broad strokes" of who this
person is. â€¢ Phase 2 (Conversations 6--15): Values and Deeper Traits. As
the user grows comfortable, they might reveal more personal stories or
opinions. SoulAI can start confidently mapping Level 2 and 3 --
identifying core values, communication style patterns, etc. By now
there's enough interaction history to spot recurring themes (e.g.Â "User
often talks about creative projects -- values creativity and
self-expression"). â€¢ Phase 3 (Conversations 16--30): Behavioral Patterns
& Emotional Insights. At this stage, the AI has seen the user in varied
moods and topics. It can infer Level 4 (emotional intelligence, typical
emotional responses) more reliably. It might also know some relationship
history by now if the user has shared. The profile gets richer with
subtle nuances -- perhaps detecting humor style, conflict approach, etc.
â€¢ Phase 4 (Conversations 31+): Deep Relationship Insights. Over a long
period, SoulAI should have a well-rounded view and can update Level 5
and 6 details. Maybe the user eventually shares past relationship
anecdotes, or explicitly states what they want in a partner after
gaining trust in the AI. By now the SoulAI could practically "predict"
what kind of person would complement them, based on everything learned.
These phases are not strict cut-offs but guidelines. The main idea is
don't rush it -- prioritize building trust and let information flow
naturally. This phased approach also aligns with user engagement: the
more they chat, the smarter recommendations get, which incentivizes
continued use. â€¢ Learning Across Sessions: Ensure that the profile
persists across app sessions (if the user closes the app and returns
next week, SoulAI should remember them exactly as they left off). This
sounds obvious, but it means implementing proper caching or database
usage rather than relying on the AI model's short-term memory. If using
an AI API (like GPT-4 via OpenAI), you'll want to feed the model the
user's profile from storage at the start of a new session (to give it
context on the user's personality) -- effectively a dynamic prompt that
includes known user traits (this stays hidden from the user). This can
allow SoulAI's responses to be better personalized in tone and content.
â€¢ Feedback Loop and Adjustment: Over time, the AI can also verify its
inferences by subtle feedback loops. For example, if SoulAI predicted
the user hates spontaneity, it might casually mention something like
"Surprises can be fun sometimes" and see the user's reaction. If the
user strongly disagrees, that reinforces the inference. If they actually
agree, the AI might adjust its assumption. Another method is to
occasionally ask the user reflective questions (in a natural way) like
"So what do you value most in life?" -- doubling as engaging
conversation and profile validation. Because the AI should not
explicitly say it's profiling, these questions need to feel like normal
friendly questions. Done sparingly, it can improve accuracy. By
implementing persistent and evolving user profiles, SoulAI ensures it
learns continuously and becomes more accurate with each chat. This
persistent knowledge will make match recommendations increasingly "spot
on" as the AI accumulates a history with the user.

8

Implementation Roadmap and Next Steps Given this plan, it's important to
execute in a sensible order that prioritizes core functionality and user
experience. Here are the recommended next steps: 1. Design the Profile
Schema and Database: Start by formally defining how you will represent
the user profile data for all six levels. For instance, create a
structure (JSON or database schema) with fields for MBTI type (plus a
confidence score), Big Five trait scores, a list of core values,
attachment style, key interests, etc. You might also include sub-scores
like "communication_style: analytical vs emotional" or "humor: 7/10" --
whatever metrics you think you'll capture. Planning this schema early
ensures that as you build the learning engine, you know exactly where to
record insights. It also helps in designing the compatibility algorithm.
Decide which parts are stored locally (likely all, for privacy) and how
they will be retrieved for matching. If using AsyncStorage for a React
Native mobile app, outline the keys and JSON structure for storing the
profile. 2. Build the Silent Learning Engine (Phase 1 functionality):
Implement the SoulAILearningEngine.analyzeMessage(userMessage, history)
method. Initially, this can be rule-based or heuristic-driven for
simplicity. For example: 3. If a message contains certain keywords or
sentiment, update relevant traits (e.g., "I feel so energized after
hanging out with friends all weekend" -\> indicates extraversion; the
engine adds +1 to an extraversion score). 4. Use NLP techniques: you
might integrate a pre-trained sentiment analyzer or personality analysis
library to get Big Five estimates from text. There are research
libraries and even some open-source models for personality detection.
For a start, even counting Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)
categories could yield clues (e.g., use of first-person pronouns
vs.Â secondperson can correlate with certain traits). 5. If the user
explicitly describes themselves ("I am a very organized person" or "I'm
an INFJ"), the engine should directly record that (self-reported data is
valuable -- though sometimes users misjudge themselves, it's still a
data point). 6. Implement simple parsing for factual nuggets (if user
shares birthdate, job, etc., though those might not be directly needed
for compatibility, except age perhaps to ensure appropriate matching).
7. Structure this analysis function so that it updates the profile
object in memory and then persists it via AsyncStorage. Focus on making
this pipeline work end-to-end: from incoming message -\> analysis -\>
profile update -\> saved. Test it with example inputs. At first, it
might use very naive rules, but that's okay. You can improve the
analysis granularity over time (even consider fine-tuning an LLM on
personality classification down the road, but start simple). This engine
is the heartbeat of SoulAI's personalization, so get a basic version
running early. 1. Implement the Compatibility Scoring Function: Parallel
to or right after the learning engine, you can set up the skeleton for
comparing two profiles ( generateCompatibilityScore(profile1, profile2)
). Even if your trait extraction is rudimentary at first, decide how to
calculate a score from whatever data is available: 2. For now, you might
hard-code weightings: e.g., "if MBTI exists for both, look up a
compatibility rating from a table (perhaps start with a simplified
logic, like give +10 if one's type is typically good with the other).
Add/subtract points for Big Five differences (maybe using a simple
difference formula for each trait). Add points for each shared interest.
Subtract points for any

major value clashes that you detect (you could maintain a list of "red
flag" opposites, like one is "very religious" and another "strong
atheist" could be a clash)." This initial algorithm can be rudimentary,
but have it in place. Use test profiles to see if it produces intuitive
results (e.g., identical profiles = high score, very opposite in
everything = low score). 3. Design the output: not just a numeric score,
but possibly a breakdown (like a structure containing "match_score: 78,
highlights: \[common_interest_music, both_introverts,
value_alignment_high\], issues: \[distance_in_extraversion,
different_relationship_goals\]"). This could be used to generate a nice
explanation for the match later. 4. Consider leveraging existing data if
available: The 16Personalities site or MBTI literature might have
qualitative compatibility notes (e.g., "ENFP tends to get along with
INTJ and INFJ" etc.). You could encode some of those rules into your
algorithm for a starting point. And as seen with SoulSync, there's
mention of 256 MBTI combination scores 12 -- you might not have that
data immediately, but even a simple scheme like "same MBTI temperament
(NJ, SP, etc.) + some points; same dominant function + some points"
could suffice initially. 5. Plan to refine this as your profiling gets
more accurate. This function will evolve as you gather real user data
and feedback on which matches actually work well. 6. Create the User
Onboarding & Consent Flow: Before deploying any of this, you need to
handle the ethical and legal side. As you noted, you'll require user
consent to build a profile from their messages. Design a brief
onboarding screen or terms of service that clearly (but not alarmingly)
explains: "This app uses an AI that learns from your chat to improve
match recommendations. Your data is private and is only used to help
find compatible partners. By proceeding, you agree to this personalized
profiling." Make it user-friendly and transparent. Perhaps give an
option to opt-out of profiling if someone is uncomfortable (though that
would limit functionality -- but as a privacy principle, it's good to
offer). Ensure this appears before the user really starts chatting, so
you have their informed consent from the start. 7. Also, implement a way
for users to reset or delete their profile if they wish (in account
settings, "wipe my data" option). This aligns with best practices (and
laws like GDPR) allowing users to control their data. If a user resets,
SoulAI should treat them like a new user with no history. 8. Mention in
the privacy policy how the data is stored (if solely on device,
emphasize that for reassurance; if on servers, explain security
measures). Given you plan local AsyncStorage, you can say "The profile
stays on your device" -- which many will appreciate. 9. Also clarify
that the profile is based only on what the user shares (so it might not
be a complete picture, and that's okay). 10. Replicate relevant parts of
OpenAI's and other AI services' privacy approaches: For instance,
OpenAI's policy emphasizes that they don't build personal user profiles
for advertising or sell data 18 . You too should commit that the data is
used only internally for matching and improving user experience, not for
third-party ads or anything. Security & confidentiality are crucial
since users are effectively sharing personal thoughts with the AI. 11.
Integrate Personality Knowledge (16Personalities and Beyond): Augment
your AI's brain with domain knowledge about personality types. This
could be done in a few ways: 12. Fine-tune or prompt-train the AI on
descriptions from the 16Personalities site. For example, you could
create prompts like: "If a user is classified as \[Type\], these are
their likely traits, communication style, strengths, weaknesses, and
ideal partners..." using the site's content as a base (respecting any
usage rights -- if it's public info, use it carefully). This will help
SoulAI make educated guesses. For instance, if SoulAI tentatively thinks
the user is an INTJ and it has the

10

16Personalities INTJ profile in its knowledge, it will know INTJs can be
analytical, reserved, value competence, and often pair well with ENFP or
ENTJ types in theory 5 . It can then look for evidence to confirm INTJ
and also keep an eye out for matches with complementary types. 13.
Similarly, incorporate knowledge of attachment theory (what behaviors
correspond to anxious vs secure, etc.), love languages, and any other
psychological models that might enhance understanding of relationships.
14. Basically, you want SoulAI to have a framework for interpreting the
raw data. The better its baseline knowledge, the more accurate its
inferences from user messages will be. Using wellestablished personality
theories and even pop psychology (like MBTI) helps give structure to the
profile. 15. Test with Mock Conversations: Before rolling out to real
users, simulate some users and conversations to test if the engine picks
up the right things. You could create a few archetypal profiles (like a
prototypical ENFP who in conversation says "I love meeting new people
and going on adventures!" etc., versus an ISTJ type who says "I prefer
having a plan and sticking to it."). Run these through the
analyzeMessage function and see if it assigns the expected traits.
Adjust your rules or model if needed. Also test the compatibility
function on these mock profiles -- does it correctly identify that, say,
the adventurous extrovert and the planner introvert might have some
friction (unless other aspects compensate)? Fine-tune weighting
accordingly. 16. Iterate and Enhance Algorithms: Once the basic pipeline
(profiling -\> matching) is in place and tested, you can incrementally
improve each part: 17. Enrich the analyzeMessage logic with more
sophisticated NLP (even possibly use an LLM itself to analyze
conversation in batch -- e.g., after a full convo, ask the model
"summarize this user's personality traits" as a check). 18. Expand the
knowledge base (include more nuance from personality psychology
literature). 19. Adjust the compatibility scoring with any real-world
feedback (if you find certain matches are consistently successful or
failing, recalibrate the algorithm). 20. Work on the SoulAI-to-SoulAI
chat simulation for matches, if you choose to include that as a feature.
This might require quite a bit of prompt engineering to ensure the two
AI agents meaningfully reflect their users. Start simple: perhaps have
them introduce themselves and talk about one topic (like "favorite
weekend activity") and see if they find common ground. 21. Add a
front-end display for the user's own AI to know them. For example,
SoulAI's avatar or profile page might show a fun summary like "SoulAI's
Learned Profile: You seem to be an Analytical Idealist who loves
creativity and values honesty." (Only if you think users would like to
see that -- some might enjoy a summary of how the AI sees them, as long
as it's phrased positively. But recall, the AI shouldn't constantly spit
this out in chat, it would be more like a private profile view.) 22.
Scalability and Streamlining: Since the app is for mobile (Android/iOS),
ensure that all this processing is efficient. Real-time message analysis
should be lightweight (maybe batched if using heavy ML models). You
might start with simple client-side processing. If you move to using an
AI API for analysis, be mindful of latency and costs. Perhaps do
on-device inference if possible for basic models. Prioritize the
features that deliver the most value for matchmaking first (e.g.,
identifying basic personality type and key preferences might yield 80%
of the matching value; fine-grained analysis of every quirk can be a
later improvement).

11

In terms of priority, building the silent learning engine and basic
profile structure (Step 1 and 2) is the top priority -- this creates the
foundation for everything else. Without it, you can't accumulate the
data needed for matching. Right after that, implementing a preliminary
compatibility scoring (Step 3) allows you to start testing the
matchmaking concept, even if the profile data is sparse initially. The
consent and policy (Step 4) should be ready by launch to protect your
company and users, but it doesn't hurt to draft those in parallel with
development. Incorporating the personality knowledge (Step 5) and
refining algorithms (Step 7) will be an ongoing effort, but not required
on day 1 if you use simple logic to start. Always prioritize a
streamlined operation -- i.e., a minimal viable product where the AI
learns a bit and matches on the most important criteria, rather than
trying to perfect every nuance upfront. You can then iterate. By
following this roadmap, you will implement the profiling system in a
logical sequence: first capture data, then utilize it for matching, all
while respecting user privacy and maintaining a smooth user experience.

User Consent, Privacy, and Policy Considerations Because SoulAI's
approach involves analyzing personal conversation data to build a user
profile, it's critical to have strong privacy protections and clear
policies. Here are key considerations and how to align with industry
best practices (like ChatGPT and Google's AI policies): â€¢ Informed User
Consent: As discussed, make sure users opt in to this profiling. The app
should explicitly explain that the AI will learn from their inputs to
personalize matches. This explanation should be in plain language (avoid
scary terms like "surveillance" -- frame it as a benefit: "The more you
chat, the smarter your match suggestions get, as SoulAI learns what you
like and who you are."). Users should tap "I Agree" to this. If they do
not agree, perhaps they can still use the app but with a disclaimer that
matchmaking will be more basic (or maybe they shouldn't use the app if
they don't want any data analysis -- but giving the choice is good
practice). â€¢ Privacy Policy (Data Use and Storage): Your privacy policy
document (and within the app) must outline what data is collected, how
it's used, and how it's stored/protected. Emulate the thoroughness of
OpenAI's privacy policy here. Key points: â€¢ Personal Data Collected:
List that the app collects chat conversations (content of messages) and
potentially profile information that the AI infers (like personality
traits). Even if the inferred traits are algorithmic, they should be
considered personal data about the user. However, reassure that this
data is used only for providing the core service (matchmaking and
improving the AI's responses to the user). â€¢ Data Storage: Explain that
data is stored locally (if using AsyncStorage, mention it's on their
device). If any data goes to servers (for instance, for finding matches
or if you use a cloud AI API), clarify that and what measures are in
place (encryption, etc.). For example, "Your conversation data and
profile remain on your phone and are not uploaded to our servers without
your permission" would be ideal if true. If matchmaking requires server
processing, you might say "Certain profile traits (e.g., your
personality type and interests) may be sent to our server in anonymized
form to compute matches, but your actual conversation logs are not
uploaded." â€¢ Data Sharing: State that you do not share personal user
data with third parties. No selling of data. No advertising use.
Essentially, the user's profile is private. OpenAI also emphasizes it
does not use personal info to build advertising profiles 18 , and you
should mirror that stance for trust.

12

â€¢ Data Retention: Indicate how long data is kept. If it's on the device
indefinitely until they delete, say that. If any data is on servers,
give a retention period or policy (e.g., "matchmaking data is deleted if
you delete your account or after X months of inactivity"). This clarity
is important for compliance and user trust. â€¢ User Rights: If applicable
(especially for legal compliance), mention that users can request their
data be deleted or can export their data. This might be more formal, but
it's part of privacy laws in many regions (GDPR, CCPA etc.). Even if
your initial user base is small, it's good to have this in place. â€¢
Content and Usage Policies: Apart from privacy, consider adopting usage
policies for the AI's behavior similar to ChatGPT's content guidelines.
This protects your company from legal and ethical issues. For example: â€¢
Prohibit the AI from engaging in or generating hateful, harassing, or
extremely inappropriate content, even if provoked by the user. In a
dating app context, users might flirt or even get sexual in chat; you
have to decide boundaries (many dating apps have some content moderation
especially to prevent harassment or illegal behavior). You might let
consensual adult sexual conversation through (if that's part of your
app's scope), but you must block or respond safely to anything
non-consensual, minors, extreme hate speech, etc. For instance, OpenAI's
policies forbid sexual content involving minors categorically 19 , and
similarly you must enforce such rules. â€¢ The AI should also not give
harmful advice. In a relationship context, imagine a user asks SoulAI
for very sensitive advice (like mental health issues or abusive
relationship situations). Your AI's replies should be careful -- likely
including a disclaimer like "I'm not a licensed therapist, but here's
some thoughts... and consider seeking professional help if needed."
Having these guardrails (like ChatGPT has for self-harm or medical
queries) is important to limit liability and actually help users safely.
â€¢ Impersonation and Privacy: The AI should never reveal personal details
about other users or people. If SoulAI-to-SoulAI matching is happening,
it should exchange only profile traits, not any personally identifying
info. If one user tries to get the AI to spill info about another user
beyond what's in that user's public profile, the AI should refuse. This
aligns with privacy principles that the AI shouldn't be used to spy or
obtain private data on someone 18 . â€¢ Transparency (to a point): While
the AI doesn't reveal the contents of the profile to the user in chat,
your app should still somewhere inform the user that the AI's responses
are generated and may not always be 100% accurate or truthful (standard
AI disclaimer). Also clarify that SoulAI is not a human, just in case
(most will know, but it's good to state). â€¢ Terms of Service: Include
clauses that limit your liability -- e.g., "We do not guarantee you will
find a successful match" (obvious but legally useful), "Advice given by
the AI is for informational purposes and not professional counsel," etc.
Also a code of conduct: users shouldn't misuse the AI (for instance,
using it to send abusive messages will get them banned, etc.). â€¢
Security: Follow modern security practices to protect user data within
the app. Use encryption for stored data if possible (AsyncStorage can be
plaintext; consider using an encrypted storage module). When sending any
data to server, use HTTPS and secure databases. This isn't directly the
user's question, but it's part of protecting the company and users. â€¢
Learning from Industry Leaders: It's great that you want to replicate
ChatGPT's and Google Gemini's policies. To do so, you can actually read
through OpenAI's posted policies and adapt them. For example, OpenAI's
user policies explicitly list disallowed content categories (hate,
violence, sexual abuse, self-harm, etc.) -- you can incorporate similar
sections in your app's

13

community guidelines. They also have guidelines about privacy (we saw
that they aim not to profile or target individuals 18 ). While your app
does profile individuals by design, you differentiate by doing it for
the user's benefit with consent, not for advertising or selling data.
Emphasize that distinction in your policy. â€¢ Continuous Compliance
Monitoring: Once the app is live, monitor how it's being used. If users
find loopholes (e.g., someone tries to get their SoulAI to analyze a
third person by copy-pasting someone else's messages -- thus profiling
someone who didn't consent), you should guard against that. Probably out
of scope initially, but keep an eye on unintended uses. By putting
comprehensive privacy and usage policies in place, you protect your
company and build trust with users. Users of dating apps are
understandably concerned about how their personal information is
handled. If you can honestly say, "We respect your privacy: your AI
conversations are only used to help you find love, and nothing more,"
and back that up with solid policy and practice, it will be a strong
selling point.

In conclusion, implementing this "SoulAI" personal profiling and
matching feature is an ambitious but game-changing endeavor. The key
steps involve setting up a silent background learning system, profiling
the user across multiple psychological dimensions, leveraging that
profile for smart compatibility matching (potentially even testing
AI-to-AI interactions), and doing all of this in a privacyconscious,
user-friendly way. Adopting a top-down approach -- starting from broad
personality type down to specific relationship goals -- will ensure you
cover all relevant facets of a person 2 8 . By prioritizing development
of the learning engine and data structure, and then iteratively refining
the insight extraction and matching algorithm, you can create a
streamlined yet powerful matchmaking AI. And by following best practices
on consent and privacy like the major AI platforms 18 , you safeguard
your users and your company. This approach will enable SoulAI to truly
understand each user on a human level and connect people who are
genuinely compatible on deeper levels -- fulfilling the app's mission of
facilitating meaningful relationships, not just superficial matches.
Good luck with building this intelligent Cupid! With careful
implementation, SoulAI could become the dating app experience that feels
less like swiping on profiles and more like having a personal
relationship coach who really knows you guiding you to the right
partner. 6 15 Sources: â€¢ SoulSync AI Dating App -- example of using
